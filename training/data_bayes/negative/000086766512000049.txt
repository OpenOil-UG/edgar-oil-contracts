Section 3. New Lender; Reallocation of Commitments and Advances.

 

(a) The Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each Lender party to the Credit Agreement immediately prior to the Effective Date have agreed that on the Effective Date, (i) Cadence Bank (the “New Lender”) shall become a Lender, the Documentation Agent, and a party to the Credit Agreement and bound by the terms thereof and the other Loan Documents and (ii) ING Capital LLC (the “Exiting Lender”) shall no longer be a Lender or a party to the Credit Agreement.

 

(b) On the Effective Date and after giving effect to foregoing, the Commitment Amounts of each Lender (including the New Lender) shall be reallocated and restated as set forth on Schedule I of this Agreement, which Schedule I supersedes and replaces the Schedule I to the Credit Agreement.  Any reallocation of the Commitment Amounts among the Lenders and the Exiting Lender shall be deemed to have been consummated pursuant to the terms of the Assignment and Assumption attached as Exhibit A to the Credit Agreement as if such Lenders and the Exiting Lender had executed an Assignment and Assumption with respect to such reallocation.  The Borrower and the Administrative Agent hereby consent to any such assignment and reallocation.  The Administrative Agent hereby waives the $3,500 processing and recording fee set forth in Section 9.08(b)(iv) of the Credit Agreement with respect to the assignments and reallocations contemplated by this Section 3.

The Lenders (including the New Lender) have agreed to reallocate the outstanding Advances funded prior to the Second Amendment Effective Date (the “Existing Advances”), such that as of the Effective Date each Lender (including the New Lender) holds the same pro rata share of the Existing Advances as its Pro Rata Share of the Commitments after giving effect to this Amendment and such share shall be acquired free and clear of any Liens created by, through or under the transferring Lender.  Accordingly, the Lenders shall, through the Administrative Agent, make such adjustments among themselves as shall be necessary so that after giving effect to such adjustments and reallocations the Lenders shall hold the Existing Advances in the amounts in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares as of the Effective Date.  With respect to the Existing Advances, each Lender (other than the New Lender) and the Exiting Lender shall receive all interest and fees accrued on its portion thereof in accordance with its Pro Rata Share (as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Date) to but excluding the Effective Date.  Interest and fees accruing on the Existing Advances on and after the Effective Date shall be paid to the Lenders (including the New Lender) in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement.
