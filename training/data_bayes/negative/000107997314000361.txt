7.  DIFFICULT OR HAZARDOUS DRILLING:




(a) In the event, pyrite, quartzite, granite, igneous rock or other impenetrable substance is encountered while drilling on the footage basis, and the footage   drilled during each 24-hour period multiplied by the footage rate does not at least equal the applicable daywork rate plus the CONTRACTOR'S cost of bits, mud and water used during the 24 hour period, all subsequent drilling operations shall be conducted on :a daywork basis at the - applicable daywork rate, with OPERATOR furnishing the bits, mud, and water, until normal drilling operations. and procedures can be resumed. No footage charge shall be made for footage drilled while on daywork rates; If such conditions are encountered while drilling on the turnkey basis,  all subsequent drilling operations shall be conducted on a daywork basis at the applicable daywork rate, with OPERATOR furnishing the bits, mud, and water until normal drilling operations and procedures can be resumed. The turnkey charge shall be adjusted by a negotiated amount to reflect the portion of the drilling operation drilled at daywork rates.




(b)  In the event water flow, domal, steeply dipping or faulted formation, abnormal pressure, underground mine or cavern, heaving formation, salt or other conditions are encountered which makes drilling abnormally difficult or hazardous, causes sticking of drill pipe or casing, or other difficulty occurs which precludes drilling ahead under reasonably normal procedures, CONTRACTOR shall, in all such cases, without undue delay, exert reasonable efforts to overcome such difficulty, When such condition is encountered, further operations shall be conducted on a daywork basis at the applicable daywork rate, with OPERATOR furnishing the bits, mud and water, until such conditions have been overcome and normal drilling operations can be resumed. OPERATOR shall assume the .risk of loss or damage to the hole and to CONTRACTOR'S equipment in the hole from the time such condition is encountered. If.the drilling is being   performed on a footage basis, no charge shall be made for footage drilled while on daywork rates. Ifdrilling is being performed on a turnkey basis, the daywork charge incurred hereunder shall be a separate charge to the OPERATOR and the turnkey charge shall be adjusted by a negotiated amount to reflect the portion of the drilling operations drilled at daywork rates.




(c)  In the event loss of circulation is encountered, CONTRACTOR shall, without undue delay, exert reasonable effort to overcome such condition. When such condition is encountered, OPERATOR shall assume and bear the risk of loss or damage to the hole and to CONTRACTOR'S equipment in the hole. Should such conditions persist in spite of CONTRACTOR'S efforts to overcome it, then after the period of time specified in Exhibit A under "Lost Circulation" is consumed in such efforts, further operations shall be conducted on a daywork basis at the applicable daywork rate, with OPERATOR furnishing the bits, mud and water until such condition has been overcome and normal drilling operations can be resumed. If the drilling is being performed on a footage basis, no footage charge shall be made for footage drilled while on daywork rates. If the drilling is performed on a turnkey basis, the daywork charge incurred hereunder shall be separate charge to the OPERATOR and the turnkey charge shall be adjusted by a negotiated amount to reflect the portion of the drilling operation drilled at daywork rates.
