The purchase price for the Assets shall be $173,894,419.31 (the “Initial Purchase Price”), subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement (as adjusted, the “Purchase Price”).  The Purchase Price shall be payable as follows:(a)Upon execution hereof, Seller, Buyer and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the “Escrow Agent”) shall enter into the escrow agreement (the “Escrow Agreement”) in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit E, and Buyer shall deposit with Escrow Agent into an escrow account (“Escrow Account”), by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the Initial Purchase Price (the “Deposit”).  The Deposit and accrued interest thereon shall be applied to the Closing Amount (as defined in Section 2.3 below) at Closing.  Upon any termination of this Agreement, the Deposit and accrued interest thereon shall be paid to Seller or returned to Buyer in accordance with Article 11.  Escrow fees charged by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement shall be paid one-half by Seller and one-half by Buyer.  As used herein, the term “Business Day” shall mean any day on which national banks are open for business in Midland, Texas.(b)After Closing, final adjustments to the Initial Purchase Price shall be made pursuant to the Final Settlement Statement to be delivered pursuant to Section 13.1(a) and payments made by Buyer or Seller as provided in Section 13.1(a).2.2Allocation of the Purchase Price.  The Initial Purchase Price is allocated among the Assets as set forth on Schedule 2.2, which amounts shall be referred to as the “Allocated Value.”2.3Adjustments to Purchase Price and Preliminary Settlement.  The Initial Purchase Price shall be adjusted according to this Section 2.3 without duplication.  Seller shall deliver to Buyer at least five (5) Business Days prior to Closing a draft settlement statement (“Preliminary Settlement Statement”) that shall set forth the adjusted Initial Purchase Price reflecting each adjustment in accordance with this Agreement as of the date of preparation of such Preliminary Settlement Statement, together with all documents reasonably necessary to support Seller's estimated adjustments to the Initial Purchase Price as set forth in the Preliminary Settlement Statement.  If Buyer notifies Seller on or before the Closing Date that it disputes Seller's estimate of the adjustments to the Initial Purchase Price and the Parties cannot agree to the adjustments prior to Closing, then the Purchase Price paid at Closing shall be the amount 3that is midway between Seller's and Buyer's estimated amounts.  The Preliminary Settlement Statement will be used to adjust the Initial Purchase Price at Closing, which adjusted amount is referred to herein as the “Closing Amount.” (a)Proration of Costs and Revenues.  Buyer shall be entitled to all production of Hydrocarbons from or attributable to the Leases, Lands, and Wells at and after the Effective Time (and all products and proceeds attributable thereto), and to all other income, proceeds, receipts and credits earned with respect to the Assets at or after the Effective Time, and shall be responsible for (and entitled to any refunds with respect to) all Property Expenses (as defined in Section 2.3(b) below) incurred at and after the Effective Time.  Seller shall be entitled to all proceeds from Hydrocarbon production from or attributable to the Leases, Lands, and Wells prior to the Effective Time, and to all other income, proceeds, receipts and credits earned with respect to the Assets prior to the Effective Time, and shall be responsible for (and entitled to any refunds with respect to) all Property Expenses incurred prior to the Effective Time.  The terms “earned” and “incurred”, as used in this Agreement shall be interpreted in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles utilized by Seller, except as otherwise specified herein.  For purposes of allocating production (and accounts receivable with respect thereto), under this Section 2.3(a), (i) liquid Hydrocarbons, including natural gas liquids, shall be deemed to be “from or attributable to” the Leases, Lands, and Wells when they pass through the pipeline connecting into the storage facilities into which they are run or into tanks connected to the Wells and (ii) gaseous Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be “from or attributable to” the Leases, Lands, and Wells when they pass through the royalty measurement meters, delivery point sales meters or custody transfer meters on the gathering lines or pipelines through which they are transported (whichever meter is closest to the well).  Seller shall utilize reasonable interpolative procedures, consistent with industry practice, to arrive at an allocation of production when exact meter readings or gauging and strapping data are not available.  As part of the Preliminary Settlement Statement, Seller shall provide to Buyer, all data necessary to support any estimated allocation, for purposes of establishing the Closing Amount.(b)Property Expenses.  The term “Property Expenses” means all capital expenses (including all capital expenditures authorized by Section 8.1(a) and operating expenses incurred in the ownership, development and operation of the Assets in the ordinary course of business and, where applicable, in accordance with any relevant operating agreement, if any, and all Lease rental and maintenance costs, net profit payments, royalties, overriding royalties and other similar burdens incurred in connection with the Leases or the production and sale of Hydrocarbons therefrom, but excluding Production Taxes (which shall be apportioned as of the Effective Time in accordance with Article 9).  “Property Expenses” shall include overhead for the period between the Effective Time and the Closing Date based upon the applicable joint operating agreement; provided, however, that where no joint operating agreement is applicable, the overhead shall be eight hundred dollars ($800.00) per month for each producing Well, prorated for partial months.(c)Upward Adjustments.  To calculate the Closing Amount, the Initial Purchase Price shall be adjusted upward by the following:(1)The proceeds received by Buyer, net of royalties, overriding royalties, profit payments and similar burdens, from the sale of any Hydrocarbons that were produced from the Assets prior to the Effective Time;  (2)An amount equal to all Property Expenses attributable to the Assets for the period from and after the Effective Time that were paid by Seller prior to Closing;(3)An amount equal to the value of (i) all oil and other Hydrocarbons in pipelines or flowlines or in tanks above the pipeline sales connection (exclusive of any brine, sludge or water that may be present in the oil storage tanks), in each case that at the Effective Time, estimated based on run tickets as of the Effective Time, is credited to Seller's interest in the Leases, Lands or Wells and (ii) all unsold inventory of gas plant products attributable to Seller's interests in the Leases, Lands or Wells at the Effective Time, each such value to be the contract price in effect as of the Effective Time or, in the absence of an applicable contract price, the average price per unit for sales of production for the respective production period attributable to the Leases, Lands or Wells as of the Effective Time, less any applicable royalties;4(4)To the extent that there are any pipeline imbalances, if the net of such imbalances is an overdelivery imbalance (that is, at the Effective Time, Seller has delivered more gas to the pipeline than the pipeline has redelivered for Seller), the Purchase Price shall be adjusted upward by the first-of-the-month price of spot gas delivered to pipelines for El Paso Natural Gas Co. (Permian Basin) as reported in Inside F.E.R.C.'s Gas Market Report for the month in which the Effective Time occurs times the net overdelivery imbalance in MMbtus.  In the event such publication shall cease to be published, the Parties shall select a comparable publication; and(5)Any other amount provided for in this Agreement or otherwise agreed to by Buyer and Seller.(d)Downward Adjustments.  To calculate the Closing Amount, the Initial Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by the following:(1)An amount equal to the Title Defect Adjustment, if any, pursuant to Section 4.2(f);(2)An amount equal to the Environmental Defect Adjustment, if any, pursuant to Section 5.6(a)(1);(3)An amount equal to the Allocated Value of Assets not conveyed at Closing due to the exercise of any preferential rights to purchase in accordance with Section 4.4(b) or the failure to obtain a consent to assign in accordance with Section 4.4(a);(4)Any proceeds on Hydrocarbons produced from and after the Effective Time, net of royalties, overriding royalties, net profit payments and similar burdens, received by Seller between the Effective Time and Closing relating to the Assets;(5)An amount equal to all Property Expenses attributable to the Assets for the period prior to the Effective Time that are paid by Buyer; (6)To the extent that there are any pipeline imbalances, if the net of such imbalances is an underdelivery imbalance (that is, at the Effective Time, Seller has delivered less gas to the pipeline than the pipeline has redelivered for Seller), the Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by the first-of-the-month price of spot gas delivered to pipelines for El Paso Natural Gas Co. (Permian Basin) as reported in Inside F.E.R.C.'s Gas Market Report for the month in which the Effective Time occurs times the net underdelivery imbalance in MMbtus.  In the event such publication shall cease to be published, the Parties shall select a comparable publication;(7)The value of any Casualty Loss pursuant to Section 8.3(c);(8)An amount equal to the revenue from the Wells held in suspense by Seller for third party leasehold interests and for royalties, overriding royalties and similar leasehold burdens, including, without limitation, the suspensed revenues identified in accordance with Section 8.1(i); and(9)Any other amount provided in this Agreement or otherwise agreed to by Buyer and Seller.(e)Well Imbalance Adjustments.  Seller and Buyer agree that the Purchase Price will be adjusted downward or upward, as appropriate, by an amount equal to the well imbalances existing as of the Effective Time multiplied by the average value on an MMbtu basis at the wellhead for sales of production during the month in which the Effective Time occurs.ARTICLE 3BUYER'S INSPECTION53.1Due Diligence.  Upon execution of this Agreement, but subject to the other provisions of this Agreement (including this Section 3.1) and obtaining any required consents of third parties (with respect to which consents Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain), Seller will afford Buyer and its representatives reasonable access to the Assets during normal business hours for inspection, review and copying to permit Buyer to perform its due diligence (such due diligence, the “Due Diligence Review”) as hereinafter provided.  All notices pertaining to Title Defects and Environmental Defects based on the Due Diligence Review must be received by Seller no later than 5:00 p.m., Mountain Time, on February 20, 2012 (the “Defect Notice Date”).3.2Access to Records.  From the date hereof and through the Closing Date, Seller shall provide Buyer, and its counsel, accountants and other representatives, reasonable access during normal business hours to the Records to enable Buyer to complete its Due Diligence Review.3.3On-Site Inspection.  Seller hereby consents to Buyer and its representatives conducting, prior to Closing and upon advance notice to Seller, at Buyer's sole risk and expense, (i) on-site inspections; and (ii) an environmental assessment no more stringent than an ASTM Phase One Environmental Assessment (an “Environmental Assessment”) of the Assets.  In connection with any Environmental Assessment, Buyer agrees not to interfere with the normal operation of the Assets and agrees to comply with all written requirements and safety policies of the operator.  The Parties shall execute a “common undertaking” letter regarding the confidentiality of an Environmental Assessment in any case where Buyer is required pursuant hereto to provide Seller with a copy of any part of Buyer's Environmental Assessment.  In the event Buyer determines that more than an Environmental Assessment is required in order to properly determine the environmental condition of an Asset, including, without limitation, the conducting of invasive sampling or testing, then Buyer shall provide Seller with a copy of the Environmental Assessment prepared with respect to such Asset and a written request describing the proposed activities to be performed; provided, however, that no such activities shall be performed by Buyer without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.  Any dispute between the Parties arising in connection with a request by Buyer to perform additional activities beyond an Environmental Assessment shall be finally determined by binding arbitration in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 15.17.  Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other terms and provisions of this Agreement, in the event Buyer determines, in its reasonable discretion, that more than an Environmental Assessment is required in order to properly determine the environmental condition of an Asset and Seller refuses to consent to such activities, then Buyer shall have the right at any time prior to Closing to remove the affected Asset from the Transaction and reduce the Purchase Price by the Allocated Value of such Asset, in which case such Asset shall constitute an Excluded Asset.3.4Indemnification.  Buyer agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless each of the operators of the Assets, Seller and the other Seller Indemnified Parties from and against any and all Losses caused by any field visit, on-site inspection, Environmental Assessment or other due diligence activity conducted by Buyer or any representative of Buyer with respect to the Assets, EVEN IF SUCH LIABILITIES ARISE OUT OF OR RESULT FROM THE ACTIVE, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT OR VIOLATION OF LAW OF OR BY A SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTY, EXCEPTING ONLY LIABILITIES RESULTING FROM OR ARISING OUT OF THE SOLE NEGLIGENCE, GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF A SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTY.3.5Insurance.  During all periods that Buyer and/or any of Buyer's representatives are present on the Assets, Buyer shall maintain, at its sole expense, policies of insurance covering Buyer's and its representatives' activities and presence on the Assets, which insurance shall be of the type and in the amounts consistent with sound business practices.  ARTICLE 4TITLE MATTERS4.1Seller's Title.  (a)Limited Defensible Title Representation.  Seller represents and warrants to Buyer that, as of the Effective Time and as of the Defect Notice Date, its title to the Leases and Wells is Defensible 6Title as defined in Section 4.1(c).  Except as set forth in this Section 4.1(a) and the Assignment, Bill of Sale and Conveyance to be delivered at Closing, the form of which is attached hereto as Exhibit D, Seller makes no warranty or representation, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to Seller's title to the Leases and Wells and Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that Buyer's sole remedy for any defect of title, including any Title Defect, with respect to any of the Leases and Wells before Closing, shall be Buyer's right to adjust the Purchase Price to the extent provided in this Article 4, or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1(f).(b)Exclusive Remedy. With the exception of the special warranty of title in the Assignment, Bill of Sale and Conveyance, as described in Section 4.1(a), (i) the representation and warranty in Section 4.1(a) shall terminate as of the Defect Notice Date and shall have no further force and effect thereafter, and (ii) Section 4.2 shall be the exclusive right and remedy of Buyer with respect to Seller's failure to have Defensible Title with respect to the Leases and Wells.(c)Defensible Title - Leases and Wells.  The term “Defensible Title” means such ownership of record deducible from the applicable county, state and federal records, such that a prudent person engaged in the business of the ownership, development and operation of oil and gas leasehold and properties and having knowledge of all of the facts and their legal bearing would be willing to accept the same, to the Leases, Lands and Wells, and that, subject to and except for Permitted Encumbrances as defined in Section 4.1(d):  (1)Entitles Seller (and Buyer from and after the Effective Time) to receive a share of the Hydrocarbons produced, saved and marketed from any Lease or Well throughout the duration of the productive life of such Lease or Well or such specified zone(s) therein after satisfaction of all royalties, overriding royalties, nonparticipating royalties, net profits interests, production payments or other similar burdens on or measured by production of Hydrocarbons (a “Net Revenue Interest”), of not less than the Net Revenue Interest or NRI shown in Exhibit A and Exhibit B for such Lease or Well except for (i) decreases in connection with those operations in which Seller may, from and after the date of this Agreement, be a non-consenting co-owner (to the extent permitted pursuant to Section 8.1(a) or 8.1(b)), (ii) decreases resulting from the establishment or amendment from and after the date of this Agreement of pools or units (to the extent permitted pursuant to Section 8.1(a) or 8.1(b), and (iii) as otherwise stated in Exhibit A and Exhibit B;(2)Obligates Seller (and Buyer from and after the Effective Time) to bear a percentage of the costs and expenses for the maintenance, development, operation and the production relating to any Lease or Well throughout the productive life of such Lease or Well (“Working Interest”) not greater than the Working Interest or WI shown in Exhibit A and Exhibit B for such Lease or Well without increase, except (i)  increases to the extent that they are accompanied by a proportionate increase in Seller's Net Revenue Interest, (ii) increases resulting from contribution requirements with respect to defaults by co-owners from and after the date of this Agreement under applicable joint operating agreements (to the extent permitted pursuant to Section 8.1(a) or 8.1(b), and (iii) as otherwise stated in Exhibit A and Exhibit B;(3)Results in Seller owning at least the number of total net mineral acres set forth in Exhibit A (“Net Acres”), provided that there shall be no duplication of Title Defects asserted under this Section 4.1(c)(3) and under Sections 4.1(c)(1) or (2); and(4)is free and clear of liens, encumbrances and defects.(d)Permitted Encumbrances. The term “Permitted Encumbrances” shall mean:(1)lessors' royalties, overriding royalties, net profits interests, production payments, reversionary interests and similar burdens if the net cumulative effect of such burdens does not operate to reduce the Net Revenue Interests of Seller (or Buyer from and after the Effective Time) below those set forth on Exhibit A and Exhibit B;7(2)liens for Taxes or assessments not yet due or delinquent, provided in each case that Seller has agreed to pay the same pursuant to the terms of this Agreement;(3)all rights to consent by, required notices to, filings with, or other actions by Governmental Entities, in connection with the conveyance of the applicable Asset if the same are customarily sought after such conveyance;(4)conventional rights of reassignment contained in any Leases, or assignments thereof, providing for reassignment upon the surrender or expiration of any Leases;(5)easements, rights-of-way, servitudes, permits, surface leases and other rights with respect to surface operations, on, over or in respect of any of the Assets that do not materially reduce or interfere with the operation, development, ownership or value of the affected Asset as currently conducted; (6)materialmen's, mechanics', operators' or other similar liens arising in the ordinary course of business if such liens and charges are for payments that have not yet become due or delinquent and Seller has agreed to make such payments pursuant to the terms of this Agreement;(7)such Title Defects (as defined in Section 4.2(a)) as Buyer has waived;(8)any defects, irregularities or deficiencies in title to easements, rights-of-way or surface use agreements that do not materially adversely affect the operation, development, use, ownership or value of any Asset;(9)the Contracts set forth on Exhibit C, to the extent complete executed copies of such Contracts are included in the Records and the same do not operate to reduce the Net Revenue Interests of Seller, or Buyer from and after the Effective Time, below those set forth in Exhibit A and Exhibit B, increase the Working Interests of Seller, or Buyer from and after the Effective Time, above those set forth in Exhibit A and Exhibit B without a corresponding increase in the Net Revenue Interests, delay or prevent timely drilling and development of the Assets or receipt of proceeds of Hydrocarbon production therefrom, or materially interfere with, diminish or detract from the ownership, operation, development, value or use of the affected Assets;(10)any liens burdening the Assets that are released at or before Closing, as contemplated by this Agreement; and(11)all other liens, charges, encumbrances, contracts, agreements, instruments, obligations, defects and irregularities affecting the Assets that do not (or would not upon foreclosure or other enforcement) reduce the Net Revenue Interest set forth in Exhibit A and Exhibit B or prevent the receipt of proceeds of production therefrom, increase the share of costs above the Working Interest set forth in Exhibit A and Exhibit B (unless the Net Revenue Interest is greater than the Net Revenue Interest set forth on Exhibit A and Exhibit B, in the same proportion as any increase in such Working Interest) or materially interfere with or detract from the ownership, operation, development, value or use of the Assets burdened thereby.4.2Title Adjustment Procedures(a)Title Defect.  As used in this Agreement, the term “Title Defect” means any lien, charge, encumbrance, obligation (including contract obligation), defect, condition or other matter (including without limitation a discrepancy in Net Revenue Interest or Working Interest) that causes a breach of Seller's representation and warranty in Section 4.1(a).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following shall not be considered Title Defects:(1)defects based solely on lack of information in Seller's files that is filed of record;8(2)defects in the chain of title arising prior to the year 2001 and consisting of the mere failure to recite marital status in a document or omission of probate succession, heirship or estate proceedings, unless Buyer provides reasonable evidence that such failure or omission results in another person's actual and superior claim of title to the relevant Asset;(3)defects asserting a change in Working Interest or Net Revenue Interest based on a change in drilling and spacing units, tract allocation or other changes in pool or unit participation occurring after the date of this Agreement (to the extent such changes are permitted by Section 8.1(a) or 8.1(b));(4)defects arising prior to the year 2001 out of lack of corporate or other entity authorization unless Buyer provides a reasonable basis for the assertion that such corporate or other entity action was not authorized and results in another person's actual and superior claim of title to the relevant Asset; or(5)defects that have been cured by applicable laws of limitations or prescription such that any claim against Seller's title is barred.(b)Title Benefit.  As used in this Agreement, the term “Title Benefit” shall mean any right, circumstance or condition that operates to (a) increase the Net Revenue Interest being assigned to Buyer in any Lease or Well above that shown for such Lease or Well in Exhibit A and Exhibit B, to the extent the same does not cause a greater than proportionate increase in the Working Interest being assigned to Buyer therein above that shown in Exhibit A and Exhibit B, or (b) increase the Net Acres being assigned to Buyer in any Lease to greater than that shown therefor in Exhibit A.  (c)Notice of Defective Interest.  On or before the Defect Notice Date, Buyer shall advise Seller in writing of any matters that in Buyer's reasonable opinion constitute a Title Defect with respect to Seller's title to all or any portion of the Leases and Wells (“Notice of Defective Interest”).  The Notice of Defective Interest shall be in writing and contain the following:  (i) a description of the alleged Title Defect(s), (ii) the Leases or Wells (and the applicable zone(s) therein) affected by the alleged Title Defect (each a “Title Defect Property”), (iii) the Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property, (iv) supporting documentation reasonably necessary for Seller (as well as any title attorney or examiner hired by Seller) to verify the existence of the alleged Title Defect(s), and (v) the amount by which Buyer reasonably believes the Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property is reduced by the alleged Title Defect(s) and the computations and information upon which Buyer's belief is based.  To give Seller an opportunity to commence reviewing and curing Title Defects, Buyer agrees to use reasonable efforts to give Seller, on or before the end of each calendar week prior to the Defect Notice Date, written notice of all Title Defects discovered by Buyer or any of its representatives, during the calendar week preceding the calendar week then ending, which may be preliminary in nature and supplemented prior to the Defect Notice Date; provided, however, that the failure of Buyer to give Seller any such preliminary notices shall not waive any Title Defects or constitute a breach of this Agreement.  Buyer shall also promptly furnish Seller with written notice of any Title Benefit which is discovered by Buyer or any of its representatives while conducting Buyer's title review, due diligence or investigation with respect to the Leases or Wells.(d)Notice of Title Benefits.  On or before the Defect Notice Date, Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to advise Buyer in writing of any matters that in Seller's reasonable opinion constitute a Title Benefit with respect to Seller's title to all or any portion of the Leases and Wells (a “Title Benefit Notice”).  The Title Benefit Notice shall be in writing and contain the following:  (i) a description of the Title Benefit, (ii) the Leases or Wells (and the applicable zone(s) therein) affected by the Title Benefit (“Title Benefit Property”), (iii) the Allocated Values of the Leases or Wells (and the applicable zone(s) therein) subject to such Title Benefit, (iv) supporting documentation reasonably necessary for Buyer to verify the existence of the alleged Title Benefit, and (v) the amount by which the Seller reasonably believes the Allocated Value of those Leases or Wells (and the applicable zone(s) therein) is increased by the Title Benefit, and the computations and information upon which Seller's belief is based. Seller shall be deemed to have waived all Title Benefits of which it has not given notice on or before the Defect Notice Date.(e)Seller's Right to Cure.  Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at its sole 9cost, to cure or remove at any time prior to Closing (the “Cure Period”), to Buyer's reasonable satisfaction, any Title Defects of which it has been advised by Buyer.(f)Remedies for Title Defects.  Subject to Seller's continuing right to dispute the existence of a Title Defect or the Title Defect Amount asserted with respect thereto, in the event that any Title Defect timely asserted by Buyer in accordance with Section 4.2(c) actually exists and is not waived by Buyer or cured on or before Closing, Seller shall convey the Title Defect Property to Buyer at Closing with a reduction to the Purchase Price, provided, however, that Seller shall retain the right to cure such Title Defects after Closing as provided below.  The reduction to the Purchase Price contemplated by the foregoing sentence shall equal the amount of the aggregate Title Defect Amounts for all such Title Defects as determined pursuant to Section 4.2(g), subject to the Individual Title Threshold and the Aggregate Deductible set forth in Section 4.2(i), less an amount equal to the aggregate of all Title Benefit Amounts (as so calculated, the “Title Defect Adjustment”).  Seller shall have one hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing Date (the “Post-Closing Cure Period”) in which to attempt to cure any such Title Defects subject to the continuing application of the Individual Title Threshold and the Aggregate Deductible.  Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to cooperate with Seller's efforts to cure such Title Defects.  If Seller cures any such Title Defect to Buyer's reasonable satisfaction prior to the end of the Post-Closing Cure Period, then the Title Defect Amount with respect to the Title Defect that is so cured shall promptly be paid by Buyer to Seller.(g)Title Defect Amount.  The “Title Defect Amount” means the amount by which the value of the Title Defect Property affected by such Title Defect is reduced as a result of the existence of such Title Defect and shall be determined in accordance with the following methodology, terms and conditions:(1)if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Defect Amount, that amount shall be the Title Defect Amount;(2)if the Title Defect is a lien, encumbrance or other charge which is undisputed and liquidated in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the amount of the payment necessary to remove the Title Defect from the Title Defect Property;(3)if the Title Defect represents a decrease between (A) the actual Net Acres for any Title Defect Property and (B) the Net Acres for such Title Defect Property stated in Exhibit A, then the Title Defect Amount shall be an amount equal to (x) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Allocated Value attributable to such Title Defect Property and the denominator of which is the number of Net Acres for such Title Defect Property stated in Exhibit A, multiplied by (y) the difference between (I) the Net Acres for such Title Defect Property stated in Exhibit A, and (II) the actual Net Acres for any Title Defect Property; and(4)if the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden or charge upon or other defect in title to the Title Defect Property of a type not described in subsections (1) or (2) above, the Title Defect Amount shall be determined by taking into account the following factors:  (i) any discrepancy between (A) the Net Revenue Interest or Working Interest for any Title Defect Property and (B) the Net Revenue Interest or Working Interest stated in Exhibit A and Exhibit B; (ii) the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property; (iii) the portion of the Title Defect Property affected by the Title Defect; (iv) the legal effect of the Title Defect; (v) the values placed upon the Title Defect by Buyer and Seller and (vi) such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation.Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 4, the aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title Defects upon any Title Defect Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property.(h)Title Benefit Amount.  “Title Benefit Amount” means the amount by which the value of the Title Benefit Property affected by such Title Benefit is increased as a result of the existence of such Title Benefit and shall be determined in accordance with the following methodology, terms and conditions:(1)if Buyer and Seller agree on the amount of the Title Benefit, that amount shall be the 10Title Benefit Amount;(2)if the Title Benefit represents an increase between (A) the actual Net Acres for any Title Benefit Property and (B) the Net Acres for such Title Benefit Property stated in Exhibit A, then the Title Benefit Amount shall be an amount equal to (x) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Allocated Value attributable to such Title Benefit Property and the denominator of which is the number of Net Acres for such Title Benefit Property stated in Exhibit A, multiplied by (y) the difference between (I) the actual Net Acres for any Title Benefit Property and (II) the Net Acres for such Title Benefit Property stated in Exhibit A;(3)if the Title Benefit is of a type not described above, then the applicable Title Benefit Amount shall be determined by taking into account the following factors:  (i) any discrepancy between (A) the Net Revenue Interest or Working Interest for any Title Benefit Property and (B) the Net Revenue Interest or Working Interest stated in Exhibit A and Exhibit B; (ii) the Allocated Value of the Title Benefit Property; (iii) the portion of the Title Benefit Property affected by the Title Benefit; (iv) the legal effect of the Title Benefit; and (v) such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation; and(4)if a Title Benefit Property has no Allocated Value, then such Title Benefit Property shall have no Title Benefit Amount.(i)Title Deductibles.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller for any individual Title Defect for which the Title Defect Amount does not exceed thirty-five thousand dollars ($35,000) (“Individual Title Threshold”); and (ii) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller for any Title Defect that exceeds the Individual Title Threshold unless the aggregate amount of the Title Defect Amounts for all Title Defects that exceed the Individual Title Threshold (excluding any Title Defects cured by Seller and less an amount equal to the aggregate of all Title Benefit Amounts) plus the Environmental Defect Value of all Environmental Defects, in the aggregate, exceeds three and one half percent (3.5%) of the Initial Purchase Price (“Aggregate Deductible”), after which point Buyer shall be entitled to adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies only with respect to such Title Defects in excess of the Aggregate Deductible.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Individual Title Threshold and the Aggregate Deductible shall not apply to Title Defects arising from Seller's failure to obtain any third party consents to assign any of the Assets to Buyer, such that Buyer shall receive an adjustment to the Purchase Price equal to the full Title Defect Amounts attributable to any such Title Defects.  4.3Title Dispute Resolution.  The Parties agree to resolve disputes concerning the following matters pursuant to this Section 4.3:  (i) the existence and scope of a Title Defect or Title Benefit, (ii) the Title Defect Amount or Title Benefit Amount, as the case may be, relating to the portion of the Asset affected by a Title Defect or Title Benefit and (iii) the adequacy of Seller's Title Defect curative materials and Buyer's reasonable satisfaction thereof (the “Title Disputed Matters”).  The Parties agree to attempt to initially resolve all disputes through good faith negotiations.  If the Parties cannot resolve disputes regarding items (i), (ii) and (iii) on or before Closing, the affected Asset shall be conveyed to Buyer at Closing and Buyer shall pay an amount equal to the aggregate of all claimed Title Defect Amounts with respect to Title Disputed Matters into the Escrow Account.  The Escrow Agreement shall provide, with respect to the Title Disputed Matters, that funds will be released from the Escrow Account only upon the joint written instructions of the Parties (which instructions shall be given by the Parties so as to give effect to the decision of the Arbitrator within five (5) Business Days after the Arbitrator renders a decision pursuant to Section 15.17).  Further, the Title Disputed Matters will be finally determined by binding arbitration pursuant to Section 15.17. 4.4Consents and Preferential Purchase Rights.  The remedies set forth in this Section 4.4 are the exclusive remedies under this Agreement for consents to assign and preferential rights to purchase.(a)Consents.  All required consents to assignment that are necessary for Seller to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement (each, a “Required Consent”) are set forth on Schedule 4.4(a). Seller shall use reasonable efforts to obtain all Required Consents prior to Closing.  Consents and approvals which are customarily obtained post-Closing shall not be considered Required Consents.  If prior to Closing, Seller fails to obtain 11a Required Consent to assign that would invalidate the conveyance of the Asset affected by the consent to assign, that would materially affect the value or use of the Asset (“Affected Asset”) or that Buyer is unwilling to waive as a Title Defect (provided that Buyer shall have no right to waive Seller's failure to obtain any Material Consent), then Seller shall retain the Affected Asset and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of the Affected Asset.  Seller, with Buyer's assistance, shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain such Required Consent as promptly as possible following Closing.  If such Required Consent has been obtained as of the Final Settlement Date, Seller shall convey the Affected Asset to Buyer effective as of the Effective Time and Buyer shall pay Seller the Allocated Value of the Affected Asset, less any proceeds from the Affected Asset attributable to the period of time after the Effective Time received and retained by Seller (net of any Property Expenses paid by Seller attributable to such period) and otherwise subject to the Purchase Price adjustments provided for in this Agreement.  If such Required Consent has not been obtained as of the Final Settlement Date, the Affected Asset shall be excluded from the sale and the Purchase Price shall be deemed to be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of the Affected Asset.  Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with Seller in obtaining any Required Consent including providing assurances of reasonable financial conditions, but Buyer shall not be required to expend funds or make any other type of financial commitments in order to obtain such consent.(b)Preferential Purchase Rights.  All preferential rights to purchase that are necessary for Seller to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement are set forth on Schedule 4.4(b).  Prior to Closing, Seller shall use reasonable good faith efforts to give notices required in connection with such preferential purchase rights together with any other preferential rights to purchase discovered by Buyer prior to Closing.  If any preferential right to purchase any portion of the Assets is timely and properly exercised prior to Closing, then that portion of the Assets affected by such preferential purchase right shall be sold to the exercising party on the same terms and conditions provided in this Agreement and the Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such affected Assets.  Upon the consummation of any such sale of Assets to an exercising third party, the Assets sold shall be deemed to be Excluded Assets.  If by Closing, the time frame for the exercise of a preferential purchase right has not expired and Seller has not received written notice of an intent not to exercise or a written waiver of the preferential purchase right, then Seller shall retain the affected Assets and the Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such affected Assets.  As to any Assets retained by Seller hereunder, following Closing if a preferential right to purchase is not consummated within the time frame specified in the preferential purchase right, or if the time frame for exercise of the preferential purchase right expired without exercise after the Closing, Seller shall promptly convey the affected Asset to Buyer effective as of the Effective Time, and Buyer shall pay the Allocated Value thereof pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, subject to applicable Purchase Price adjustments provided in this Agreement.ARTICLE 5ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS5.1Definitions.

On or before the Defect Notice Date, Buyer shall give Seller written notice of any Environmental Defects as to which Buyer has knowledge prior to the Defect Notice Date (an “Environmental Defect Notice”).  Buyer shall be deemed to have waived its right to assert an Environmental Defect if Buyer does not include such Environmental Defect in an Environmental Defect Notice delivered to Seller on or before the Defect Notice Date.  An Environmental Defect Notice shall contain the following: (i) a description of the Condition in, on, under or relating to the Asset that causes the alleged Environmental Defect; (ii) a description of the Asset affected by the alleged Environmental Defect (each an “Environmental Defect Property”); (iii) the Allocated Value of each Environmental Defect Property; (iv) supporting documentation reasonably necessary for Seller (as well as any consultant hired by Seller) to verify the existence of the alleged Environmental Defect(s), including, without limitation, that portion of any Environmental Assessment prepared by Buyer or its representatives to the extent and only to the extent the same relates to the Environmental Defect Property, and (v) Buyer's estimated cost to Remediate the alleged Environmental Defect (the “Environmental Defect Value”). 5.5Seller's Right to Remediate.  Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at its sole cost, to Remediate at any time prior to Closing any Environmental Defects of which it has been advised by Buyer prior to the Defect Notice Date.5.6Environmental Defect Adjustments.  Upon delivery of a timely Environmental Defect Notice, the Parties shall proceed as follows:(a)With respect to each Environmental Defect asserted by Buyer on or before the Defect Notice Date, Seller may elect, in its sole discretion, on or before the date that is two (2) days prior to Closing, to:(1)reach agreement with Buyer on the existence and scope of the Environmental Defect and subject to Section 5.6(b), adjust the Purchase Price by the Environmental Defect Value of the Environmental Defect Property (the “Environmental Defect Adjustment”), whereupon Seller shall convey the Environmental Defect Property to Buyer at Closing and Buyer shall thereafter assume all liability for Remediation of the Environmental Defect Property;(2)if the Environmental Defect Value exceeds the Allocated Value of the Environmental Defect Property, then Seller may elect to remove the Environmental Defect Property from the Transaction and reduce the Purchase Price by the Allocated Value of the Environmental Defect Property, in which event such Environmental Defect Property shall constitute an Excluded Asset; or (3)challenge the existence and/or scope of the Environmental Defect and/or Environmental Defect Value asserted by Buyer pursuant to Section 5.7.  If Seller elects to challenge the existence of an Environmental Defect and/or Environmental Defect Value and such dispute has not been resolved as of Closing, at Closing Buyer shall pay an amount equal to the claimed Environmental Defect Value into the Escrow Account, such amount to be released to Buyer or Seller based on the joint instructions of the Parties.  If the Environmental Defect Value of any Asset, as finally determined, exceeds the Allocated Value of such Asset, either Seller or Buyer may elect to remove the Asset from the Transaction and reduce the Purchase Price by the Allocated Value of such Asset, in which event such Environmental Defect Property shall constitute an Excluded Asset.(b)There shall be no reduction to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller for any Environmental Defect unless the Environmental Defect Values of all Environmental Defects in the aggregate (excluding any Environmental Defects Remediated by Seller), plus the Title Defect Amounts of all Title Defects in the aggregate, exceed the Aggregate Deductible, after which point Buyer shall be entitled to adjustments to the Purchase Price and remedies only with respect to such Environmental Defects in excess of the Aggregate Deductible.(c)Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, if the Environmental Defect Value exceeds the Allocated Value of any Environmental Defect Property, then Buyer may at any time prior to Closing elect to remove such Environmental Defect Property from the Transaction and, subject to application of the Aggregate Deductible, 14reduce the Purchase Price by the Allocated Value of such Environmental Defect Property, in which event such Environmental Defect Property shall constitute an Excluded Asset.5.7Contested Environmental Defects.

(a)Communication Between the Parties Regarding Breach.  If Buyer develops information during its Due Diligence Review that leads Buyer to believe that Seller has materially breached a representation or warranty under this Agreement, Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to inform Seller in writing of such material breach as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event, at or prior to Closing.  If any Party believes the other Party has materially breached any term of this Agreement, the Party who believes the breach has occurred shall promptly give written notice to the breaching Party of the nature of the breach.(b)Announcements.  For a period of three (3) months following the date of this Agreement, Seller and Buyer shall consult with each other with regard to all press releases and other announcements concerning this Agreement or the Transaction, allowing a reasonable period of time for comment by the other Party; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prevent either Party from timely complying with any applicable securities laws or stock exchange rules.  Neither Party shall be named in any press release or announcement of the other Party without such Party's prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. (c)Casualty Loss.  Prior to Closing, if a portion of the Assets is destroyed by fire or other casualty or if a portion of the Assets is taken or threatened to be taken in condemnation or under the right of eminent domain (“Casualty Loss”), and the resulting loss from such Casualty Loss exceeds two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000) based on the Allocated Value of the affected Assets, Buyer shall not be obligated to purchase such Asset.  If Buyer declines to purchase such Asset, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such Asset.  If Buyer elects to purchase such Asset, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the estimated cost to repair such Asset (with equipment of similar utility), less all insurance proceeds which shall be payable to Buyer, up to the Allocated Value thereof (the reduction being the “Net Casualty Loss”).  Seller, at its sole option, may elect to cure such Casualty Loss and, in such event, Seller shall be entitled to all insurance proceeds.  If Seller elects to cure such Casualty Loss, Seller may replace any personal property that is the subject of a Casualty Loss with equipment of similar grade and utility, or replace any real property with real property of similar nature and kind if such property is reasonably acceptable to 22Buyer.  If Seller elects to cure the Casualty Loss, and the Casualty Loss is cured to Buyer's reasonable satisfaction, Buyer shall purchase the affected Asset at Closing for the Allocated Value thereof.(d)Written Instructions.  Seller and Buyer covenant and agree that when a Party becomes entitled to any distribution from the Escrow Account, the Parties shall within five (5) Business Days execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent joint written instructions setting forth the amounts to be paid to such Party, if any, from the Escrow Account in accordance with this Agreement.
