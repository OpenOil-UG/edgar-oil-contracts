ARTICLE I  PARTICIPANTS
 The executive officers of the Company who participate in the Plan shall be notified by a Grant Notice, which shall contain the number of time-based

(a)
Any embezzlement or wrongful diversion of funds of the Company or any Affiliate by the Participant. 
 


 
(b)

following written notice from the Company or the Board or a committee thereof to the Participant of such alleged failure, which written notice describes in reasonable detail the nature of such alleged failure.

2.5
For the purposes of these Restricted Stock Grant Terms, a Change in Control shall be defined, in accordance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the Code), as the occurrence of any of the following events:   


 
(a)
If any one person, or more than one person acting as a group (as defined in Code Section 409A and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) guidance issued thereunder),
acquires ownership of common stock of the Company that, together with stock held by such person or group, constitutes more than fifty (50) percent of the total fair market value or total voting power of the common stock of the Company. However,
if any one person or more than one person acting as a group, is considered to own more than fifty (50) percent of the total fair market value or total voting power of the common stock of the Company, the acquisition of additional stock by the
same person or persons is not considered to cause a Change in Control, or to cause a change in the effective control of the Company (within the meaning of Code Section 409A and IRS guidance issued thereunder). An increase in the percentage of
common stock owned by any one person, or persons acting as a group, as a result of a transaction in which the Company acquires its stock in exchange for property shall be treated as an acquisition of stock for purposes of this Section. This
paragraph applies only when there is a transfer of stock of the Company (or issuance of stock of the Company) and stock in such Company remains outstanding after the transaction; 
 


 
(b)
If any one person, or more than one person acting as a group (as determined in accordance with Code Section 409A and IRS guidance thereunder), acquires (or has acquired
during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or persons) ownership of common stock of the Company possessing thirty (30) percent or more of the total voting power of the common stock of the
Company;   


 
(c)
 If a majority of members on the Board is replaced during any 12- month period by directors whose appointment or election is not endorsed by a majority of the
members of the Board prior to the date of the 
   3 









 

appointment or election (provided that for purposes of this paragraph, the term Company refers solely to the relevant Company, as defined in Code Section 409A and IRS guidance issued
thereunder), for which no other company is a majority shareholder; or   


 
(d)
If there is a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the Companys assets, which shall occur on the date that any one person, or more than one person acting as
a group (within the meaning of Code Section 409A and IRS guidance issued thereunder) acquires (or has acquired during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or persons) assets from the Company that
have a total gross fair market value equal to or more than forty (40) percent of the total gross fair market value of all of the assets of the Company immediately prior to such acquisition or acquisitions. For this purpose, gross fair market
value means the value of the assets of the Company, or the value of the assets being disposed of, determined without regard to any liabilities associated with such assets. 
For purposes of these Restricted Stock Grant Terms, in the event there is any ambiguity about whether a Change in Control has occurred, the
Committee shall make such determination.

(a)
A material breach by the Company of any agreement between the Participant and the Company that remains uncured for a period of at least sixty (60) days following written
notice by Employee to the Company of the breach. 
   4

A material change in reporting location not agreed to by the Participant.

3.2
Time-Based Vesting. One-third of the grant of Restricted Stock made as of the Effective Date shall be time-based vested only. 
 


 
(a)
Time-Based Vesting of Time-Based Restricted Stock. Each Participant must be employed on December 31, 2013 to vest in the time-based amounts of Restricted Stock
described in this Section 3.2. If a Participant terminates employment or the Participants employment is terminated prior to December 31, 2013 for reasons of Cause, resignation or other voluntary termination other than for Good
Reason, the Participant shall forfeit all of his or her time-based Restricted Stock.   


 
(b)
 Treatment of Vesting of Time-Based Restricted Stock Upon Certain Early Termination Events Not Involving a Change in Control. Notwithstanding the
provisions of Section 3.2 (a) and except as otherwise provided in Section 3.2(c) and (d) below, any Participant who terminates employment prior to December 31, 2013 for reasons of death, Participants

   5 









 

being of or attaining Retirement Age, Disability or termination for Good Reason, or whose employment is terminated by the Company for reasons other than Cause (but excluding resignation or other
voluntary termination by the Participant other than for Good Reason) shall have the unvested portion of his or her time-based Restricted Stock vest pro rata for each full month worked between the Effective Date and the date of termination. For
example, if a Participants employment terminates or is terminated on July 1, 2012 for one of the reasons set forth above in this Section 3.2(b), such Participants vested time-based Restricted Stock shall be 9/27 of the amount
of time-based Restricted Stock granted.   


 
(c)
Participants Whose Employment is Terminated in Connection With a Change in Control Prior to December 31, 2013. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 3.2(a) and
3.2(b) above, any Participant whose employment is terminated prior to December 31, 2013 in connection with a Change in Control or after a Change of Control for Good Reason shall be 100% vested in his or her time-based Restricted Stock as of the
date of the Change in Control or termination for Good Reason, as the case may be.   


 
(d)
Participants Whose Employment is Not Terminated in Connection With a Change in Control Prior to December 31, 2013 and Common Stock is No Longer Outstanding.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 3.2(a) and 3.2(b) above, if a Change in Control occurs prior to December 31, 2013, the Companys Common Stock does not remain outstanding following such Change in Control and the
Participants employment is not terminated in connection with the Change in Control, the Participant shall have the vested portion of his or her time-based Restricted Stock vested pro rata for each full month worked between the Effective Date
and the date of the Change in Control.   


3.3
Performance-Based Vesting. Two-thirds of the grant of Restricted Stock made as of the Effective Date shall be subject both to performance-based vesting requirements and
time-based vesting requirements as set forth in this Section 3.3.   


 
(a)
Performance Vesting. Each Participants performance vesting percentage shall be determined after the close of the year ended December 31, 2013, by reference to
the Implied Net Asset Value Annual Cumulative Percentage Increase from December 31, 2010 through December 31, 2013 and the corresponding vesting percentage set forth in the grid below. Any increase that does not equal a specified
percentage shall be rounded down. For example, an Implied Net Asset Value Annual Cumulative Percentage Increase during the performance period of 18% shall result in 40% of the Restricted Stock vesting if the time-based vesting requirements also are
met.

thereafter terminates employment prior to December 31, 2013 due to attainment of Retirement Age, the Participant shall have the vested portion of his or her performance-based Restricted Stock determined by the factors on the performance vesting

previous sentence, the Company shall withhold Common Stock for Federal and state income tax purposes, as required by law.

the Company or of any Affiliates.

   8 






 ARTICLE VI  MISCELLANEOUS   


7.1
Restricted Stock Not Transferable. No unvested Restricted Stock held by a Participant shall be subject to disposition by transfer, alienation, anticipation, pledge,
encumbrance, assignment, or any other means, whether such disposition is voluntary or involuntary, or by operation of law by judgment, levy, attachment, garnishment or any other legal or equitable proceedings, including bankruptcy. Any attempted
disposition of unvested Restricted Stock shall be null and void and of no effect.   


7.2
Not a Contract of Employment. Nothing in the Grant Notice or in the Restricted Stock Grant Terms shall confer upon the Participant any right to continue in the employ of
the Company or any of its Affiliates or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Company or its Affiliates, which are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge the Participant at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without
cause, except as may otherwise be provided by any written agreement entered into by and between the Company and the Participant.   


7.3
Powers and Duties of the Committee. The Committee has the duty to administer this Plan to the best of its ability. The Committee has all powers necessary to administer
this Plan in all particulars provided, and in all ways reasonably implied, by this Restricted Stock Grant Terms document. The Committee shall have the discretion to interpret a grant, including all matters involving eligibility and benefits, and all
matters involving the intent of the Company in offering a grant under these Restricted Stock Grant Terms. The Committee shall make the determination of the Implied Net Asset Value of the Company for performance-based Restricted Stock vesting
purposes, and the Committee shall make the final determination regarding the Implied Net Asset Value Annual Cumulative Percentage Increase for performance-based Restricted Stock vesting purposes. The Committee in its sole discretion may modify or
amend the definition of Implied Net Asset Value to reflect changes in circumstances of the Company occurring after the Effective Date or to clarify the intent of the Committee. 
 


7.4
Governing Law. The provisions of these Restricted Stock Grant Terms shall be construed and interpreted according to the laws of the State of Colorado, except as preempted
by Federal law.   


7.5
Amendment, Suspension and Termination. Any grant made hereunder may be wholly or partially amended or otherwise modified, suspended or terminated at any time or from time
to time by the Committee or the Board, provided that the amendment, suspension or termination of the grant shall not, without the consent of the Participant, alter or impair any rights or obligations already accrued under the grant. Notwithstanding
the previous sentence, any modification or amendment by the Committee of the definition of Implied Net Asset Value pursuant to Section 7.3 shall not be deemed to alter or impair rights or obligations already accrued under the grant, and the
Committee or the Board may amend the 2007 Plan, the grant or these restricted Stock Grant Terms at any time, and as it deems necessary, in order to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 
   9 









7.6
Code Section 280G and Section 4999 Provisions. In the event that the benefits provided hereunder, together with other payments to a Participant in connection
with a Change in Control (Change in Control Benefits), constitute parachute payments within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, and but for this Section 7.6 would be subject to the excise tax imposed by
Section 4999 of the Code, then the benefits provided hereunder will be either: (i) delivered in full, or (ii) delivered as to such lesser extent that would result in no portion of such benefits being subject to excise tax under
Section 4999 of the Code, whichever of the foregoing amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state and local income taxes and the excise tax imposed by Section 4999, results in the receipt by the Participant on an after-tax
basis, of the greatest amount of Change in Control Benefits, notwithstanding that all or some portion of such Change in Control Benefits may be taxable under Section 4999 of the Code; provided, however, that the Participant may elect to receive
Change in Control Benefits that would result in no portion of such Change in Control Benefits being subject to excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code even if such payment would not result in the greatest amount of Change in Control Benefits
to the Participant. Unless the Company and the Participant otherwise agree in writing, any determination required under this Section 7.6 will be made in writing by the Companys independent public accountants immediately prior to the
Change in Control (the Accountants), whose determination will be conclusive and binding upon the Participant and the Company for all purposes. For purposes of making the calculations required by this Section, the Accountants may make
reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes and may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. The Company and the Participant will furnish to the
Accountants such information and documents as the Accountants may reasonably request in order to make a determination under this Section. The Company will bear all costs the Accountants may reasonably incur in connection with any calculations
contemplated by this Section. In the event the Accountants determine that this Section requires a reduction in the Participants Change in Control Benefits, the Participant will be provided the reasonable opportunity to determine the order in
which Change in Control Benefits will be reduced. If the Participant fails to make an appropriate reduction election within the reasonable time period determined by the Committee, or the Board if no Committee exists, in its sole discretion, the
order of reduction will be determined by the Committee or the Board, if applicable.
