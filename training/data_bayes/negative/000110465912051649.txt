Section 3.                                            Assignment, New Lenders and Reallocation of Commitments and Loans.  The Lenders have agreed among themselves, in consultation with the Borrower, to reallocate their respective Maximum Credit Amounts and to, among other things, allow each Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, New York Agency, Branch Banking and Trust Company and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. to become a party to the Credit Agreement as a Lender, (the New Lenders) by acquiring an interest in the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amount.  The Administrative Agent and the Borrower hereby consent to such reallocation and the New Lenders acquisition of an interest in the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amount and the other Lenders assignments of their Maximum Credit Amounts.  On the First Amendment Effective Date and after giving effect to such reallocations, the Maximum Credit Amount of each Lender shall be as set forth on Annex I of this First Amendment which Annex I supersedes and replaces the Annex I to the Credit Agreement.  With respect to such reallocation, the New Lenders shall be deemed to have acquired the Maximum Credit Amount allocated to it from each of the other Lenders pursuant to the terms of the Assignment and Assumption Agreement attached as Exhibit F to the Credit Agreement as if the New Lenders and the other Lenders had executed an Assignment and Assumption Agreement with respect to such allocation.  On the First Amendment Effective Date, the Borrower shall prepay any Loans outstanding (and pay any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 5.02) to the extent necessary to keep the outstanding Loans ratable with any revised allocations arising from any increase in the Maximum Credit Amounts under this Section.

4.3                                 No Default shall have occurred and be continuing as of the date hereof, after giving effect to the terms of this First Amendment.
 
4.4                                 The Administrative Agent shall have received such other documents as the Administrative Agent or its special counsel may reasonably require.

5.4                                 NO ORAL AGREEMENT. THIS FIRST AMENDMENT, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS EXECUTED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH AND THEREWITH REPRESENT THE FINAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS, OR UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES.
