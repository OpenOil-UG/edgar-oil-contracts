RECITALS
 
WHEREAS, Range owns certain oil and gas leases located in Walker and Grimes Counties, Texas;
 
WHEREAS, Range desires to assign to ZaZa, and ZaZa desires to accept assignment from Range of a certain interest in the Leases (defined below) upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement; and
 
WHEREAS, Range and ZaZa also desire to enter into an exploration effort under the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement and the JOA (defined below).
 
NOW THEREFORE, the Parties agree as follows:
 
1.0                               Leases
 
1.1                               Range is the owner and holder of certain oil and gas Leases covering approximately 61,123 gross acres and 37,837 Net Acres (defined below), more or less, located in Walker and Grimes Counties, Texas (and certain associated assets), described on Exhibit A attached hereto and made a part hereof (the Leases).
 
1.2                               Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Range will assign, transfer, convey and deliver to ZaZa and ZaZa will acquire an undivided Seventy-five percent (75%) Working Interest (defined below) and no less than a Seventy-five percent (75%) Net Revenue Interest in and to the Leases (the Interest).  In exchange for the Interest, ZaZa will pay to Range the cash consideration specified in Paragraph 2.0, and, as additional consideration, ZaZa will drill one test well or conduct a re-entry in the manner provided for in Paragraph 3.0.  Range will reserve a 25% Working Interest and an overriding royalty equal to the positive arithmetical difference, between Twenty-five percent of eight-eighths (25% of 8/8ths) and the existing burdens or outstanding interests in the Leases, on all oil and gas produced and saved from or allocated to the Leases. The Working Interests and the overriding royalty interests reserved by Range shall be proportionately reduced in the event the Parties collective interest as a result of the ownership of the Leases is less than 100% of the fee mineral estate.

(d)                                 Title Defect means any matter that would cause the title to the Leases to fail to qualify as Good and Defensible Title (including, without limitation, a discrepancy in the Interest or the Net Acres).
 
(e)                                  Allocated Value means, with respect to each Lease, the amount set forth on Exhibit A under the column styled Allocated Value for such Lease (equal to $300.00 per Net Acre).
 
2.3                               Notice of Title Defect.  During the period immediately following the date the last Party executes this Agreement (Execution Date) and ending thirty (30) calendar days thereafter (the Due Diligence Period), ZaZa may review title to the Leases and may notify Range in writing (the Title Defect Notice) of any Title Defect.  Any notice provided hereunder shall include a description of the Title Defect, the portion of the Lease affected by the Title Defect and the Allocated Value of the Title Defect (the Defect Value).

2.5                               Procedure for Resolving Title Defects.  With respect to Title Defects properly and timely asserted by ZaZa as provided herein, the following procedures shall apply.
 
(a)                                 If Range contests the existence of a Title Defect or the Defect Value, Range shall so notify ZaZa in writing on or before five (5) calendar days after Ranges receipt of the Title Defect Notice (Rejection Notice).  The Rejection Notice shall state with reasonable specificity the basis of Ranges rejection of the Title Defect or the Defect Value.  No later than five (5) calendar days following ZaZas receipt of the Rejection Notice, representatives of ZaZa and Range, knowledgeable in title matters, shall meet and endeavor in good faith to either: (i) agree to mutually reject the particular Title Defect, or (ii) agree on the validity of such Title Defect and the Defect Value, in which case Range may cure such Title Defect at its own expense and to ZaZas reasonable satisfaction and, failing such cure, make a title defect payment (Title Defect Payment) equivalent to
 
5






 
the outstanding Defect Value.  If the Parties cannot agree on either option (i) or (ii) in the preceding sentence, the Title Defect or the Defect Value subject to the Rejection Notice shall be submitted to dispute resolution in accordance with the procedures set forth in Paragraph 2.8.
 
(b)                                 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) an individual claim for a Title Defect for which a valid Title Defect Notice is given shall only generate an obligation for a Title Defect Reduction or Title Defect Payment if the Defect Value with respect thereto exceeds $5,000.00 (ii) the aggregate Defect Values attributable to all Title Defects shall not exceed the Allocated Value of such Leases, and (iii) there shall be no Title Defect Payment unless and until the aggregate Defect Values that are entitled to an adjustment hereunder, and for which Title Defect Notices were timely delivered, exceed $50,000.00 (the Title Deductible).
 
(c)                                  In the event that, within one hundred twenty (120) calendar days after the end of the Due Diligence Period, Range is able to cure at its expense and to ZaZas reasonable satisfaction any Title Defect with respect to which an adjustment to the Consideration was made without excluding the Lease affected thereby from the Interest in the Leases conveyed by the Assignment, ZaZa shall pay the amount of such adjustment to Range within one hundred fifty (150) calendar days after the Due Diligence Period.
 
2.6                               Value of Defects.  The Defect Value for a Title Defect shall be determined as follows:
 
(a)                                 If, because of the Title Defect, title to a particular Lease fails completely with the effect that ZaZa has no ownership interest in the relevant Lease, the Defect Value shall be the Allocated Value of that Lease.
 
(b)                                 If the Title Defect consists of a an unpermitted lien, encumbrance or other charge upon the Lease, which is liquidated in amount, the Defect Value shall be the amount necessary to pay the obligee to remove such Title Defect.
 
(c)                                  If ZaZas actual Net Revenue Interest in a Lease is less than the 75% Net Revenue Interest set forth for in Paragraph 1.2 for such Lease, the Defect Value shall be an amount equal to (i) the ratio of (x) the difference obtained by subtracting the actual Net Revenue Interest for such Lease from the 75% Net Revenue Interest set forth in Paragraph 1.2 for such Lease to (y) the 75% Net Revenue Interest set forth for such Lease in Paragraph 1.2 (ii) multiplied by the Allocated Value for such Lease.
 
(d)                                 If the Title Defect is one other than described in subparagraphs 2.6(a) through 2.6(c), the Defect Value shall be the commercially reasonable amount determined by mutual agreement of the Parties.
 
6






 
2.7                               Right to Terminate Agreement.  In the event the sum of the values attributed to Title Defects equals or exceeds 30 % of the Consideration, and Range elects not to cure or is unable to cure such Title Defects, ZaZa may elect to terminate this Agreement without liability to Range, in which case ZaZa shall be entitled to a refund of the Consideration.
 
2.8                               Expert Determination.
 
(a)                                 If Range and ZaZa are unable to agree, as herein provided, regarding the existence of a Title Defect or the applicable Defect Value, the Parties shall promptly refer the matter for determination in the manner hereinafter provided to an independent qualified expert selected by mutual agreement of the Parties who possesses the requisite knowledge, skill and experience to determine the issue in question (the Defect Expert).  The Defect Expert may enlist the advice of attorneys, geologists, and landmen mutually agreed upon by the Parties and any other neutral expert as it deems reasonably necessary.
 
(b)                                 Upon referral to the Defect Expert, the Parties shall each deliver to the other Party and the Defect Expert a notice setting forth in adequate detail the issues to be determined by the Defect Expert and the decision (on a word-for-word basis) that such Party wishes the Defect Expert to make with respect to the issues to be determined (the Decision Notice); provided, however, that in preparing their Decision Notice, each Party (as well as the Defect Expert) shall be bound by the terms of this Agreement.  Within two (2) business days after the giving of the two Decision Notices, the Parties shall attend a meeting with the Defect Expert at a mutually acceptable time and place to discuss fully the content of such Decision Notice and, based thereon, determine whether either or both wish to modify their Decision Notices in any way.  Any such modifications shall be discussed, so that when each Party finalizes its Decision Notice, it shall do so with full knowledge of the content of the other Partys final Decision Notice.  The finalization of such Decision Notices and the delivery of same by each Party to the other shall occur at the meeting unless the Parties agree to have one or more additional meetings for such purposes.  The Defect Expert shall be required to adopt the decision set forth in either final Decision Notice and shall have no power whatsoever to reach any other result.  Such Defect Expert shall adopt the decision that, in his or her judgment, is the more fair and equitable decision and in conformity with this Agreement and consistent with prevailing industry standards.
 
(c)                                  The decision, made in writing and signed by the Defect Expert, shall determine such dispute.  Such decision shall be made, signed and delivered to the Parties at the meeting unless otherwise agreed by the Parties.  The expenses of the Defect Expert and any other expert retained by the Defect Expert under this Agreement shall be borne equally by the
 
7






 
Parties, except that each Party shall bear the compensation and expense of its own counsel, witnesses and employees.  The determination and award of the Defect Expert shall be final and binding upon the Parties, and judgment may be entered thereon in any court of competent jurisdiction upon the application of either Party.
 
2.9                               Definitions.  For purposes of this Agreement, the following expressions and terms will have the meanings set forth hereinafter:
 
(a)                                 Applicable Laws means all laws, statutes, treaties, rules, codes, ordinances, regulations, certificates, orders, interpretations, licenses and permits of any Governmental Body, including the common or civil law and all judgments, decrees, injunctions, writs, orders, or like action of any court, arbitrator, or other Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction; and
 
(b)                                 Governmental Body means any federal, state, provincial, municipal, tribal, county, parish, or other federal, state or local governmental authority or judicial or regulatory agency, board, body, department, bureau, commission, instrumentality, court, tribunal or quasi-governmental authority in any jurisdiction (domestic or foreign).
 
3.0                               Designation of Operator, Drilling and Completion of Commitment Well, Substitute Well and Subsequent Wells, and Penalties
 
3.1                               On or before July 1, 2012, ZaZa, as the designated operator of the Leases and new leases jointly acquired by the Parties within the AMI, shall commence operations to 1) re-enter the Gibbs Brothers 1H (API 42-471-30348) located in the M. Herrera Survey A-25, Walker County, Texas; OR 2) drill and complete a well at a mutually agreeable location on lands covered solely by the Leases which location shall be proposed by ZaZa to Range and Ranges approval of such well shall not be unreasonably withheld (the Commitment Well).  The Commitment Well shall be re-entered and/or drilled with reasonable diligence and prudence in a good faith attempt to reach a depth sufficient to test the Eagle Ford Pepper Shale Formation, the stratigraphic equivalent of said formation may been seen on the Array Induction Compensated Neutron Litho-Density log of the Anadarko Tanqueray Unit #1 Well (API# 42-471-30293) located in the Jose Sanchez Survey A-46, Walker County, Texas at a depth of 12,230 to 12,375 feet (Minimum Required Depth), unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties.  The Commitment Well shall be drilled to include a pilot hole sufficient to log the entire interval and provide logs that are permissible pursuant to the terms of the relevant Lease and all reasonably available well data on Exhibit C; required logs shall only include the: a) Platform Express Triple Combo (AIT/CNL-FDC/PE), and b) Dipole Sonic/Sonic Scanner (subject only to the obtainment of a Lease depth extension from the respective lessor reasonably sufficient to allow the operator to conduct the logging operations in compliance with the depth restrictions contained in the  relevant Lease); and, although not explicitly required to reach the Earning Point, ZaZa shall exercise its reasonable best efforts, subject to hole conditions, tool availability and the obtainment of a Lease depth extension from the respective lessor reasonably sufficient to allow the operator to conduct the logging operations in compliance with the depth restrictions
 
8






 
contained in the relevant Lease, to also obtain c) Elemental Capture (ECS), d) Dual Oil-Base Micro Imager, and e) 50 Rotary Sidewalls.  The Commitment Well shall be drilled and completed as a Horizontal Well that meets the definition of a horizontal drainhole well under Statewide Rule 86 of the Railroad Commission of Texas, with a horizontal section being no less than 4000 (Minimum Required Lateral Length), unless material technological or mechanical issues are experienced after commencement of drilling that prevent drilling to a lateral length of 4000.  If, prior to reaching the Minimum Required Depth or the Minimum Required Lateral Length, the Commitment Well must be abandoned due to mechanical difficulties, waterflow, loss of circulation, excessive pressure, cavities, caprock, salt or salt dome material, heaving shale or other practically impenetrable conditions which would, in the opinion of a reasonably prudent operator, render further drilling impractical, then ZaZa may, but not later than sixty (60) calendar days after the release of the rig from the Commitment Well, at its option commence the drilling of a substitute for the Commitment Well in a bona fide effort to reach the Minimum Required Depth and Minimum Required Lateral Length (the Substitute Well), and such Substitute Well shall, for all purposes, be considered the Commitment Well.  Failure to commence the Commitment Well will result in the remedy provided in Paragraph 3.4.
 
3.2                               (a) The actual costs of drilling the Commitment Well, or Substitute Well shall be disproportionally borne 100% by ZaZa up to and until ZaZa has drilled, completed, installed all facilities reasonably necessary to produce oil and/or gas from said well, and actually initiated sales of oil and/or gas on the Commitment Well and/or Substitute Well (the Earning Point).  Upon reaching the Earning Point, (i) the disproportionate spend shall cease, (ii) ZaZa will retain all its Interest, and (iii) the participating Parties shall share all actual costs in proportion to the Parties Working Interest.
 
(b) The actual costs of operations by participating Parties after the Earning Point shall be borne 75.00% by ZaZa and 25.00% by Range.
 
(c) Subject to Paragraph 3.2 (a), any proposal after the Earning Point to drill a well on the Leases that is not a Commitment Well, or Substitute Well, shall be drilled on a non-promoted basis and drilled pursuant to the terms of the JOA described in Paragraph 6.1 below.
 
3.3                               As to the Commitment Well, or Substitute Well, any title opinions, supplemental title opinions and curative expenses or costs associated therewith that are incurred by ZaZa, as operator, prior to the Earning Point, shall be paid 100% by ZaZa.  Any such costs incurred after the Earning Point shall be borne by the participating Parties in proportion to their interest, 75.00% by ZaZa and 25.00% by Range.
 
3.4                               It is understood that if ZaZa fails to commence operations on the Commitment Well on or before July 1, 2012 or, if the Earning Point has not yet been reached and a Substitute Well has not been commenced in a timely manner as provided by Paragraph 3.1, or if the Earning Point has not been reached by November 1, 2012, then ZaZa shall assign or re-assign to Range an undivided 25% interest in the Leases using an assignment with ZaZa as assignor and Range as assignee substantively identical to the form of assignment attached as Exhibit B, and will execute any and all documents reasonably required to transfer to Range the status of operator of the Leases.  Any proposal to drill a well on the Leases after July 1, 2012 that is not a Substitute Well, shall be drilled on a non-promoted basis and drilled pursuant to the terms of the
 
9






 
JOA described in Paragraph 6.1 below.
 
4.0                               Terms of Ranges Carried Working Interest
 
4.1                               Range, its successors and assigns, will have a 25.00% carried working interest through up to the Earning Point in the Commitment Well, or Substitute Well(s), drilled in the Stayin Alive Area detailed in the attached Exhibit F.  Ranges carried working interest shall be free of all costs and expenses whatsoever incurred prior to the Earning Point in the Commitment Well, or Substitute Well(s).
 
The carried working interest reserved by Range shall be proportionately reduced in the event the Parties interest in the Leases is less than 100% of the fee mineral estate in the a Commitment Well or Substitute Well.  If the Commitment Well or Substitute Well includes acreage in which Range owns less than 100% of the fee mineral estate interest and Range is subject to proportionate reduction, then Range shall participate in subsequent wells with a Carried Working Interest being the equivalent of 100% less Ranges interest in the Commitment Well or Substitute Well, and subsequent wells, until the Earning Point has been reached.
 
5.0                               Area of Mutual Interest
 
(a)                                 The Parties hereby establish an Area of Mutual Interest (AMI). The AMI shall be those lands shown on the plat attached hereto as Exhibit D. Unless sooner terminated by mutual agreement of the Parties hereto, the designated AMI shall remain in full force and effect for a period of three (3) years from the Effective Date hereof, at which time it shall terminate and dissolve without any further action by the Parties hereto. Any Party acquiring (the Acquiring Party) any leasehold interests or contractual right to earn leasehold interests, mineral interests, royalty interests, rights under farmout or farmin agreements, production payments, net profits interests, and any other interest in the oil, gas, condensate, and casinghead gas in, on or under the lands within the AMI during the term above stated shall offer such interest(s) and shall furnish the other Parties with the following information: (a) copies of the documents reflecting the rights to such interests, (b) instruments sufficient to verify the actual consideration paid or agreed to for the acquisition of such interest (including, without limitation, any drilling obligations), (c) a plat or exact description of the location of the interest, and (d) any other documents pertinent to the other Party evaluating the Acquiring Partys interest; provided, however, that (i) no Party shall be required to offer to the other Party any interest or right to acquire an interest in the AMI pursuant to a merger, consolidation, reorganization or share acquisition; (ii) ZaZa will have no obligation to offer to Range any leases or legal or equitable or contractual interest therein, including, without limitation, any unexercised lease options, letters of intent, or other contractual arrangements within the AMI which ZaZa has an interest in, either directly or indirectly, or is a party to, on or before the Execution Date; or (iii) any undivided interest acquired by ZaZa after the Execution Date in a lease within the AMI held by ZaZa, or
 
10







 
for the account of ZaZa, prior to the Execution Date (e.g. if ZaZa holds 30% of 8/8ths in a lease on or before the Execution Date and later acquires the remaining 70% of 8/8ths, the entire 8/8ths shall not be subject to the AMI).  Each non-acquiring Party (Non-Acquiring Party) shall have thirty (30) calendar days following receipt of such notice in which to indicate its election to participate in said acquisition by written response delivered to the Acquiring Party accompanied by good funds covering its share of the acquisition costs.  Failure of the Non-Acquiring Party, after receipt of such notice, to timely respond to the Acquiring Party within the above specified period of time shall constitute an election by the Non-Acquiring Party not to participate in such acquisition.  In the event all of the Parties hereto elect to acquire their proportionate share of any acquisition hereunder, then the lands covered thereby shall become subject to the JOA.  Any interest not taken shall be retained by the Acquiring Party.  Sales or transfers of a Lease, or an interest which has previously been offered under this Paragraph 5.0, are not required to be offered to the other Party.  In the event a part of the consideration concerning the cost of an acquisition within the AMI requires the drilling of a well or the acquisition of 3-D data prior to earning an assignment of a leasehold interest, for purposes of this Paragraph 5.0 it shall be considered that such leasehold interest has been acquired and the offer shall be made as soon as the agreement to acquire the same has been executed.  If the acquisition is an option or similar agreement in which the acquiring party has paid for the optional right to acquire a leasehold interest in the future, and if the Party to whom the interest is offered elects not to participate in acquisition of the option, it shall have no right to participate in any leasehold interest thereafter acquired by exercise of the option.
 
(b)                                 In the event a lease (or other interest) lies partially within and partially outside of the AMI, then the offer required to be made under this Paragraph 5.0 shall incorporate the entirety of the lease and, if the non-acquiring Party participates in the acquisition of the lease (or other interest), then the outside boundaries of the AMI shall be expanded to include the entirety of the lease (or other interest) acquired.
 
(c)                                  Any interests and/or rights offered under this Paragraph 5.0 shall be offered to the Parties as to their respective interests as reflected in Paragraph 3.2(b) above.
 
6.0                               Joint Operating Agreement
 
6.1          The Parties will execute a joint operating agreement (JOA) substantively identical in form to the one attached hereto as Exhibit E with its contract area being identical to all of the lands subject to the Leases on Exhibit A.  The JOA shall name ZaZa as initial operator.  In the event of a conflict between the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the JOA, the terms of this Agreement shall control.  The presence of a term governing conduct in the JOA and the absence of a term governing the same conduct in this Agreement shall not constitute a
