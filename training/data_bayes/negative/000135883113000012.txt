Each capitalized term which is defined in the Credit Agreement, but which is not defined in this Fifth Amendment, shall have the meaning ascribed such term in the Credit Agreement.  Unless otherwise indicated, all section references in this Fifth Amendment refer to sections of the Credit Agreement.  Section 2.    Amendments to Credit Agreement. 2.1    Amendment to Section 1.02.    The definition of “Agreement” is hereby amended in its entirety to read as follows:“Agreement” means this Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, as amended by the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, the Third Amendment, the Fourth Amendment and the Fifth Amendment, as the same may from time to time be amended, modified, supplemented or restated.2.2    Amendment to Section 9.02(f).    Section 9.02(f) is hereby amended by deleting the reference to “$500,000,000” and replacing such reference with “$750,000,000”.Page 12.3    Amendments to Section 9.05.        Section 9.05 is hereby amended as follows:(a)    Section 9.05(g) is hereby amended by deleting the reference to “$4,000,000” and replacing such reference with “$20,000,000”.(b)    Section 9.05(h) is hereby amended by deleting the reference to “$4,000,000” and replacing such reference with “$20,000,000”.Section 3.    Limited Waiver.    The Borrower has informed the Administrative Agent and the Lenders that it intends to issue Senior Notes in reliance upon Section 9.02(f) in an aggregate principal amount of up to a maximum of $400,000,000 on or about May 16, 2013 (the “Senior Notes Issuance”).  Upon the Senior Notes Issuance, the Borrower will prepay a portion of the Borrowings then outstanding (the “Prepayment”) with net cash proceeds received from the Senior Notes Issuance.  The Prepayment will cause the aggregate notional amount of Swap Agreements entered into by the Borrower in respect of interest rates to exceed 100% of the outstanding principal amount of the Borrower's Debt for borrowed money which bears interest at a floating rate, in violation of Section 9.18(b) (the “Interest Rate Hedging Covenant”).  Based on the foregoing, the Borrower has requested that the Lenders waive, and the Lenders do hereby waive the Borrower's compliance with the Interest Rate Hedging Covenant so as to permit Swap Agreements which have been entered into by the Borrower in respect of interest rates prior to the date hereof and that are outstanding and in effect on the date hereof (the “Existing Hedges”) to remain outstanding in accordance with their terms; provided that the Borrower shall not extend or increase the notional amount of its Existing Hedges expiring in 2013; however, the Borrower shall be permitted to extend its Existing Hedges expiring in 2014 and 2015 even if at the time of such extension the notional amount of Swap Agreements entered into by the Borrower in respect of interest rates exceed 100% of the outstanding principal amount of the Borrower's Debt for borrowed money which bears interest at a floating rate.Except as expressly waived herein, all covenants, obligations and agreements of the Borrower contained in the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.  Without limitation of the foregoing, the foregoing waiver is hereby granted to the extent and only to the extent specifically stated herein and for no other purpose and shall not be deemed to (a) be a consent or agreement to, or waiver or modification of, or amendment to, any other term or condition of the Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document or any of the documents referred to therein, (b) except as expressly set forth herein, prejudice any right or rights which the Administrative Agent or the Lenders may now have or may have in the future under or in connection with the Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document or any of the documents referred to therein, or (c) constitute any course of dealing or other basis for altering any obligation of the Borrower or any right, privilege or remedy of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders under the Credit Agreement, the other Loan Documents, or any other contract or instrument.  Granting the waiver set forth herein does not and should not be construed to be an assurance or promise that consents or waivers will be granted in the future, whether for the matters herein stated or on other unrelated matters.
