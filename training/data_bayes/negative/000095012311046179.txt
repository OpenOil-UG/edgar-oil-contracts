approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors then comprising the
Incumbent Board shall be considered for purposes of this definition as though such
individual was a member of the Incumbent Board, but excluding, for these purposes, any
such individual whose initial assumption of office as a director occurs as a result of
an actual or threatened election contest with respect to the election or removal of
directors or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on
behalf of any individual, entity or group other than the Board.
