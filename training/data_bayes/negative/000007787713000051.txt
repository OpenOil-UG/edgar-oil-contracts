The purchase price for the Assets shall be two hundred fifteen million dollars ($215,000,000.00) (the “Initial Purchase Price”), subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement (as adjusted, the “Purchase Price”).  The Purchase Price shall be payable as follows:(a)    Upon execution hereof, PDC, Caerus Operating and JPMorgan Chase (the “Escrow Agent”) shall enter into the escrow agreement (the “Escrow Agreement”) in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit F and Caerus Operating shall deposit into an escrow account (“Escrow Account”), on or within one (1) business day after the date of this Agreement, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to fifteen million dollars ($15,000,000.00) (the “Deposit”).  The Deposit and accrued interest thereon shall be applied to the Closing Amount at Closing.  Upon any termination of this Agreement, the Deposit and accrued interest thereon shall be paid to PDC or returned to Caerus Operating in accordance with Article 11.  Escrow fees charged by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement shall be paid one-half by PDC and one-half by Caerus Operating.(b)    After Closing, final adjustments to the Purchase Price shall be made pursuant to (i) the Final Settlement Statement to be delivered pursuant to Section 13.1 and payments made by Buyer or Seller as provided in Section 13.1 and (ii) Articles 4 and 5.2.2    Allocation of the Purchase Price.  The Initial Purchase Price is allocated among the Assets as set forth on Schedule 2.2, which amounts shall be referred to as the “Allocated Value.”2.3    Adjustments to Purchase Price and Preliminary Settlement.  The Purchase Price shall be adjusted according to this Section 2.3 without duplication.  Seller shall deliver to Buyer at least three (3) business days prior to Closing a draft settlement statement (“Preliminary Settlement Statement”) that shall set forth the adjusted Purchase Price reflecting each adjustment in accordance with this Agreement as of the date of preparation of such Preliminary Settlement Statement.  The Preliminary Settlement Statement will be used to adjust the Initial Purchase Price at Closing, which adjusted amount is referred to herein as the “Closing Amount.” (a)    Proration of Costs and Revenues.  Buyer shall be entitled to all production of Hydrocarbons from or attributable to the Leases, Lands and Wells (“Properties”) at and after the Effective Time (and all products and proceeds attributable thereto), and to all other income, proceeds, receipts and credits earned with respect to the Assets at or after the Effective Time, and shall be responsible for (and entitled to any refunds with respect to) all Property Expenses (as defined in Section 2.3(b) below) incurred at and after the Effective Time.  Seller shall be entitled to all Hydrocarbon production from or attributable to the Properties prior to the Effective Time (and all products and proceeds attributable thereto), and to all other income, proceeds, receipts and credits earned with respect to the Assets prior to the Effective Time, and shall be responsible for (and entitled to any refunds with respect to) all Property Expenses incurred prior to the Effective Time.  The terms “earned” and “incurred”, as used in this Agreement shall be interpreted in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied.  For purposes of allocating production (and accounts receivable with respect thereto), under this Section 2.3(a), (i) liquid Hydrocarbons, including natural gas liquids, shall be deemed to be “from or attributable to” the Properties when they pass through the pipeline connecting into the storage facilities into which they are run or into tanks connected to the Wells and (ii) gaseous Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be “from or attributable to” the Properties when they pass through the royalty measurement meters, delivery point sales meters or custody transfer meters on the gathering lines or pipelines through which they are transported (whichever meter is closest to the well).  Seller shall utilize reasonable interpolative procedures, consistent with industry practice, to arrive at an allocation of production when exact meter readings or gauging and strapping data are not available.  As part of the Preliminary Settlement Statement, Seller shall provide to Buyer all data necessary to support any estimated allocation, for purposes of establishing the Closing Amount.(b)    Property Expenses.  The term “Property Expenses” means all capital expenses (including all capital expenditures authorized by Section 8.1(a)) and operating expenses incurred in the ownership, development and operation of the Assets in the ordinary course of business and, where applicable, in accordance with any relevant operating agreement, if any, and all Lease rental and maintenance costs, net profit payments, royalties, overriding royalties and other similar burdens incurred in connection with the Leases or the production and sale of Hydrocarbons therefrom, but excluding Production Taxes (which shall be apportioned as of the Effective Time in accordance with Article 9) and Income Taxes.  “Property Expenses” shall include overhead for the period between the Effective Time and the Closing Date equal to an aggregate two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.00) per month, prorated for any portion of a month, which amounts shall be in lieu of any overhead payable by Buyer to Seller for operations during such period pursuant to any operating agreement; provided that any payment of any overhead fee, partnership pumping fee or other similar proceeds received by Seller from any third party pursuant to any operating agreement during such period, shall be considered proceeds earned with respect to the Assets for purposes of Section 2.3(a).(c)    Upward Adjustments.  To calculate the Closing Amount, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted upward by the following:(1)    The aggregate amount of the following proceeds actually received by Buyer: (i) proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons (net of any royalties, overriding royalties or other burdens on or payable out of Hydrocarbon production, gathering, processing and transportation costs not reimbursed to Buyer by the purchaser of Hydrocarbon production) produced from or attributable to the Properties for periods prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) other proceeds earned with respect to the Assets for periods prior to the Effective Time;(2)    The amount of all Property Expenses and other costs (other than Production Taxes and Income Taxes) attributable to the ownership and operation of the Assets for the period after the Effective Time which are actually paid by Seller plus any overhead costs under Section 2.3(a) deemed charged to the Assets with respect to the Adjustment Period even though not actually paid, except any Property Expenses and other such costs already deducted in the determination of proceeds in Section 2.3(c)(1);(3)    An amount equal to the value of (i) all oil and other Hydrocarbons in pipelines or flowlines or in tanks above the pipeline sales connection (exclusive of any brine, sludge or water that may be present in the oil storage tanks), in each case that at the Effective Time, estimated based on run tickets as of the Effective Time, is credited to Seller’s interest in the Properties and (ii) all unsold inventory of gas plant products attributable to Seller’s interests in the Properties at the Effective Time, each such value to be the contract price in effect as of the Effective Time or, in the absence of an applicable contract price, the average price per unit for sales of production for the respective production period attributable to the Properties as of the Effective Time, less any applicable royalties;(4)    If the net of the pipeline imbalances set forth on Schedule 6.9 is an overdelivery imbalance (that is, at the Effective Time, Seller has delivered more gas to the pipeline than the pipeline has redelivered for Seller), the Purchase Price shall be adjusted upward by the first-of-the-month price of spot gas delivered to pipelines for Colorado Interstate Gas Company (Rocky Mountains) as reported in Inside F.E.R.C.’s Gas Market Report for the month in which the Effective Time occurs times the net overdelivery imbalance in MMbtus.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following shall not be considered Title Defects:(1)    defects based solely on lack of information in Seller’s files;(2)    defects in the chain of title consisting of the mere failure to recite marital status in a document unless Buyer provides clear and convincing evidence that such failure or omission has resulted in another person’s actual and superior claim of title to the relevant Asset;(3)    defects based on failure to record Leases issued by any state or federal Governmental Entity (but excluding any assignments of such Leases), in the real property, conveyance or other records of the county in which such Property is located; provided that such Lease is recorded in the official records of the applicable Governmental Entity;(4)    defects arising out of lack of survey, unless a survey is expressly required by applicable laws or regulations;(5)    defects arising out of lack of evidence of record of corporate or other entity authority of an appropriate designated officer (but not a power of attorney) unless Buyer provides a reasonable basis for the assertion that such corporate or other entity action was not authorized and results in another person’s actual and superior claim of title to the relevant Asset(6)    defects that have been cured by applicable laws of limitations or prescription; and(7)    defects with respect to Seller’s title to all or any portion of the Water Rights and the NECO Gathering Systems.(b)    Title Benefit.  As used in this Agreement, the term “Title Benefit” shall mean any right, circumstance or condition that operates to (a) increase the Net Revenue Interest being assigned to Buyer in any Lease or Well above that shown for such Lease or Well in Exhibit A or Exhibit B, as applicable, to the extent the same does not cause a greater than proportionate increase in the Working Interest being assigned to Buyer therein above that shown in Exhibit A or Exhibit B, as applicable, or (b) increase the Net Mineral Acres being assigned to Buyer in any Lease to greater than that shown therefor in Exhibit A.  A Title Benefit shall not include any Asset or portion thereof that is excluded from Seller’s Defensible Title representation pursuant to Section 4.2(d).(c)    Notice of Defective Interest.  At or before 5:00 p.m. Mountain Time on the Defect Notice Date, Buyer shall advise Seller in writing of any matters that in Buyer’s opinion constitute a Title Defect with respect to Seller’s title to all or any portion of the Leases, Wells or other Assets (“Notice of Defective Interest”).  The Notice of Defective Interest shall be in writing and contain the following:  (i) a description of the alleged Title Defect(s), (ii) the Leases, Wells or other Assets (and the applicable zone(s) therein) affected by the alleged Title Defect (each a “Title Defect Property”), (iii) the Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property, (iv) supporting documentation reasonably necessary for Seller (as well as any title attorney or examiner hired by Seller) to verify the existence of the alleged Title Defect(s), and (v) the amount by which Buyer believes the Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property is reduced by the alleged Title Defect(s) and the computations and information upon which Buyer’s belief is based.

(d)    Notice of Title Benefits.  At or before 5:00 p.m. Mountain Time on the Defect Notice Date, Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to advise Buyer in writing of any matters that in Seller’s opinion constitute a Title Benefit with respect to Seller’s title to all or any portion of the Leases, Wells or other Assets (a “Title Benefit Notice”).  The Title Benefit Notice shall be in writing and contain the following:  (i) a description of the Title Benefit, (ii) the Leases, Wells or other Assets (and the applicable zone(s) therein) affected by the Title Benefit (“Title Benefit Property”), (iii) the Allocated Values of the Leases, Wells or other Assets (and the applicable zone(s) therein) subject to such Title Benefit, and (iv) the amount by which the Seller believes the Allocated Value of those Leases, Wells or other Assets (and the applicable zone(s) therein) is increased by the Title Benefit, and the computations and information upon which Seller’s belief is based. Seller shall be deemed to have waived all Title Benefits of which it has not given notice on or before the Defect Notice Date.(e)    Seller’s Right to Cure.  Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at its sole cost, to cure or remove at any time prior to the Closing (the “Cure Period”), to Buyer’s reasonable satisfaction, any Title Defects of which it has been advised by Buyer.(f)    Remedies for Title Defects.  Subject to Seller’s continuing right to dispute the existence of a Title Defect or the Title Defect Amount asserted with respect thereto, in the event that any Title Defect timely asserted by Buyer in accordance with Section 4.3(c) actually exists and is not waived by Buyer or cured to Buyer’s reasonable satisfaction on or before the end of the Cure Period, Seller shall convey the Title Defect Property to Buyer at Closing with a reduction to the Purchase Price, provided, however, that Seller shall retain the right to cure such Title Defects after Closing, as set forth herein.  The reduction to the Purchase Price contemplated by the foregoing sentence shall equal the amount of the aggregate Title Defect Amounts for all such Title Defects as determined pursuant to Section 4.3(g), subject to the Individual Title Threshold, the adjustment for certain Title Benefits and the Aggregate Deductible set forth in Section 4.3(i) (as so calculated, the “Title Defect Adjustment”).  Caerus Operating shall deposit an amount equal to the Title Defect Adjustment in the Escrow Account at Closing, which amount shall be released (with accrued interest) to Caerus Operating or PDC in accordance with this Section 4.3(f).  Seller shall have one hundred (100) days after the Closing Date (the “Post-Closing Cure Period”) in which to attempt to cure any such Title Defects to Buyer’s reasonable satisfaction, subject to the continuing application of the Individual Title Threshold and the Aggregate Deductible.  Buyer shall use good faith efforts to cooperate with Seller’s efforts to cure such Title Defects.  If Seller cures any such Title Defect to Buyer’s reasonable satisfaction prior to the end of the Post-Closing Cure Period, then the Title Defect Amount with respect to the Title Defect that is so cured, together with accrued interest, shall promptly be released from the Escrow Account to PDC pursuant to the joint instructions of Caerus Operating and PDC.  If Seller is unable to cure the Title Defect prior to the end of the Post-Closing Cure Period or elects not to cure any such Title Defect, then (i) the Title Defect Amount with respect to the Title Defect that is not cured, together with accrued interest, shall promptly be released from the Escrow Account to Caerus Operating pursuant to the joint instructions of PDC and Caerus Operating, and (ii) if the Title Defect Amount is equal to or greater than the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property, at the request of Seller, the Title Defect Property subject to the Title Defect shall be reconveyed to Seller which shall be deemed to be effective as of the Effective Time.  If the Parties are unable to agree as to whether the Title Defect has been cured to Buyer’s reasonable satisfaction, the provisions of Section 4.4 shall apply as written and the Title Arbitrator shall be selected within fifteen (15) business days following the end of the Post-Closing Cure Period. (g)    Title Defect Amount.  The “Title Defect Amount” means the amount by which the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property affected by such Title Defect is reduced as a result of the existence of such Title Defect and shall be determined in accordance with the following methodology, terms and conditions:(1)    if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Defect Amount, that amount shall be the Title Defect Amount;(2)    if the Title Defect is a lien, encumbrance or other charge which is undisputed and liquidated in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the amount of the payment necessary to remove the Title Defect from the Title Defect Property;(3)    if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (A) the Net Revenue Interest for any Title Defect Property and (B) the Net Revenue Interest stated in Exhibit A or Exhibit B, as applicable, for such Title Defect Property, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Net Revenue Interest decrease and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest stated in Exhibit A or Exhibit B, as applicable; (4)    if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (A) the Net Mineral Acres for any Title Defect Property and (B) the Net Mineral Acres stated on Exhibit A for such Title Defect Property, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Net Mineral Acres decrease and the denominator of which is the Net Mineral Acres stated on Exhibit A; (5)    if the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden or charge upon or other defect in title to the Title Defect Property of a type not described in subsections (1), (2), (3) or (4) above, the Title Defect Amount shall be determined by taking into account the following factors:  (i) any discrepancy between (A) the Net Revenue Interest, Net Mineral Acres or Working Interest for any Title Defect Property and (B) the Net Revenue Interest, Net Mineral Acres or Working Interest stated in Exhibit A or Exhibit B, as applicable; (ii) the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property; (iii) the portion of the Title Defect Property affected by the Title Defect; (iv) the legal effect of the Title Defect; (v) the values placed upon the Title Defect by Buyer and Seller; and (vi) such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation; and(6)    if the Title Defect represents a failure of Seller to have Defensible Title to an Asset other than a Lease or Well, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the reasonable cost to replace such Asset.Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 4, the aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title Defects upon any Title Defect Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property.  (h)    Title Benefit Amount.  “Title Benefit Amount” means the amount by which the Allocated Value of the Title Benefit Property affected by such Title Benefit is increased as a result of the existence of such Title Benefit and shall be determined in accordance with the following methodology, terms and conditions:(1)    if Buyer and Seller agree on the amount of the Title Benefit, that amount shall be the Title Benefit Amount;(2)    if the Title Benefit represents an increase between (A) the Net Revenue Interest or Net Mineral Acres for any Title Benefit Property and (B) the Net Revenue Interest set forth in Exhibit A or Exhibit B, or Net Mineral Acres set forth in Exhibit A, as applicable, for such Title Benefit Property, then the Title Benefit Amount shall be an amount equal to the product of the Allocated Value of such Title Benefit Property multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Net Revenue Interest or Net Acres increase, and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest set forth in Exhibit A or Exhibit B or Net Mineral Acres set forth in Exhibit A for such Title Benefit Property, as applicable; (3)    if the Title Benefit is of a type not described above, then the applicable Title Benefit Amount shall be determined by taking into account the following factors:  (i) any discrepancy between (A) the Net Revenue Interest, Net Mineral Acres or Working Interest for any Title Benefit Property and (B) the Net Revenue Interest, Net Mineral Acres or Working Interest stated in Exhibit A or Exhibit B, as applicable; (ii) the Allocated Value of the Title Benefit Property; (iii) the portion of the Title Benefit Property affected by the Title Benefit; (iv) the legal effect of the Title Benefit; and (v) such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation; and(4)    if a Title Benefit Property has no Allocated Value, then such Title Benefit Property shall have no Title Benefit Amount.  (i)    Title Thresholds and Deductibles.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (i) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller for any individual Title Defect for which the Title Defect Amount does not exceed fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) (“Individual Title Threshold”); and (ii) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller for any Title Defect that exceeds the Individual Title Threshold unless the aggregate Title Defect Amounts of all Title Defects that exceed the Individual Title Threshold (excluding any Title Defects cured by Seller) less the aggregate Title Benefit Amounts of all individual Title Benefits for which the Title Benefit Amount exceeds fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), when taken together with the aggregate Environmental Defect Values, exceed three and one-quarter percent (3.25%) of the Initial Purchase Price (“Aggregate Deductible”), after which point Buyer shall be entitled to adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies only with respect to such Title Defects and Environmental Defects in excess of such Aggregate Deductible. 4.4    Title Dispute Resolution.  The Parties agree to resolve disputes concerning the following matters pursuant to this Section 4.4:  (i) the existence and scope of a Title Defect or Title Benefit, (ii) the Title Defect Amount or Title Benefit Amount, as the case may be, relating to the portion of the Asset affected by a Title Defect or Title Benefit and (iii) the adequacy of Seller’s Title Defect curative materials and Buyer’s reasonable satisfaction thereof (the “Title Disputed Matters”).  The Parties agree to attempt to initially resolve all disputes through good faith negotiations.  All Title Disputed Matters that are unresolved by the Parties shall be exclusively and finally resolved by arbitration pursuant to this Section 4.4.  There shall be a single arbitrator, who shall be (i) a title attorney with at least ten (10) years experience in oil and gas titles involving properties in the regional area in which the Lease and Lands are located (“Title Arbitrator”), as selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller within fifteen (15) business days after the end of the Cure Period, and absent such mutual agreement, by the Denver, Colorado office of the American Arbitration Association.  The arbitration proceeding shall be held in Denver, Colorado and shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this Section 4.4.  The Title Arbitrator’s determination shall be made within fifteen (15) business days after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding upon both Parties, without right of appeal.  In making his or her determination, the Title Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in this Article 4 and may consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Title Arbitrator are necessary or helpful to make a proper determination.  Additionally, the Title Arbitrator may consult with and engage disinterested third parties to advise the expert or arbitrator, including petroleum engineers.  The Title Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the Title Disputed Matters submitted by either Party and may not award damages, interest or penalties to either Party with respect to any matter.  Each Party may submit only one Title Defect Amount with respect to each alleged Title Defect and one Title Benefit Amount with respect to each Title Benefit (provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to preclude a Party from also arguing against, and the Title Arbitrator determining, the existence of a Title Defect or a Title Benefit).  Seller and Buyer shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case.  Each Party shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Title Arbitrator, including any costs incurred by the Title Arbitrator that are attributable to such third party consultation.  Within ten (10) days after the Title Arbitrator delivers written notice to Buyer and Seller of the award with respect to a Title Disputed Matter, PDC and Caerus Operating shall issue joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to release to PDC or Caerus Operating the amount, if any, awarded by the Title Arbitrator to such Party, plus the interest accrued on such amount.4.5    Preferential Rights and Consents.  The remedies set forth in this Section 4.5 are the exclusive remedies under this Agreement for consents to assign and preferential rights to purchase listed on Schedules 4.5(a) and 4.5(b).(a)    Consents.  All required consents to assignment that are necessary for Seller to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement are set forth on Schedule 4.5(a)(i) (the “Required Consents”). Seller shall use reasonable efforts to obtain all Required Consents prior to Closing.  Consents and approvals which are customarily obtained post-Closing shall not be considered Required Consents.  If prior to Closing, Seller fails to obtain the Required Consents set forth on Schedule 4.5(a)(ii) (the “Specified Consents”) that would invalidate the conveyance of the Asset affected by the consent to assign or materially affect the value or use of the Asset (“Affected Asset”), then Seller shall retain the Affected Asset and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of the Affected Asset.  Seller, with Buyer’s assistance, shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain such Specified Consent as promptly as possible following Closing.  If such Specified Consent has been obtained as of the Final Settlement Date, Seller shall convey the Affected Asset to Buyer effective as of the Effective Time and Buyer shall pay Seller the Allocated Value of the Affected Asset, less any proceeds from the Affected Asset attributable to the period of time after the Effective Time received and retained by Seller (net of any Property Expenses paid by Seller attributable to such period).  If such Specified Consent has not been obtained as of the Final Settlement Date, the Affected Asset shall be excluded from the sale and the Purchase Price shall be deemed to be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of the Affected Asset.  If prior to May 31, 2013, Seller fails to obtain the Required Consents set forth on Schedule 4.5(a)(iii) then either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 11.1(g).  Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with Seller in obtaining any Required Consent including providing assurances of reasonable financial conditions, but Buyer shall not be required to expend funds or make any other type of financial commitments in order to obtain such consent.(b)    Preferential Purchase Rights.  All preferential rights relating to the sale of any of the Assets are set forth on Schedule 4.5(b).  Prior to Closing, Seller shall use reasonable good faith efforts to give notices required in connection with such preferential purchase rights together with any other preferential rights to purchase discovered by Buyer prior to Closing.  If any preferential right to purchase any portion of the Assets is exercised prior to Closing, then that portion of the Assets affected by such preferential purchase right shall be excluded from the Assets and the Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such affected Assets.  If by Closing, either (i) the time frame for the exercise of a preferential purchase right has not expired and Seller has not received notice of an intent not to exercise or a waiver of the preferential purchase right, or (ii) a third party exercises its preferential right to purchase, but the time frame for the consummation of such preferential purchase right has not expired prior to the Closing, then Seller shall retain the affected Assets and the Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such affected Assets.  As to any Assets retained by Seller hereunder, following Closing if a preferential right to purchase is not consummated within the time frame specified in the preferential purchase right, or if the time frame for exercise of the preferential purchase right expired without exercise after the Closing, Seller shall promptly convey the affected Asset to Buyer effective as of the Effective Time, and Buyer shall pay the Allocated Value thereof pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, less any proceeds from such affected Asset attributable to the period of time after the Effective Time received and retained by Seller (net of any Property Expenses paid by Seller attributable to such period).ARTICLE 5ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS5.1    Definitions.  For the purposes of the Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings: (a)    “Condition” means any circumstance, occurrence, act, omission, status or defect that requires Remediation to comply with, or to discharge any liabilities incurred pursuant to, Environmental Laws.(b)    “Environmental Defect” means a Condition in, on, under or relating to a particular Asset (including any impacts to air, land, soil, surface and subsurface strata, surface water, groundwater, or sediments) that causes a particular Asset to be in violation of, or subject to any Remediation obligations under, any Environmental Law, if the estimated cost (using the most cost effective remedy consistent with prudent industry practices) of Remediation of that particular Asset alone exceeds fifty thousand dollars ($50,000).  For purposes of this Definition, and by way of example only, each individual Well, common tank battery or a common separation facility shall be considered a separate Asset.  If a Condition exists at more than one Asset, the costs of Remediation to address that Condition shall be fairly apportioned between the affected Assets, and in order to qualify as an Environmental Defect, such apportioned costs must exceed the $50,000 threshold as applied to each particular Asset alone, provided that Remediation costs for separate Conditions that affect the same Asset shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the $50,000 threshold has been met for that Asset.(c)    “Environmental Law” or “Environmental Laws” shall mean, as of the date of this Agreement, any federal, state or local law (including the common law), statute, rule, regulation, requirement, ordinance and any writ, decree, bond, authorization, approval, license, permit, registration, binding criteria, standard, consent decree, settlement agreement, judgment, order, directive or binding policy issued by or entered into with a Governmental Entity pertaining or relating to:  (a) pollution or pollution control, including air emissions and stormwater discharge; (b) protection of human health from exposure to Hazardous Materials or protection of the environment; or (c) the management, presence, use, generation, processing, extraction, treatment, recycling, refining, reclamation, labeling, transport, storage, collection, distribution, disposal or release or threat of release of Hazardous Materials.  “Environmental Laws” shall include, without limitation, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. § 9601 et seq. (“CERCLA”), the Solid Waste Disposal Act (as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act), 42 U.S.C. § 6901 et seq., the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act, 49 U.S.C. § 1801 et seq., the Toxic Substances Control Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2601 et seq., the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq., the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 300f-300, the Federal Air Pollution Control Act, 42 U.S.C. § 7401 et seq., the Oil Pollution Act, 33 U.S.C. § 2701 et seq., the Endangered Species Act, and the regulations and orders respectively promulgated thereunder, each as amended, or any equivalent or analogous state or local statutes, laws or ordinances, any regulation promulgated thereunder and any amendments thereto.(d)    “Governmental Entity” means any national, state or local government or any subdivision, agency, court, commission, department, board, bureau, regulatory authority or other division or instrumentality thereof.(e)    “Hazardous Materials” shall mean, without limitation, any waste, substance, product, or other material (whether solid, liquid, gas or mixed), which is or becomes identified, listed, published, or defined as a hazardous substance, hazardous waste, hazardous material, toxic substance, or radioactive material, including Hydrocarbons, oil, or petroleum waste, or any other waste, pollutant or contaminant, that is regulated or restricted under any Environmental Law.(f)    “Remediation” or “Remediate” means any investigation, assessment, characterization, delineation, monitoring, sampling, analysis, removal action, remedial action, response action, corrective action, mitigation, treatment or cleanup of Hazardous Materials, any reporting, permitting, registration, notification, plan development or implementation, pollution control equipment installation or operation, or any other similar corrective or remedial or compliance actions required by any applicable Environmental Laws or otherwise for the general protection of human health and the environment.5.2    Environmental Liabilities and Obligations.  Upon Closing, Buyer agrees to assume and pay, perform, fulfill and discharge all claims, costs, expenses, liabilities and obligations accruing or relating to, and release Seller, its stockholders, directors, officers, employees, advisors, agents and representatives, and their respective successors and assigns from all Losses (including any civil fines and penalties, costs of Remediation and expenses for the modification, repair or replacement of facilities on the Lands brought or assessed by any and all persons, including any Governmental Entity, as a result of any damage to, or destruction or loss of, property, and any damage to natural resources (including soil, air, surface water or groundwater)), to the extent any of the foregoing directly or indirectly is caused by, relates to, or otherwise involves any Condition associated with the Assets, regardless of whether any such Condition was created or is attributable to periods either before or after the Effective Time, including the presence, disposal or release of any Hazardous Material of any kind in, on or under the Assets or the Lands, but excluding any such Losses resulting from Seller’s gross negligence or willful misconduct (collectively, “Buyer’s Environmental Liabilities”).5.3    NORM.  Buyer acknowledges that the Assets have been used for the exploration, development, and production of Hydrocarbons.  Equipment and sites included in the Assets may contain naturally occurring radioactive material (“NORM”).  NORM may affix or attach itself to the inside of wells, materials, and equipment as scale, or in other forms.  The wells, materials, and equipment located on the Properties or included in the Assets may contain NORM.  NORM may have come in contact with various environmental media, including water, soils or sediment.  Special procedures may be required for the assessment, remediation, removal, transportation, or disposal of NORM from the Assets.5.4    Environmental Defect Notice.  On or before the Defect Notice Date, Buyer shall give Seller written notice of any Environmental Defects as to which Buyer has knowledge prior to the Defect Notice Date.  Buyer shall be deemed to have waived its right to assert an Environmental Defect if Buyer does not include such Environmental Defect in an Environmental Defect Notice delivered to Seller on or before the Defect Notice Date.  An Environmental Defect Notice shall contain the following: (i) a description of the Condition in, on, under or relating to the Asset that causes the alleged Environmental Defect; (ii) a description of the particular Asset affected by the alleged Environmental Defect (each an “Environmental Defect Property”); (iii) the Allocated Value of each Environmental Defect Property; (iv) supporting documentation reasonably necessary for Seller (as well as any consultant hired by Seller) to verify the existence of the alleged Environmental Defect(s), and (v) Buyer’s estimated cost to Remediate the alleged Environmental Defect and supporting documentation reasonably necessary to verify such estimate (the “Environmental Defect Value”). 5.5    Seller’s Right to Remediate.  Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at its sole cost, to Remediate at any time prior to Closing any Environmental Defects of which it has been advised by Buyer prior to the Defect Notice Date.5.6    Defect Adjustments.  Upon delivery of a timely Environmental Defect Notice, the Parties shall proceed as follows:(a)    With respect to each Environmental Defect asserted by Buyer on or before the Defect Notice Date, Seller may elect, in its sole discretion, on or before the date that is three (3) days prior to Closing to:(1)    reach agreement with Buyer on the existence of the Environmental Defect and adjust the Purchase Price by the Environmental Defect Value of the Environmental Defect Property subject to application of the Aggregate Deductible with respect to the aggregate Title Defects and Environmental Defects (the “Environmental Defect Adjustment”), whereupon Seller shall convey the Environmental Defect Property to Buyer at Closing and Buyer shall thereafter assume all liability for Remediation of the Environmental Defect Property;(2)    if the Environmental Defect Value exceeds the Allocated Value of the Environmental Defect Property, then Seller may remove the Environmental Defect Property from the Transaction and reduce the Purchase Price by the Allocated Value of the Environmental Defect Property; or (3)    challenge the existence and/or scope of the Environmental Defect and/or Environmental Defect Value asserted by Buyer pursuant to Section 5.7.  If Seller elects to challenge the existence of an Environmental Defect and/or Environmental Defect Value and such dispute has not been resolved as of Closing, at Closing Caerus Operating shall cause to be paid an amount equal to the claimed Environmental Defect Adjustment attributable to such Environmental Defect to the Escrow Agent.  (b)    There shall be no reduction to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller for any Environmental Defect unless the Environmental Defect Values of all Environmental Defects in the aggregate (excluding any Environmental Defects Remediated by Seller), when taken together with the aggregate Title Defect Amounts, exceed the Aggregate Deductible, after which point Buyer shall be entitled to adjustments to the Purchase Price and remedies only with respect to such Environmental Defects in excess of such Aggregate Deductible.5.7    Contested Environmental Defects.  If, pursuant to Section 5.6(a)(3), Seller elects to proceed under this Section 5.7 with respect to an Environmental Defect, the following matters shall be determined pursuant to this Section 5.7: (a) the existence and scope of an Environmental Defect, and (b) the Environmental Defect Value.  The Parties agree to attempt to initially resolve all disputes through good faith negotiations.  If the Parties cannot resolve disputes regarding items (a) or (b) within thirty (30) days after the Defect Notice Date, either Party may submit the dispute to an environmental consultant or other professional approved in writing by Seller and Buyer that is experienced in environmental corrective action at oil and gas properties in the relevant jurisdiction and that shall not have performed professional services for either Party or any of their respective Affiliates during the previous five years (the “Environmental Expert”).  The Environmental Expert shall render its decision within twenty (20) business days after submission of the matters in dispute, which decision shall be final and binding upon both Parties, without right of appeal.  In making his or her determination, the Environmental Expert shall be bound by the rules set forth in this Article 5 and may consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Environmental Expert are necessary or helpful to make a proper determination.  The Environmental Expert shall conduct the dispute resolution proceeding by written submissions from Buyer and Seller with exhibits, supplemented with appearances by Buyer and Seller, if necessary, as the Environmental Expert may deem necessary.  The Environmental Expert shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the disputed Environmental Defect matters submitted by either Party and may not award damages, interest or penalties to either Party with respect to any matter.  Seller and Buyer shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case to the Environmental Expert.  Each Party shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Environmental Expert.5.8    Exclusive Remedies.  Except for any remedies that may be available under this Agreement for breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 6.18, the right of Buyer to reduce the Purchase Price to reflect one or more Environmental Defect Adjustments pursuant to this Article 5 or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1(f) shall be the exclusive right and remedy of Buyer with respect to environmental matters with respect to the Assets.

Seller is designated as operator of certain Assets pursuant to joint operating agreements with third parties.  Buyer acknowledges that such third parties may not agree to allow Buyer to succeed Seller as operator under such joint operating agreements or may otherwise exercise other rights they may have that would preclude Buyer from succeeding Seller as operator.  Buyer specifically acknowledges and agrees that Seller has made no representation or guarantee that Buyer will succeed Seller as operator under any joint operating agreement; provided that Seller shall use commercially reasonably efforts, if requested by Buyer, to support Buyer’s succession of Seller as operator as to any of the Assets currently operated by Seller, subject to the provisions of any applicable joint operating agreement.(d)    Bonds, Letters of Credit and Guarantees.  Buyer acknowledges that none of the bonds, letters of credit and guarantees, if any, posted by Seller or its Affiliates with Governmental Entities or third parties and relating to the Assets are transferable to Buyer.  Except to the extent that Buyer will, as of Closing, be covered by the bonds of the operators of the applicable Assets, then on or before the Closing Date, Buyer shall obtain, or cause to be obtained in the name of Buyer, replacements for such bonds, letters of credit and guarantees, to the extent such replacements are necessary to permit the cancellation as of Closing of the bonds, letters of credit and guarantees posted by Seller and/or its Affiliates.8.3    Employee Matters. (a)    As soon as administratively practicable (but in no event later than ten (10) business days) following the date hereof, Seller shall provide Buyer with a list of full time and part time employees (hourly and salaried) of Seller whose primary employment is related to the Assets (“Business Employees”).  Such list shall include the following information with respect to each Business Employee: (i) employing entity; (ii) job title; (iii) original hire date (and service date, if different); (iv) status as exempt or non-exempt under the Fair Labor Standards Act; (v) current annualized base salary (or hourly base rate of pay) and other compensation (including bonus(es), profit-sharing and other compensation) paid in 2012 or paid or reasonably expected to be paid in 2013; (vi) leave status (including nature and expected duration); (vii) visa status (if applicable); and (viii) details of any outstanding loans or advances made by Seller to such Business Employees.  From and after the date of this Agreement, Seller shall update such list on and through the Closing Date to reflect any new hires or departures of Business Employees.  Prior to the Closing Date, Buyer or one of its Affiliates shall make an offer of employment to each Business Employee, with each such offer to be (i) contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing, (ii) subject to satisfaction of Buyer’s or its applicable Affiliate’s pre-hire requirements and screening processes, (iii) at the same base salary or base hourly wage as was provided to such Business Employees immediately prior to the Closing and with substantially the same benefits and annual bonus opportunities made available to similarly situated employees of Buyer; and (iv) effective as of the time immediately following the Closing (or such later time as any Business Employee who is on any leave of absence or short or long term disability commences active employment with Buyer or one of its Affiliates (provided that such commencement of active employment occurs not later than (x) 90 days following the Closing Date or (y) such later time as may be required by applicable law)).  Seller shall assist Buyer and its Affiliates, as applicable, in communicating with the Business Employees regarding potential employment with Buyer or one of its Affiliates.  Seller shall not interfere with any such employment offers or discourage any Business Employee from accepting employment with Buyer or one of its Affiliates.  (b)    For purposes of this Agreement, a “New Employee” is a Business Employee who accepts an offer of employment made pursuant to Section 8.3(a), satisfies the applicable pre-hire requirements and screening processes and actually becomes employed by Buyer or one of its Affiliates in accordance with such offer.  The date of a New Employee’s commencement of active employment with Buyer or one of its Affiliates is referred to herein as such New Employee’s “Hire Date.”  (c)    With respect to each New Employee and effective as of the time immediately prior to such New Employee’s Hire Date, Seller shall (i) terminate the employment of such New Employee and (ii) waive and release any confidentiality, non-competition, non-disclosure and similar agreements between Seller and such New Employee that would restrict or encumber such New Employee’s ability to perform any of his or her duties as an employee of Buyer or one of its Affiliates.  (d)    Buyer or one of its Affiliates shall take such actions as are necessary to provide each New Employee with credit for the years of service with Seller for purposes of eligibility, vesting, and entitlement to benefits (and for benefit accruals solely with respect to vacation, sick leave, and severance), under all employee benefit plans and all vacation, sick leave, severance, and other compensation plans, policies, agreements and arrangements maintained by Buyer or any of its Affiliates in which such New Employee participates on or after the Closing Date in the same manner as if such service had been service for Buyer or one of its Affiliates completed after the Closing; provided, however, that no prior service credit shall be provided (i) for purposes of any equity-based or other incentive compensation plans or arrangements or (ii) if such credit would result in a duplication of benefits for the same period of service.(e)    Buyer or one of its Affiliates shall take such actions as are necessary to offer medical and dental coverage to New Employees and their spouses and dependents under the group health plan made available to employees of Buyer and its Affiliates (the “Buyer Group Health Plan”).  Buyer or one of its Affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Buyer Group Health Plan, and applicable insurance carriers, third party administrators and any other third parties, to waive any waiting period(s) under the Buyer Group Health Plan otherwise applicable to such New Employees and all limitations as to pre-existing medical conditions under the Buyer Group Health Plan applicable to New Employees who have been continuously covered under a group health plan for the 12-month period immediately preceding their Hire Date.  Buyer or one of its Affiliates shall take such actions as are necessary to provide continuation coverage to New Employees and their qualified beneficiaries who incur qualifying events after the Closing Date in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 4980B of the Code or any state analog (collectively “COBRA”).  Seller shall provide COBRA continuation coverage to all other individuals who are M & A qualified beneficiaries (within the meaning assigned to such term under Q&A-4 of Treasury regulation section 54.4980B-9) with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for the duration of the period to which such individuals are entitled to such coverage.  Seller shall take any and all necessary actions to ensure that Buyer and its Affiliates are not required to provide such continuation coverage to any such individual at any time.  (f)    With respect to each New Employee, Buyer or one of its Affiliates shall take such actions as are necessary to cause New Employees to participate in any incentive bonus programs in which similarly situated employees of Buyer or its applicable Affiliate that employs such New Employee participate.(g)    With respect to events following the Closing, Buyer or one of its Affiliates shall be responsible for sending, if applicable, timely and appropriate notices to all New Employees required under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (“WARN”) and all other similar, applicable laws relating to plant or facility closings or otherwise regulating the termination of employees.  To the extent that any liability is incurred under any such laws to a New Employee based on Buyer’s actions after the Closing, Buyer or one of its Affiliates shall be solely and exclusively responsible for all obligations and liabilities incurred under WARN and other such similar, applicable laws to such New Employee.(h)    Seller shall make available to Buyer records which provide information regarding New Employees’ positions and dates of hire by Seller and that contain such information as is necessary for Buyer and its Affiliates to meet their obligations under this Section 8.3.  Without limiting the foregoing sentence, to the extent permitted by applicable law, Seller shall, as soon as practicable following the date hereof, provide Buyer and its Affiliates with all employee benefit plan participation information and other related access and data as may be reasonably required by Buyer and its Affiliates to implement the provisions of this Section 8.3 and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enable Buyer and its Affiliates to solicit benefit plan elections from the New Employees sufficiently in advance of each New Employee’s Hire Date to permit the implementation of such elections as of such New Employee’s Hire Date.(i)    Following the Closing, to the extent permitted by applicable law, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be accepted by the trustee of a tax qualified retirement plan maintained by Buyer or one of its Affiliates in which a New Employee is eligible to participate (the “Buyer Retirement Plan”) a “direct rollover” pursuant to Section 401(a)(31) of the Code of all or a portion of any eligible rollover distribution (within the meaning of Section 402(c) of the Code) of such New Employee’s account balance (including participant loans) under the The PDC Energy, Inc. 401(k) & Profit Sharing Plan (the “Seller Retirement Plan”), provided that Seller (i) provides to Buyer such information as is satisfactory to Buyer to assure itself that the Seller Retirement Plan satisfies the qualification requirements of Section 401(a) of the Code and (ii) causes the Seller Retirement Plan to provide to Buyer or one of its Affiliates the promissory notes and other loan documentation, if any, of the New Employees who have elected such a direct rollover. The Buyer Retirement Plan shall accept the direct rollover of electing New Employees’ benefits in cash and, if applicable, promissory notes that are not accelerated from the Seller Retirement Plan; provided that any such direct rollover shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Buyer Retirement Plan in effect from time to time applicable to rollover contributions and participant loans.  Seller represents, covenants and agrees with respect to the Seller Retirement Plan, and Buyer represents, covenants and agrees with respect to the Buyer Retirement Plan, that, as of each date of a rollover described in this Section 8.3(i), the Seller Retirement Plan or the Buyer Retirement Plan, as applicable, is intended to satisfy the requirements of Sections 401(a), (k), and (m) of the Code.(j)    Each Party agrees that, for a period of twelve (12) months following Closing, it will not (and will cause its Affiliates not to), in any manner, directly or indirectly, solicit any person who is an employee of the other Party or any Affiliate of such other Party (other than any Business Employee) to terminate his or her employment with such other Party or any of its Affiliates or apply for or accept employment with the soliciting Party, any of its Affiliates or any other business entity.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, it shall not constitute a violation of this Section 8.3 for a Party or any of its Affiliates to (A) make a general solicitation for employment or other services through any form of media or any third party recruiting firm not specifically directed to the employees, agents or consultants of the other Party or any of its Affiliates and hire any person that responds to the same, or (B) solicit or hire any person who has ceased to be employed by the other Party or any of its Affiliates prior to commencement of employment discussions between the soliciting or hiring Party or any of its Affiliates and such person.  (k)    The provisions of this Section 8.3 are solely for the benefit of the Parties and nothing in this Section 8.3, express or implied, shall confer upon any Business Employee, or legal representative or beneficiary thereof, any rights or remedies, including any right to employment or continued employment for any specified period, or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever under this Agreement.  Nothing in this Section 8.3, express or implied, shall be (i) deemed an amendment of any employee benefit plan providing benefits to any Business Employee, or (ii) construed to prevent Buyer or any of its Affiliates from terminating or modifying to any extent or in any respect any employee benefit plan that Buyer or any of its Affiliates may establish or maintain.8.4    Covenants and Agreements of the Parties.(a)    Communication Between the Parties Regarding Breach.  If Buyer develops information during its Due Diligence Review that leads Buyer to believe that Seller has breached a representation or warranty under this Agreement, Buyer shall inform Seller in writing of such potential breach as soon as practicable, but in any event, at or prior to Closing.  If any Party believes the other Party has breached any term of this Agreement, the Party who believes the breach has occurred shall promptly give written notice to the breaching Party of the nature of the breach.(b)    Announcements.  Prior to the Closing Date, Seller and Buyer shall consult with each other with regard to all press releases and other announcements concerning this Agreement or the Transaction, allowing a reasonable period of time for comment by the other Party; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prevent either Party from timely complying with any applicable securities laws or stock exchange rules.  Except as provided above, prior to the Closing Date, neither Party shall be named in any press release or announcement of the other Party without such Party’s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.(c)    Casualty Loss.  Prior to Closing, if a portion of the Assets is destroyed by fire or other casualty or if a portion of the Assets is taken or threatened to be taken in condemnation or under the right of eminent domain (“Casualty Loss”), and the resulting loss from such Casualty Loss exceeds two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000) based on the Allocated Value of the affected Assets, then the following shall occur.  Prior to Closing, Seller, at its sole option and expense, may elect to cure a Casualty Loss with respect to affected personal property by replacing any such personal property with personal property of similar grade or utility that is reasonably acceptable to Buyer.  If prior to Closing the Casualty Loss is cured to Buyer’s reasonable satisfaction, Buyer shall purchase the affected Asset at Closing for the Allocated Value thereof and Seller shall be entitled to all insurance proceeds with respect thereto. If a Casualty Loss is not cured to Buyer’s reasonable satisfaction prior to Closing, then Buyer may (i) decline to purchase such Asset, in which event the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such Asset; or (ii) elect to purchase such Asset, in which event the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the estimated cost to repair such Asset (with equipment of similar grade or utility that is reasonably acceptable to Buyer) up to the Allocated Value thereof (the reduction being the “Net Casualty Loss”).  (d)    Written Instructions.  PDC and Caerus Operating covenant and agree that when a Party becomes entitled to any distribution from the Escrow Account, PDC and Caerus Operating shall within five (5) business days execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent joint written instructions setting forth the amounts to be paid to such Party, if any, from the Escrow Account in accordance with this Agreement.(e)    Records.  Seller shall make the Records available for pick-up by Buyer at Closing to the extent possible, but in any event, within sixty (60) days after Closing.  Seller may retain copies of the Records and Seller shall have the right to review and copy the Records during standard business hours upon reasonable notice for so long as Buyer retains the Records.  Buyer agrees that the Records will be maintained in compliance with all applicable laws governing document retention.  Seller shall be entitled to keep a copy or copies of all Records; provided, however, that Seller shall not sell or otherwise allow third parties to review, copy or otherwise use (for any purpose) any Records retained by Seller for their own account.(f)    Transfer of Hedging Transactions.  At Closing, Seller shall transfer to, or novate in favor of, Caerus Operating, the hedging transactions listed on Schedule 8.4(f) which cover a portion of production from the Assets (the “Hedging Transactions”).  Whether or not the Closing occurs, Caerus Operating shall pay and be responsible for any out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Seller related to transferring to, or novating in favor of, Caerus Operating the Hedging Transactions, and, to the extent not provided for in the Final Settlement Statement, shall make any required payments to Seller within ten (10) business days after receipt of an invoice with respect thereto.  From and after the date hereof through the Closing, the Parties will cooperate and take all reasonable actions necessary to obtain any consents required for the novation or transfer of the Hedging Transactions to Caerus Operating at Closing.(g)    Garden Gulch.  At or prior to the Closing and to the extent requested by the successor operator to the Garden Gulch Road, PDC, as the sole member and manager of Garden Gulch, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company (“Garden Gulch”), shall transfer the limited liability company membership interests in Garden Gulch or cause Garden Gulch to transfer any and all contracts or agreements of Garden Gulch relating to operation and maintenance of the Garden Gulch Road to such successor operator.(h)    Further Assurances.  From time to time after Closing, Seller, Caerus Operating and Buyer shall each execute, acknowledge and deliver to the other such further instruments and take such other action as may be reasonably requested in order to accomplish more effectively the purposes of the Transaction, including assurances that Seller and Buyer are financially capable of performing any indemnification required hereunder.ARTICLE 9TAX MATTERS9.1    Definitions.

Property Taxes that are based on or measured by the production of Hydrocarbons (“Oil and Gas Property Taxes”) shall be deemed attributable to the period during which the production giving rise to the Property Taxes occurs, and liability therefor allocated to Seller for pre-Effective Time Oil and Gas Property Taxes and to Buyer for post-Effective Time Oil and Gas Property Taxes.  For the purpose of calculating the Closing Amount under Section 2.3 and the Final Purchase Price under Section 13.1, Oil and Gas Property Taxes determined by 2011 and 2012 production (and payable in 2013 and 2014, respectively) shall be estimated based on the then-current mill levies and the production occurring prior to the Effective Date with the resulting Purchase Price adjustment under Section 13.1 to be considered full and final settlement of all such Oil and Gas Property Taxes without regard to the actual Tax rates or assessments; provided that, if the actual amounts of such production and mill levies are not known at the time of the Closing, the amounts shall be re-estimated based on the best information available at the time of the Final Settlement Statement, and such estimated amounts shall thereupon become full and final settlement of such Oil and Gas Property Taxes (the “Settled Oil and Gas Property Taxes”) for purposes of this Agreement.(b)    Property Taxes other than those described in clause (a) (“Other Property Taxes”) shall be deemed attributable to the period during which ownership of the applicable Assets gives rise to liability for such Other Property Taxes, and liability therefor allocated to Seller for all periods ending prior to the Effective Time and to Buyer for all periods beginning on or after the Effective Time.  For the avoidance of doubt, Kansas ad valorem Taxes with respect to the Assets shall be treated as an Other Property Tax.  To the extent the actual amount of an Other Property Tax that is attributable to a period ending prior to the Effective Time (but not due and payable prior to the Closing) is not determinable at the time an adjustment to the Purchase Price is to be made with respect to such Other Property Tax pursuant to Section 2.3 and/or Section 13.1, as applicable, the Parties shall utilize the most recent information available in estimating the amount of such Other Property Tax for purposes of such adjustment, and the amount of such Other Property Tax used for purposes of Section 13.1 shall be considered full and final settlement of such Other Property Tax without regard to the actual Tax rates or assessments (the “Settled Other Property Taxes,” and together with the Settled Oil and Gas Property Taxes, the “Settled Property Taxes”).(c)    Buyer shall be entitled to all rights to any refunds of (i) Property Taxes allocable to Buyer pursuant to this Section 9.2 regardless of when received, and (ii) Settled Property Taxes.  Seller shall be entitled to all rights to any refunds of Property Taxes allocated to Seller pursuant to this Section 9.2 other than refunds of Settled Property Taxes.  After Closing, Buyer shall timely file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for Property Taxes required to be filed after the Closing and shall timely pay or cause to be paid to the taxing authorities all Property Taxes that become due and payable after the Closing. Any penalty, addition to Tax, or interest levied or assessed with respect to any Property Tax shall be allocated to, and shall be payable by, the Party to which the Tax to which such penalty, addition to Tax or interest relates is allocated, regardless of when such penalty, addition to Tax, or interest is levied or assessed; provided, however, that the liability for any penalty, addition to Tax, or interest levied or assessed with respect to any failure of Buyer to comply with the previous sentence shall be allocated to, and shall be payable by, Buyer.9.3    Apportionment of Severance Taxes.  Severance Taxes shall be deemed attributable to the period during which the production of the Hydrocarbons with respect to such Severance Taxes occurred, and liability therefor shall be allocated to Seller for pre-Effective Time Severance Taxes and to Buyer for post-Effective Time Severance Taxes.  For the purpose of calculating the Closing Amount under Section 2.3 and the Final Purchase Price under Section 13.1, Severance Taxes for which the actual liability amount is not known as of such time shall be estimated based on current Colorado or Kansas Severance Tax rates, as applicable, with the resulting Purchase Price adjustment under Section 13.1 to be considered full and final settlement of all such Taxes without regard to the actual Tax rates or assessments; provided that, if the actual amounts of the applicable Severance Tax rates are not known at the time of the Closing, the amounts shall be re-estimated based on the best information available at the time of the Final Closing Statement, and such estimated amounts shall thereupon become full and final settlement of such Severance Taxes (the “Settled Severance Taxes,” and together with the Settled Property Taxes, the “Settled Production Taxes”) for purposes of this Agreement.  Buyer shall be entitled to all rights to any refunds of (i) Severance Taxes allocable to Buyer pursuant to this Section 9.3 regardless of when received, and (ii) Settled Severance Taxes.  Seller shall be entitled to all rights to any refunds of Severance Taxes allocated to Seller pursuant to this Section 9.3 other than refunds of Settled Severance Taxes.  After Closing, Buyer shall timely file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for Severance Taxes required to be filed after the Closing and shall timely pay or cause to be paid to the taxing authorities all Severance Taxes that become due and payable after the Closing. Any penalty, addition to Tax, or interest levied or assessed with respect to any Severance Tax shall be allocated to, and shall be payable by, the Party to which the Tax to which such penalty, addition to Tax or interest relates is allocated, regardless of when such penalty, addition to Tax, or interest is levied or assessed; provided, however, that the liability for any penalty, addition to Tax, or interest levied or assessed with respect to any failure of Buyer to comply with the previous sentence shall be allocated to, and shall be payable by, Buyer. 9.4    Transfer Taxes.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Purchase Price excludes, and Buyer shall be liable for, any Transfer Taxes required to be paid in connection with the sale of the Assets pursuant to this Agreement.

Seller shall, at Buyer’s request, supply reasonable documentation available to support any credit, charge, receipt or other item.  Seller shall afford Buyer and its representatives the opportunity to review such statement and the supporting schedules, analyses, work papers, and other underlying records or documentation as are reasonably necessary and appropriate in Buyer’s review of such statement.  Each Party shall cooperate fully and promptly with the other and their respective representatives in such examination with respect to all reasonable requests related thereto.  As soon as reasonably practicable but not later than sixty (60) days following receipt of Seller’s statement hereunder, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a written report containing any changes that Buyer proposes be made to such statement.  Seller and Buyer shall undertake to agree on the Final Settlement Statement no later than thirty (30) days after receipt of Buyer’s written report containing recommended changes (the “Final Settlement Date”).  Unless the Parties are unable to reach agreement on the Final Settlement Statement on or before the Final Settlement Date, then on or prior to the Final Settlement Date, (x) Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount by which the Final Purchase Price exceeds the Closing Amount or (y) Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount by which the Closing Amount exceeds the Final Purchase Price, as applicable (in either case, the “Final Adjustment”).13.2    Dispute Mechanism.  In the event that Seller and Buyer cannot reach agreement by the Final Settlement Date, either Party may refer the remaining matters in dispute to EKS&H LLLP or a regionally-recognized independent accounting firm as may be mutually accepted by Buyer and Seller, for review and final determination (the “Agreed Accounting Firm”).  If issues are submitted to the Agreed Accounting Firm for resolution, Seller and Buyer shall each enter into a customary engagement letter with the Agreed Accounting Firm at the time the issues remaining in dispute are submitted to the Agreed Accounting Firm.  The Agreed Accounting Firm will be directed to (i) review the statement setting forth Seller’s calculation of the Final Purchase Price and the records relating thereto only with respect to items identified by Buyer in its written report containing changes to such statement that remain disputed immediately following the Final Settlement Date and (ii) determine the final adjustments.  Each Party shall furnish the Agreed Accounting Firm such work papers and other records and information relating to the objections in dispute as the Agreed Accounting Firm may reasonably request and that are available to such Party or its Affiliates (and such Parties’ independent public accountants).  The Parties will, and will cause their representatives to, cooperate and assist in the conduct of any review by the Agreed Accounting Firm, including making available books, records and, as available, personnel as reasonably required.  The Agreed Accounting Firm shall conduct the arbitration proceedings in Denver, Colorado in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this Section 13.2.  The Agreed Accounting Firm’s determination shall be made within thirty (30) days after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding on both Parties, without right of appeal and such decision shall constitute an arbitral award upon which a judgment may be entered by a court having jurisdiction thereof.  In determining the proper amount of any adjustment to the Final Purchase Price, the Agreed Accounting Firm shall not increase the Final Purchase Price more than the increase proposed by Seller nor decrease the Final Asset Value more than the decrease proposed by Buyer, as applicable, and may not award damages or penalties to either Party with respect to any matter. Seller and Buyer shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case. Each Party shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the accounting firm.  Within ten (10) business days after the date on which the Parties or the Agreed Accounting Firm, as applicable, finally determines the disputed matters, (x) Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount by which the Final Purchase Price exceeds the Closing Amount or (y) Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount by which the Closing Amount exceeds the Final Purchase Price, as applicable. Any post-Closing payment pursuant to this Section 13.2 shall bear interest from (but not including) the Closing Date to (and including) the date both Buyer and Seller have executed the Final Settlement Statement.  The Parties acknowledge that it is not the intent of this Agreement that either Party be deprived of material amounts of revenue or be burdened by material amounts of expense until the Final Adjustment pursuant to Section 13.1.  If at any time after Closing either Party is owed material revenues or material expense reimbursement, which revenues and expense reimbursement owed shall be netted against revenues and expenses due the other Party, it may request payment from the other Party, not more frequently than monthly, and such Party shall make payment of any undisputed amounts within a commercially reasonable period of time.  13.3    Payments. All payments made or to be made hereunder to Seller shall be by electronic transfer of immediately available funds to the account of Seller as may be specified by Seller in writing. All payments made or to be made hereunder to Buyer shall be by electronic transfer of immediately available funds to a bank and account specified by Buyer in writing to Seller.  Upon execution of the Final Settlement Statement by the Parties and the payment of the Final Adjustment by one Party to the other, neither Party shall have any further obligation for any additional adjustments to the Purchase Price under Section 2.3 or other payment on account of the Assets other than pursuant to Article 14.

If the Indemnifying Party or its counsel so requests, the Indemnified Party shall furnish the Indemnifying Party with copies of all pleadings and other information with respect to such Claim.  At the election of the Indemnifying Party, which must be made within sixty (60) days after receipt of such notice and not thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall permit the Indemnifying Party to assume control of such Claim (to the extent only that such Claim, legal action or other matter relates to a Loss for which the Indemnifying Party is liable), including the determination of all appropriate actions, the negotiation of settlements on behalf of the Indemnified Party, and the conduct of litigation through attorneys of the Indemnifying Party’s choice; provided, however, that no such settlement can result in any liability or cost to the Indemnified Party for which it is entitled to be indemnified hereunder without its prior written consent.  If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume control, (i) all reasonable expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the investigation or defense of the Claim, legal action or other matter prior to the time the Indemnifying Party assumes control shall be reimbursed and paid by the Indemnifying Party, (ii) any expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party thereafter for investigation or defense of the matter shall be borne by the Indemnified Party except for reasonable expenses incurred in connection with providing information or assistance to the Indemnifying Party as required by subsection (iii), and (iii) the Indemnified Party shall give all reasonable information and assistance, other than pecuniary, that the Indemnifying Party shall deem necessary to the proper defense of such Claim, legal action, or other matter but shall be reimbursed and paid for such expenses as provided for in subsection (ii).  Before such election is made or in the absence of such an election, the Indemnified Party shall use its best efforts to defend any claim, legal action or other matter and shall be reimbursed and paid by the Indemnifying Party for all reasonable expenses incurred in such defense.  Before such election is made or in the absence of such election, the Indemnified Party may settle any Claim, legal action or other matter for which notice has been provided as required by Section 14.4(a), but only with the consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld. If such a Claim requires immediate action, both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party will cooperate in good faith to take appropriate action so as not to jeopardize defense of such Claim or either Party’s position with respect to such Claim.(c)    Dispute.  If the existence of a valid Claim or amount to be paid by an Indemnifying Party is in dispute, the Parties agree to submit determination of the existence of a valid Claim or the amount to be paid pursuant to the Claim Notice to binding arbitration pursuant to the provisions of Section 15.10 except as otherwise provided in this Section 14.4.  Any payment due pursuant to the arbitration shall be made within fifteen (15) days of the arbitrators’ decision. 14.5    No Insurance; Subrogation.  The indemnifications provided in this Article 14 shall not be construed as a form of insurance.  Buyer and Seller hereby waive for themselves, their successors or assigns, including any insurers, any rights to subrogation for Losses for which each of them is respectively liable or against which each respectively indemnifies the other, and, if required by applicable policies, Buyer and Seller shall obtain waiver of such subrogation from its respective insurers.14.6    Reductions in Losses.  Each Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Losses, including by maintaining insurance coverage with respect to the Assets and making claims relating to the Assets thereunder.  The amount of any Losses for which an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnity under this Article 14 shall be reduced by the amount of insurance proceeds realized by such Indemnified Party or its Affiliates with respect to such Losses.14.7    Reservation as to Non-Parties.  Nothing herein is intended to limit or otherwise waive any recourse Buyer or Seller may have against any non-party for any obligations or liabilities that may be incurred with respect to the Assets.14.8    Release.

If the Parties are not able to agree upon as single arbitrator in such fifteen (15) day period, each Party shall appoint one arbitrator.

(h)    EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY CONSENTS TO THE SUBMISSION OF ANY DISPUTE FOR SETTLEMENT BY FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 15.10, AND HEREBY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO PROCEED TO COURT OR ANY OTHER FORUM THAT MAY APPLY TO IT BY REASON OF ITS PRESENT OR FUTURE DOMICILE, OR FOR ANY OTHER REASON EXCEPT RECOURSE TO COURTS FOR ENFORCEMENT OF ARBITRAL AWARDS OR OTHER ORDERS OF THE ARBITRATORS ISSUED IN AN ARBITRATION PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION 15.10 OR SEEKING ANY INTERIM OR CONSERVATORY MEASURES OF THE RULES OF ARBITRATION OF THE AAA OR THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 15.10.15.11    Waiver of Certain Damages.

Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the Transaction is fulfilled to the extent possible.15.14    Binding Effect.

In the event such publication shall cease to be published, the Parties shall select a comparable publication;(7)The value of any Casualty Loss pursuant to Section 8.3(c);(8)An amount equal to the revenue held in suspense by Seller for royalties, overriding royalties and similar leasehold burdens and handled in accordance with Section 8.1(h);(9)An amount equal to eleven million dollars ($11,000,000.00) pertaining to that certain Gas Gathering and Processing Agreement dated as of January 1, 2013 between Williams Field Services Company, LLC and Seller (the “Williams Agreement”);(10)An amount equal to the realized gains recognized by Seller between the Effective Time and the Closing Date with respect to the Hedging Transactions;(11)The amount of all Production Taxes allocable to Seller in accordance with Sections 9.2 or 9.3 that are not paid prior to Closing; and(12)Any other amount provided in this Agreement or otherwise agreed to by Buyer and Seller.(e)Well Imbalance Adjustments.  Seller and Buyer agree that the Purchase Price will be adjusted downward or upward, as appropriate, by an amount equal to the net of the well imbalances set forth on Schedule 6.9 multiplied by the average value on an MMbtu basis at the wellhead for sales of production during the month in which the Effective Time occurs. -7-2.4    Allocations for Federal Income Tax Purposes.

As used in this Agreement, the term “Title Defect” means any lien, charge, encumbrance, obligation (including contract obligation), defect, condition or other matter (including a discrepancy in Net Revenue Interest or Working Interest) that causes a breach of Seller's representation and warranty in Section 4.2(a).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following shall not be considered Title Defects:(1)defects based solely on lack of information in Seller's files;(2)defects in the chain of title consisting of the mere failure to recite marital status in a document unless Buyer provides clear and convincing evidence that such failure or omission has resulted in another person's actual and superior claim of title to the relevant Asset;(3)defects based on failure to record Leases issued by any state or federal Governmental Entity (but excluding any assignments of such Leases), in the real property, conveyance or other records of the county in which such Property is located; provided that such Lease is recorded in the official records of the applicable Governmental Entity;(4)defects arising out of lack of survey, unless a survey is expressly required by applicable laws or regulations;(5)defects arising out of lack of evidence of record of corporate or other entity authority of an appropriate designated officer (but not a power of attorney) unless Buyer provides a reasonable basis for the assertion that such corporate or other entity action was not authorized and results in another person's actual and superior claim of title to the relevant Asset(6)defects that have been cured by applicable laws of limitations or prescription; and(7)defects with respect to Seller's title to all or any portion of the Water Rights and the NECO Gathering Systems.(b)Title Benefit.  As used in this Agreement, the term “Title Benefit” shall mean any right, circumstance or condition that operates to (a) increase the Net Revenue Interest being assigned to Buyer in any Lease or Well above that shown for such Lease or Well in Exhibit A or Exhibit B, as applicable, to the extent the same does not cause a greater than proportionate increase in the Working Interest being assigned to Buyer therein above that shown in Exhibit A or Exhibit B, as applicable, or (b) increase the Net Mineral Acres being assigned to Buyer in any Lease to greater than that shown therefor in Exhibit A.  A Title Benefit shall not include any Asset or portion thereof that is excluded from Seller's Defensible Title representation pursuant to Section 4.2(d).(c)Notice of Defective Interest.  At or before 5:00 p.m. Mountain Time on the Defect Notice Date, Buyer shall advise Seller in writing of any matters that in Buyer's opinion constitute a Title Defect with respect to Seller's title to all or any portion of the Leases, Wells or other Assets (“Notice of Defective Interest”).  The Notice of Defective Interest shall be in writing and contain the following:  (i) a description of the alleged Title Defect(s), (ii) the Leases, Wells or other Assets (and the applicable zone(s) therein) affected by the alleged Title Defect (each a “Title Defect Property”), (iii) the Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property, (iv) supporting documentation reasonably necessary for Seller (as well as any title attorney or examiner hired by Seller) to verify the existence of the alleged Title Defect(s), and -13-(v) the amount by which Buyer believes the Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property is reduced by the alleged Title Defect(s) and the computations and information upon which Buyer's belief is based.  Buyer shall also promptly furnish Seller with written notice of any Title Benefit which is discovered by Buyer or any of its representatives while conducting Buyer's title review, due diligence or investigation with respect to the Leases, Wells or other Assets.  (d)Notice of Title Benefits.  At or before 5:00 p.m. Mountain Time on the Defect Notice Date, Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to advise Buyer in writing of any matters that in Seller's opinion constitute a Title Benefit with respect to Seller's title to all or any portion of the Leases, Wells or other Assets (a “Title Benefit Notice”).  The Title Benefit Notice shall be in writing and contain the following:  (i) a description of the Title Benefit, (ii) the Leases, Wells or other Assets (and the applicable zone(s) therein) affected by the Title Benefit (“Title Benefit Property”), (iii) the Allocated Values of the Leases, Wells or other Assets (and the applicable zone(s) therein) subject to such Title Benefit, and (iv) the amount by which the Seller believes the Allocated Value of those Leases, Wells or other Assets (and the applicable zone(s) therein) is increased by the Title Benefit, and the computations and information upon which Seller's belief is based. Seller shall be deemed to have waived all Title Benefits of which it has not given notice on or before the Defect Notice Date.(e)Seller's Right to Cure.  Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at its sole cost, to cure or remove at any time prior to the Closing (the “Cure Period”), to Buyer's reasonable satisfaction, any Title Defects of which it has been advised by Buyer.(f)Remedies for Title Defects.  Subject to Seller's continuing right to dispute the existence of a Title Defect or the Title Defect Amount asserted with respect thereto, in the event that any Title Defect timely asserted by Buyer in accordance with Section 4.3(c) actually exists and is not waived by Buyer or cured to Buyer's reasonable satisfaction on or before the end of the Cure Period, Seller shall convey the Title Defect Property to Buyer at Closing with a reduction to the Purchase Price, provided, however, that Seller shall retain the right to cure such Title Defects after Closing, as set forth herein.  The reduction to the Purchase Price contemplated by the foregoing sentence shall equal the amount of the aggregate Title Defect Amounts for all such Title Defects as determined pursuant to Section 4.3(g), subject to the Individual Title Threshold, the adjustment for certain Title Benefits and the Aggregate Deductible set forth in Section 4.3(i) (as so calculated, the “Title Defect Adjustment”).  Caerus Operating shall deposit an amount equal to the Title Defect Adjustment in the Escrow Account at Closing, which amount shall be released (with accrued interest) to Caerus Operating or PDC in accordance with this Section 4.3(f).  Seller shall have one hundred (100) days after the Closing Date (the “Post-Closing Cure Period”) in which to attempt to cure any such Title Defects to Buyer's reasonable satisfaction, subject to the continuing application of the Individual Title Threshold and the Aggregate Deductible.  Buyer shall use good faith efforts to cooperate with Seller's efforts to cure such Title Defects.  If Seller cures any such Title Defect to Buyer's reasonable satisfaction prior to the end of the Post-Closing Cure Period, then the Title Defect Amount with respect to the Title Defect that is so cured, together with accrued interest, shall promptly be released from the Escrow Account to PDC pursuant to the joint instructions of Caerus Operating and PDC.  If Seller is unable to cure the Title Defect prior to the end of the Post-Closing Cure Period or elects not to cure any such Title Defect, then (i) the Title Defect Amount with respect to the Title Defect that is not cured, together with accrued interest, shall promptly be released from the Escrow Account to Caerus Operating pursuant to the joint instructions of PDC and Caerus Operating, and (ii) if the Title Defect Amount is equal to or greater than the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property, at the request of Seller, the Title Defect Property subject to the Title Defect shall be reconveyed to Seller which shall be deemed to be effective as of the Effective Time.  If the Parties are unable to agree as to whether the Title Defect has been cured to Buyer's -14-reasonable satisfaction, the provisions of Section 4.4 shall apply as written and the Title Arbitrator shall be selected within fifteen (15) business days following the end of the Post-Closing Cure Period. (g)Title Defect Amount.  The “Title Defect Amount” means the amount by which the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property affected by such Title Defect is reduced as a result of the existence of such Title Defect and shall be determined in accordance with the following methodology, terms and conditions:(1)if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Defect Amount, that amount shall be the Title Defect Amount;(2)if the Title Defect is a lien, encumbrance or other charge which is undisputed and liquidated in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the amount of the payment necessary to remove the Title Defect from the Title Defect Property;(3)if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (A) the Net Revenue Interest for any Title Defect Property and (B) the Net Revenue Interest stated in Exhibit A or Exhibit B, as applicable, for such Title Defect Property, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Net Revenue Interest decrease and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest stated in Exhibit A or Exhibit B, as applicable; (4)if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (A) the Net Mineral Acres for any Title Defect Property and (B) the Net Mineral Acres stated on Exhibit A for such Title Defect Property, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Net Mineral Acres decrease and the denominator of which is the Net Mineral Acres stated on Exhibit A; (5)if the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden or charge upon or other defect in title to the Title Defect Property of a type not described in subsections (1), (2), (3) or (4) above, the Title Defect Amount shall be determined by taking into account the following factors:  (i) any discrepancy between (A) the Net Revenue Interest, Net Mineral Acres or Working Interest for any Title Defect Property and (B) the Net Revenue Interest, Net Mineral Acres or Working Interest stated in Exhibit A or Exhibit B, as applicable; (ii) the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property; (iii) the portion of the Title Defect Property affected by the Title Defect; (iv) the legal effect of the Title Defect; (v) the values placed upon the Title Defect by Buyer and Seller; and (vi) such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation; and(6)if the Title Defect represents a failure of Seller to have Defensible Title to an Asset other than a Lease or Well, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the reasonable cost to replace such Asset.Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 4, the aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title Defects upon any Title Defect Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property.  (h)Title Benefit Amount.  “Title Benefit Amount” means the amount by which the Allocated Value of the Title Benefit Property affected by such Title Benefit is increased as a result of the -15-existence of such Title Benefit and shall be determined in accordance with the following methodology, terms and conditions:(1)if Buyer and Seller agree on the amount of the Title Benefit, that amount shall be the Title Benefit Amount;(2)if the Title Benefit represents an increase between (A) the Net Revenue Interest or Net Mineral Acres for any Title Benefit Property and (B) the Net Revenue Interest set forth in Exhibit A or Exhibit B, or Net Mineral Acres set forth in Exhibit A, as applicable, for such Title Benefit Property, then the Title Benefit Amount shall be an amount equal to the product of the Allocated Value of such Title Benefit Property multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Net Revenue Interest or Net Acres increase, and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest set forth in Exhibit A or Exhibit B or Net Mineral Acres set forth in Exhibit A for such Title Benefit Property, as applicable; (3)if the Title Benefit is of a type not described above, then the applicable Title Benefit Amount shall be determined by taking into account the following factors:  (i) any discrepancy between (A) the Net Revenue Interest, Net Mineral Acres or Working Interest for any Title Benefit Property and (B) the Net Revenue Interest, Net Mineral Acres or Working Interest stated in Exhibit A or Exhibit B, as applicable; (ii) the Allocated Value of the Title Benefit Property; (iii) the portion of the Title Benefit Property affected by the Title Benefit; (iv) the legal effect of the Title Benefit; and (v) such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation; and(4)if a Title Benefit Property has no Allocated Value, then such Title Benefit Property shall have no Title Benefit Amount.  (i)Title Thresholds and Deductibles.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (i) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller for any individual Title Defect for which the Title Defect Amount does not exceed fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) (“Individual Title Threshold”); and (ii) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller for any Title Defect that exceeds the Individual Title Threshold unless the aggregate Title Defect Amounts of all Title Defects that exceed the Individual Title Threshold (excluding any Title Defects cured by Seller) less the aggregate Title Benefit Amounts of all individual Title Benefits for which the Title Benefit Amount exceeds fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), when taken together with the aggregate Environmental Defect Values, exceed three and one-quarter percent (3.25%) of the Initial Purchase Price (“Aggregate Deductible”), after which point Buyer shall be entitled to adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies only with respect to such Title Defects and Environmental Defects in excess of such Aggregate Deductible. 4.4    Title Dispute Resolution.  The Parties agree to resolve disputes concerning the following matters pursuant to this Section 4.4:  (i) the existence and scope of a Title Defect or Title Benefit, (ii) the Title Defect Amount or Title Benefit Amount, as the case may be, relating to the portion of the Asset affected by a Title Defect or Title Benefit and (iii) the adequacy of Seller's Title Defect curative materials and Buyer's reasonable satisfaction thereof (the “Title Disputed Matters”).  The Parties agree to attempt to initially resolve all disputes through good faith negotiations.  All Title Disputed Matters that are unresolved by the Parties shall be exclusively and finally resolved by arbitration pursuant to this Section 4.4.  There shall be a single arbitrator, who shall be (i) a title attorney with at least ten (10) years experience in oil and gas titles involving properties in the regional area in which the Lease and Lands are located (“Title Arbitrator”), as selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller within fifteen (15) business days after the end of the Cure Period, and -16-absent such mutual agreement, by the Denver, Colorado office of the American Arbitration Association.  The arbitration proceeding shall be held in Denver, Colorado and shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this Section 4.4.  The Title Arbitrator's determination shall be made within fifteen (15) business days after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding upon both Parties, without right of appeal.  In making his or her determination, the Title Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in this Article 4 and may consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Title Arbitrator are necessary or helpful to make a proper determination.  Additionally, the Title Arbitrator may consult with and engage disinterested third parties to advise the expert or arbitrator, including petroleum engineers.  The Title Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the Title Disputed Matters submitted by either Party and may not award damages, interest or penalties to either Party with respect to any matter.  Each Party may submit only one Title Defect Amount with respect to each alleged Title Defect and one Title Benefit Amount with respect to each Title Benefit (provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to preclude a Party from also arguing against, and the Title Arbitrator determining, the existence of a Title Defect or a Title Benefit).  Seller and Buyer shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case.  Each Party shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Title Arbitrator, including any costs incurred by the Title Arbitrator that are attributable to such third party consultation.  Within ten (10) days after the Title Arbitrator delivers written notice to Buyer and Seller of the award with respect to a Title Disputed Matter, PDC and Caerus Operating shall issue joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to release to PDC or Caerus Operating the amount, if any, awarded by the Title Arbitrator to such Party, plus the interest accrued on such amount.4.5    Preferential Rights and Consents.  The remedies set forth in this Section 4.5 are the exclusive remedies under this Agreement for consents to assign and preferential rights to purchase listed on Schedules 4.5(a) and 4.5(b).(a)Consents.  All required consents to assignment that are necessary for Seller to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement are set forth on Schedule 4.5(a)(i) (the “Required Consents”). Seller shall use reasonable efforts to obtain all Required Consents prior to Closing.  Consents and approvals which are customarily obtained post-Closing shall not be considered Required Consents.  If prior to Closing, Seller fails to obtain the Required Consents set forth on Schedule 4.5(a)(ii) (the “Specified Consents”) that would invalidate the conveyance of the Asset affected by the consent to assign or materially affect the value or use of the Asset (“Affected Asset”), then Seller shall retain the Affected Asset and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of the Affected Asset.  Seller, with Buyer's assistance, shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain such Specified Consent as promptly as possible following Closing.  If such Specified Consent has been obtained as of the Final Settlement Date, Seller shall convey the Affected Asset to Buyer effective as of the Effective Time and Buyer shall pay Seller the Allocated Value of the Affected Asset, less any proceeds from the Affected Asset attributable to the period of time after the Effective Time received and retained by Seller (net of any Property Expenses paid by Seller attributable to such period).  If such Specified Consent has not been obtained as of the Final Settlement Date, the Affected Asset shall be excluded from the sale and the Purchase Price shall be deemed to be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of the Affected Asset.  If prior to May 31, 2013, Seller fails to obtain the Required Consents set forth on Schedule 4.5(a)(iii) then either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 11.1(g).  Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with Seller in obtaining any Required Consent including providing assurances of reasonable financial conditions, but Buyer shall not be required to expend funds or make any other type of financial commitments in order to obtain such consent.-17-(b)Preferential Purchase Rights.  All preferential rights relating to the sale of any of the Assets are set forth on Schedule 4.5(b).  Prior to Closing, Seller shall use reasonable good faith efforts to give notices required in connection with such preferential purchase rights together with any other preferential rights to purchase discovered by Buyer prior to Closing.  If any preferential right to purchase any portion of the Assets is exercised prior to Closing, then that portion of the Assets affected by such preferential purchase right shall be excluded from the Assets and the Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such affected Assets.  If by Closing, either (i) the time frame for the exercise of a preferential purchase right has not expired and Seller has not received notice of an intent not to exercise or a waiver of the preferential purchase right, or (ii) a third party exercises its preferential right to purchase, but the time frame for the consummation of such preferential purchase right has not expired prior to the Closing, then Seller shall retain the affected Assets and the Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such affected Assets.  As to any Assets retained by Seller hereunder, following Closing if a preferential right to purchase is not consummated within the time frame specified in the preferential purchase right, or if the time frame for exercise of the preferential purchase right expired without exercise after the Closing, Seller shall promptly convey the affected Asset to Buyer effective as of the Effective Time, and Buyer shall pay the Allocated Value thereof pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, less any proceeds from such affected Asset attributable to the period of time after the Effective Time received and retained by Seller (net of any Property Expenses paid by Seller attributable to such period).ARTICLE 5ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS5.1    Definitions.

Upon delivery of a timely Environmental Defect Notice, the Parties shall proceed as follows:(a)With respect to each Environmental Defect asserted by Buyer on or before the Defect Notice Date, Seller may elect, in its sole discretion, on or before the date that is three (3) days prior to Closing to:(1)reach agreement with Buyer on the existence of the Environmental Defect and adjust the Purchase Price by the Environmental Defect Value of the Environmental Defect Property subject to application of the Aggregate Deductible with respect to the aggregate Title Defects and Environmental Defects (the “Environmental Defect Adjustment”), whereupon Seller shall convey the Environmental Defect Property to Buyer at Closing and Buyer shall thereafter assume all liability for Remediation of the Environmental Defect Property;(2)if the Environmental Defect Value exceeds the Allocated Value of the Environmental Defect Property, then Seller may remove the Environmental Defect Property from the Transaction and reduce the Purchase Price by the Allocated Value of the Environmental Defect Property; or (3)challenge the existence and/or scope of the Environmental Defect and/or Environmental Defect Value asserted by Buyer pursuant to Section 5.7.  If Seller elects to challenge the existence of an Environmental Defect and/or Environmental Defect Value and such dispute has not been resolved as of Closing, at Closing Caerus Operating shall cause to be paid an amount equal to the claimed Environmental Defect Adjustment attributable to such Environmental Defect to the Escrow Agent.  (b)There shall be no reduction to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller for any Environmental Defect unless the Environmental Defect Values of all Environmental Defects in the aggregate (excluding any Environmental Defects Remediated by Seller), when taken together with the aggregate Title Defect Amounts, exceed the Aggregate Deductible, after which point Buyer shall be -20-entitled to adjustments to the Purchase Price and remedies only with respect to such Environmental Defects in excess of such Aggregate Deductible.5.7    Contested Environmental Defects.  If, pursuant to Section 5.6(a)(3), Seller elects to proceed under this Section 5.7 with respect to an Environmental Defect, the following matters shall be determined pursuant to this Section 5.7: (a) the existence and scope of an Environmental Defect, and (b) the Environmental Defect Value.

The Environmental Expert shall render its decision within twenty (20) business days after submission of the matters in dispute, which decision shall be final and binding upon both Parties, without right of appeal.  In making his or her determination, the Environmental Expert shall be bound by the rules set forth in this Article 5 and may consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Environmental Expert are necessary or helpful to make a proper determination.  The Environmental Expert shall conduct the dispute resolution proceeding by written submissions from Buyer and Seller with exhibits, supplemented with appearances by Buyer and Seller, if necessary, as the Environmental Expert may deem necessary.  The Environmental Expert shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the disputed Environmental Defect matters submitted by either Party and may not award damages, interest or penalties to either Party with respect to any matter.  Seller and Buyer shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case to the Environmental Expert.  Each Party shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Environmental Expert.5.8    Exclusive Remedies.

The date of a New Employee's commencement of active employment with Buyer or one of its Affiliates is referred to herein as such New Employee's “Hire Date.”  (c)With respect to each New Employee and effective as of the time immediately prior to such New Employee's Hire Date, Seller shall (i) terminate the employment of such New Employee and (ii) waive and release any confidentiality, non-competition, non-disclosure and similar agreements between Seller and such New Employee that would restrict or encumber such New Employee's ability to perform any of his or her duties as an employee of Buyer or one of its Affiliates.  (d)Buyer or one of its Affiliates shall take such actions as are necessary to provide each New Employee with credit for the years of service with Seller for purposes of eligibility, vesting, and entitlement to benefits (and for benefit accruals solely with respect to vacation, sick leave, and severance), under all employee benefit plans and all vacation, sick leave, severance, and other compensation plans, policies, agreements and arrangements maintained by Buyer or any of its Affiliates in which such New Employee participates on or after the Closing Date in the same manner as if such service had been service for Buyer or one of its Affiliates completed after the Closing; provided, however, that no prior service credit shall be provided (i) for purposes of any equity-based or other incentive compensation plans or arrangements or (ii) if such credit would result in a duplication of benefits for the same period of service.-31-(e)Buyer or one of its Affiliates shall take such actions as are necessary to offer medical and dental coverage to New Employees and their spouses and dependents under the group health plan made available to employees of Buyer and its Affiliates (the “Buyer Group Health Plan”).

Buyer or one of its Affiliates shall take such actions as are necessary to provide continuation coverage to New Employees and their qualified beneficiaries who incur qualifying events after the Closing Date in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 4980B of the Code or any state analog (collectively “COBRA”).  Seller shall provide COBRA continuation coverage to all other individuals who are M & A qualified beneficiaries (within the meaning assigned to such term under Q&A-4 of Treasury regulation section 54.4980B-9) with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for the duration of the period to which such individuals are entitled to such coverage.  Seller shall take any and all necessary actions to ensure that Buyer and its Affiliates are not required to provide such continuation coverage to any such individual at any time.  (f)With respect to each New Employee, Buyer or one of its Affiliates shall take such actions as are necessary to cause New Employees to participate in any incentive bonus programs in which similarly situated employees of Buyer or its applicable Affiliate that employs such New Employee participate.(g)With respect to events following the Closing, Buyer or one of its Affiliates shall be responsible for sending, if applicable, timely and appropriate notices to all New Employees required under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (“WARN”) and all other similar, applicable laws relating to plant or facility closings or otherwise regulating the termination of employees.

Without limiting the foregoing sentence, to the extent permitted by applicable law, Seller shall, as soon as practicable following the date hereof, provide Buyer and its Affiliates with all employee benefit plan participation information and other related access and data as may be reasonably required by Buyer and its Affiliates to implement the provisions of this Section 8.3 and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enable Buyer and its Affiliates to solicit benefit plan elections from the New Employees sufficiently in advance of each New Employee's Hire Date to permit the implementation of such elections as of such New Employee's Hire Date.(i)Following the Closing, to the extent permitted by applicable law, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be accepted by the trustee of a tax qualified retirement plan maintained by Buyer or one of its Affiliates in which a New Employee is eligible to participate (the “Buyer Retirement Plan”) a “direct rollover” pursuant to Section 401(a)(31) of the Code of all or a portion of any eligible rollover distribution (within the meaning of Section 402(c) of the Code) of such New Employee's account balance (including participant loans) under the The PDC Energy, Inc. 401(k) & Profit Sharing -32-Plan (the “Seller Retirement Plan”), provided that Seller (i) provides to Buyer such information as is satisfactory to Buyer to assure itself that the Seller Retirement Plan satisfies the qualification requirements of Section 401(a) of the Code and (ii) causes the Seller Retirement Plan to provide to Buyer or one of its Affiliates the promissory notes and other loan documentation, if any, of the New Employees who have elected such a direct rollover. The Buyer Retirement Plan shall accept the direct rollover of electing New Employees' benefits in cash and, if applicable, promissory notes that are not accelerated from the Seller Retirement Plan; provided that any such direct rollover shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Buyer Retirement Plan in effect from time to time applicable to rollover contributions and participant loans.  Seller represents, covenants and agrees with respect to the Seller Retirement Plan, and Buyer represents, covenants and agrees with respect to the Buyer Retirement Plan, that, as of each date of a rollover described in this Section 8.3(i), the Seller Retirement Plan or the Buyer Retirement Plan, as applicable, is intended to satisfy the requirements of Sections 401(a), (k), and (m) of the Code.(j)Each Party agrees that, for a period of twelve (12) months following Closing, it will not (and will cause its Affiliates not to), in any manner, directly or indirectly, solicit any person who is an employee of the other Party or any Affiliate of such other Party (other than any Business Employee) to terminate his or her employment with such other Party or any of its Affiliates or apply for or accept employment with the soliciting Party, any of its Affiliates or any other business entity.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, it shall not constitute a violation of this Section 8.3 for a Party or any of its Affiliates to (A) make a general solicitation for employment or other services through any form of media or any third party recruiting firm not specifically directed to the employees, agents or consultants of the other Party or any of its Affiliates and hire any person that responds to the same, or (B) solicit or hire any person who has ceased to be employed by the other Party or any of its Affiliates prior to commencement of employment discussions between the soliciting or hiring Party or any of its Affiliates and such person.  (k)The provisions of this Section 8.3 are solely for the benefit of the Parties and nothing in this Section 8.3, express or implied, shall confer upon any Business Employee, or legal representative or beneficiary thereof, any rights or remedies, including any right to employment or continued employment for any specified period, or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever under this Agreement.  Nothing in this Section 8.3, express or implied, shall be (i) deemed an amendment of any employee benefit plan providing benefits to any Business Employee, or (ii) construed to prevent Buyer or any of its Affiliates from terminating or modifying to any extent or in any respect any employee benefit plan that Buyer or any of its Affiliates may establish or maintain.8.4    Covenants and Agreements of the Parties.(a)Communication Between the Parties Regarding Breach.  If Buyer develops information during its Due Diligence Review that leads Buyer to believe that Seller has breached a representation or warranty under this Agreement, Buyer shall inform Seller in writing of such potential breach as soon as practicable, but in any event, at or prior to Closing.  If any Party believes the other Party has breached any term of this Agreement, the Party who believes the breach has occurred shall promptly give written notice to the breaching Party of the nature of the breach.(b)Announcements.  Prior to the Closing Date, Seller and Buyer shall consult with each other with regard to all press releases and other announcements concerning this Agreement or the Transaction, allowing a reasonable period of time for comment by the other Party; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prevent either Party from timely complying with any applicable securities laws or stock exchange rules.  Except as provided above, prior to the Closing Date, neither Party shall be named -33-in any press release or announcement of the other Party without such Party's prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.(c)Casualty Loss.  Prior to Closing, if a portion of the Assets is destroyed by fire or other casualty or if a portion of the Assets is taken or threatened to be taken in condemnation or under the right of eminent domain (“Casualty Loss”), and the resulting loss from such Casualty Loss exceeds two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000) based on the Allocated Value of the affected Assets, then the following shall occur.  Prior to Closing, Seller, at its sole option and expense, may elect to cure a Casualty Loss with respect to affected personal property by replacing any such personal property with personal property of similar grade or utility that is reasonably acceptable to Buyer.  If prior to Closing the Casualty Loss is cured to Buyer's reasonable satisfaction, Buyer shall purchase the affected Asset at Closing for the Allocated Value thereof and Seller shall be entitled to all insurance proceeds with respect thereto. If a Casualty Loss is not cured to Buyer's reasonable satisfaction prior to Closing, then Buyer may (i) decline to purchase such Asset, in which event the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such Asset; or (ii) elect to purchase such Asset, in which event the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the estimated cost to repair such Asset (with equipment of similar grade or utility that is reasonably acceptable to Buyer) up to the Allocated Value thereof (the reduction being the “Net Casualty Loss”).  (d)Written Instructions.  PDC and Caerus Operating covenant and agree that when a Party becomes entitled to any distribution from the Escrow Account, PDC and Caerus Operating shall within five (5) business days execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent joint written instructions setting forth the amounts to be paid to such Party, if any, from the Escrow Account in accordance with this Agreement.(e)Records.

Seller may retain copies of the Records and Seller shall have the right to review and copy the Records during standard business hours upon reasonable notice for so long as Buyer retains the Records.  Buyer agrees that the Records will be maintained in compliance with all applicable laws governing document retention.  Seller shall be entitled to keep a copy or copies of all Records; provided, however, that Seller shall not sell or otherwise allow third parties to review, copy or otherwise use (for any purpose) any Records retained by Seller for their own account.(f)Transfer of Hedging Transactions.  At Closing, Seller shall transfer to, or novate in favor of, Caerus Operating, the hedging transactions listed on Schedule 8.4(f) which cover a portion of production from the Assets (the “Hedging Transactions”).  Whether or not the Closing occurs, Caerus Operating shall pay and be responsible for any out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Seller related to transferring to, or novating in favor of, Caerus Operating the Hedging Transactions, and, to the extent not provided for in the Final Settlement Statement, shall make any required payments to Seller within ten (10) business days after receipt of an invoice with respect thereto.  From and after the date hereof through the Closing, the Parties will cooperate and take all reasonable actions necessary to obtain any consents required for the novation or transfer of the Hedging Transactions to Caerus Operating at Closing.(g)Garden Gulch.  At or prior to the Closing and to the extent requested by the successor operator to the Garden Gulch Road, PDC, as the sole member and manager of Garden Gulch, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company (“Garden Gulch”), shall transfer the limited liability company membership interests in Garden Gulch or cause Garden Gulch to transfer any and all contracts or agreements of Garden Gulch relating to operation and maintenance of the Garden Gulch Road to such successor operator.-34-(h)Further Assurances.

Severance Taxes shall be deemed attributable to the period during which the production of the Hydrocarbons with respect to such Severance Taxes occurred, and liability therefor shall be allocated to Seller for pre-Effective Time Severance Taxes and to Buyer for post-Effective Time Severance Taxes.  For the purpose of calculating the Closing Amount under Section 2.3 and the Final Purchase Price under Section 13.1, Severance Taxes for which the actual liability amount is not known as of such time shall be estimated based on current Colorado or Kansas Severance Tax rates, as applicable, with the resulting Purchase Price adjustment under Section 13.1 to be considered full and final settlement of all such Taxes without regard to the actual Tax rates or assessments; provided that, if the actual amounts of the applicable Severance Tax rates are not known at the time of the Closing, the amounts shall be re-estimated based on the best information available at the time of the Final Closing Statement, and such estimated amounts shall thereupon become full and final settlement of such Severance Taxes (the “Settled Severance Taxes,” and together with the Settled Property Taxes, the “Settled Production Taxes”) for purposes of this Agreement.  Buyer shall be entitled to all rights to any refunds of (i) Severance Taxes allocable to Buyer pursuant to this Section 9.3 regardless of when received, and (ii) Settled Severance Taxes.

Seller shall, at Buyer's request, supply reasonable documentation available to support any credit, charge, receipt or other item.  Seller shall afford Buyer and its representatives the opportunity to review such statement and the supporting schedules, analyses, work papers, and other underlying records or documentation as are reasonably necessary and appropriate in Buyer's review of such statement.  Each Party shall cooperate fully and promptly with the other and their respective representatives in such examination with respect to all reasonable requests related thereto.  As soon as reasonably practicable but not later than sixty (60) days following receipt of Seller's statement hereunder, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a written report containing any changes that Buyer proposes be made to such statement.  Seller and Buyer shall undertake to agree on the Final Settlement Statement no later than thirty (30) days after receipt of Buyer's written report containing recommended changes (the “Final Settlement Date”).  Unless the Parties are unable to reach agreement on the Final Settlement Statement on or before the Final Settlement Date, then on or prior to the Final Settlement Date, (x) Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount by which the Final Purchase Price exceeds the Closing Amount or (y) Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount by which the Closing Amount exceeds the Final Purchase Price, as applicable (in either case, the “Final Adjustment”).13.2    Dispute Mechanism.  In the event that Seller and Buyer cannot reach agreement by the Final Settlement Date, either Party may refer the remaining matters in dispute to EKS&H LLLP or a regionally-recognized independent accounting firm as may be mutually accepted by Buyer and Seller, for review and final determination (the “Agreed Accounting Firm”).  If issues are submitted to the Agreed Accounting Firm for resolution, Seller and Buyer shall each enter into a customary engagement letter with the Agreed Accounting Firm at the time the issues remaining in dispute are submitted to the Agreed Accounting Firm.  The Agreed Accounting Firm will be directed to (i) review the statement setting forth Seller's calculation of the Final Purchase Price and the records relating thereto only with respect to items identified by Buyer in its written report containing changes to such statement that remain disputed immediately following the Final Settlement Date and (ii) determine the final adjustments.  Each Party shall furnish the Agreed Accounting Firm such work papers and other records and information relating to the objections in dispute as the Agreed Accounting Firm may reasonably request and that are available to such Party or its Affiliates (and such Parties' independent public accountants).  The Parties will, and will cause their representatives to, cooperate and assist in the conduct of any review by the Agreed Accounting Firm, including making available books, records and, as available, personnel as reasonably required.  The Agreed Accounting Firm shall conduct the arbitration proceedings in Denver, Colorado in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this Section 13.2.  The Agreed Accounting Firm's determination shall be made within thirty (30) days after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding on both Parties, without right of appeal and such decision shall constitute an arbitral award upon which a judgment may be entered by a court having jurisdiction thereof.  -43-In determining the proper amount of any adjustment to the Final Purchase Price, the Agreed Accounting Firm shall not increase the Final Purchase Price more than the increase proposed by Seller nor decrease the Final Asset Value more than the decrease proposed by Buyer, as applicable, and may not award damages or penalties to either Party with respect to any matter. Seller and Buyer shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case. Each Party shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the accounting firm.  Within ten (10) business days after the date on which the Parties or the Agreed Accounting Firm, as applicable, finally determines the disputed matters, (x) Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount by which the Final Purchase Price exceeds the Closing Amount or (y) Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount by which the Closing Amount exceeds the Final Purchase Price, as applicable. Any post-Closing payment pursuant to this Section 13.2 shall bear interest from (but not including) the Closing Date to (and including) the date both Buyer and Seller have executed the Final Settlement Statement.  The Parties acknowledge that it is not the intent of this Agreement that either Party be deprived of material amounts of revenue or be burdened by material amounts of expense until the Final Adjustment pursuant to Section 13.1.  If at any time after Closing either Party is owed material revenues or material expense reimbursement, which revenues and expense reimbursement owed shall be netted against revenues and expenses due the other Party, it may request payment from the other Party, not more frequently than monthly, and such Party shall make payment of any undisputed amounts within a commercially reasonable period of time.  13.3    Payments.  All payments made or to be made hereunder to Seller shall be by electronic transfer of immediately available funds to the account of Seller as may be specified by Seller in writing. All payments made or to be made hereunder to Buyer shall be by electronic transfer of immediately available funds to a bank and account specified by Buyer in writing to Seller.  Upon execution of the Final Settlement Statement by the Parties and the payment of the Final Adjustment by one Party to the other, neither Party shall have any further obligation for any additional adjustments to the Purchase Price under Section 2.3 or other payment on account of the Assets other than pursuant to Article 14.

The amount claimed shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party to the extent required herein -46-within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Claim Notice, or after the amount of such payment has been finally established as provided in Section 14.4(c), whichever last occurs.(b)Information.  Within thirty (30) days after the Indemnified Party receives notice of a claim or legal action by a third party that may result in a Loss for which indemnification may be sought under this Article 14 (a “Claim”), the Indemnified Party shall give written notice of such Claim to the Indemnifying Party.  If the Indemnifying Party or its counsel so requests, the Indemnified Party shall furnish the Indemnifying Party with copies of all pleadings and other information with respect to such Claim.  At the election of the Indemnifying Party, which must be made within sixty (60) days after receipt of such notice and not thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall permit the Indemnifying Party to assume control of such Claim (to the extent only that such Claim, legal action or other matter relates to a Loss for which the Indemnifying Party is liable), including the determination of all appropriate actions, the negotiation of settlements on behalf of the Indemnified Party, and the conduct of litigation through attorneys of the Indemnifying Party's choice; provided, however, that no such settlement can result in any liability or cost to the Indemnified Party for which it is entitled to be indemnified hereunder without its prior written consent.  If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume control, (i) all reasonable expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the investigation or defense of the Claim, legal action or other matter prior to the time the Indemnifying Party assumes control shall be reimbursed and paid by the Indemnifying Party, (ii) any expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party thereafter for investigation or defense of the matter shall be borne by the Indemnified Party except for reasonable expenses incurred in connection with providing information or assistance to the Indemnifying Party as required by subsection (iii), and (iii) the Indemnified Party shall give all reasonable information and assistance, other than pecuniary, that the Indemnifying Party shall deem necessary to the proper defense of such Claim, legal action, or other matter but shall be reimbursed and paid for such expenses as provided for in subsection (ii).
