Exchange
Agreement

 

This
Exchange Agreement (“Agreement”) is made and entered into, effective as of __________
__, 2014 (the "Effective Date"), by and between EnerJex Resources,
Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Company”), and the stockholders of the Company holding shares
of the Company's "Existing Series A Shares," as such term is defined below (the “Stockholders”),
with reference to the following facts:

 

Recitals

 

A.                
Each of the Stockholders is a holder of shares of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock (the “Existing
Series A Shares”) having the rights, preferences, and privileges, and subject to the restrictions and limitations,
set forth in that certain "Certificate of Designation of Preferences, Rights, and Limitations of Series A Preferred Stock"
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada on December 31, 2010 (the "Existing COD").

 

B.                
Under the terms of the Existing COD, (i) the Company issued 4,779,460 Existing Series A Shares at a price of $1.00 per share,
(ii) each such Existing Series A Share is presently convertible into one (1) share of Common Stock, (iii) each Stockholder is entitled
to receive certain preferential dividends in an aggregate cumulative amount equal to $1.00 per share (i.e., preferential
dividends in an aggregate cumulative amount equal to $4,779,460 for all Stockholders) (such preferential payment, the "Series
A Preferential Dividend"), and (iv) upon the Company's payment of aggregate cumulative amount equal to $1.00 per Existing
Series A Share, all issued and outstanding Existing Series A Shares will be automatically converted into Common Stock at the then-current
conversion ratio.

 

C.                
At present, the Company has paid cumulative Series A Preferential Dividends to the Stockholders in the amount of $[1,704,239],
and the Stockholders in the aggregate are entitled to future Series A Preferential Dividends in the aggregate amount of $[3,075,221].

 

D.                
The Company is seeking to simplify its capital structure, to eliminate the financial and operating constraints imposed by
the terms of the preferential dividends payable with respect to the Existing Series A Shares, and to raise additional working capital
through the issuance of shares of preferred stock, and in order to accomplish those objectives, the Company is proposing:

 

(i)                
To adopt and file that certain "Amended and Restated Certificate of Designation of Preferences, Rights, and Limitations
of Series A Preferred Stock" in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A
(the "Restated COD"), in order to amend the terms of the Existing Series A Shares to be as set forth in
that Restated COD (the shares of Series A Preferred, as their terms are so amended, the "New Series A Shares");
and

 

(ii)              
To issue and sell New Series A Shares to investors, in an underwritten public offering of such shares (the "Public
Offering"), at such price per share that is paid by the investors subscribing for New Series A Shares in that Public
Offering (such price per share, the "Original Issue Price"); and

 

(iii)            
Concurrently with the first closing of the issuance of the New Series A Shares in that Public Offering, to effect a share
exchange transaction (the "Share Exchange") in which each of the Stockholders will exchange each Existing
Series A Share for the following shares (the "New Shares"):

 

(A)             
one (1) share of the Company’s Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the "Common Stock"),
and

 




    1.
     
    

 

(B)             
a number of New Series A Shares equal to the quotient determined by dividing (x) the Stockholder's undisbursed Series A
Preferential Dividend with respect to each Existing Series A Share owned by the Stockholder, by (y) the New Series A Original Issue
Price per share.

 

E.                 
The adoption of the Restated COD and the execution and delivery of this Agreement are conditions precedent to the closing
of the Public Offering.

 

F.                 
The parties intend for the Share Exchange to be a tax free exchange of property pursuant to Section 368 of the Internal
Revenue Code, and to be exempt from registration under Section 3a-9 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act").

 

Agreement

 

Now
Therefore, the Company and the Stockholders, intending to be legally bound, and for mutual and valid consideration,
agree as follows:

 


Section1      
Exchange of Shares 

 

1.1             
Share Exchange. Upon consummation
of the Share Exchange:

 

(a)              
Each of the Stockholders will transfer the Existing Series A Shares to the Company for cancellation, and

 

(b)              
The Company will issue and deliver to each Stockholder with respect to each Existing Series A Share owned by such Stockholder:

 

(i)                
one (1) share of the Company’s Common Stock; and

 

(ii)              
a number of New Series A Shares equal to the quotient determined by dividing (x) the Stockholder's undisbursed Series
A Preferential Dividend, by (y) the New Series A Original Issue Price per share. No fractional shares will be issued in that exchange;
in lieu thereof, the Company will deliver to each holder cash for fractions of a share based upon the New Series A Original Issue
Price per whole share.

 

1.2             
Transfer Taxes. Any transfer taxes, stamp duties, filing fees,
recordation expenses, or other similar taxes, fees, charges or expenses incurred by a Stockholder in connection with the transfer
of the Existing Series A Shares to the Company or in connection with any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will be borne and paid by such Stockholder.

 


Section2      
The Share Exchange 

 

2.1             
Closing; Exchange Date. The closing of the Share Exchange contemplated
by Section 1 (the “Closing”) will be held at the offices of the Company (or by consummated
by remote delivery of documents by overnight courier, facsimile, and email) on such date as is selected by the Company upon not
less than five (5) days' prior written notice to the Stockholders and is prior to the date of the first closing of the issuance
of the New Series A Shares in the Public Offering (the “Exchange Date”).

 




    2.
     
    

 

2.2             
Deliveries. At the Closing:

 

(a)              
Each Stockholder will deliver to the Company (i) all stock certificates representing the Existing Series A Shares owned
by such Stockholder, for cancellation by the Company (or, if a Stockholder is unable to find one or more such stock certificates,
then a lost securities affidavit in form acceptable to the Company), and (ii) a stock assignment separate from certificate in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit B;

 

(b)              
The Company will issue new certificates to each Stockholder representing the newly issued New Shares; and

 

(c)               
Upon the Share Exchange Date, each Existing Series A Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to such date will,
without any further action by the Company, be canceled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares.

Stockholders. Each of the Stockholders represents and warrants to the Company, severally and
not jointly, that the following statements are true, accurate and complete in all material respects:

that the New Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”).
Each Stockholder represents that it is an accredited investor within the meaning of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Stockholder

4.3             
Compliance with Other Instruments. The execution, delivery, and
performance of and compliance with this Agreement and the issuance of the New Shares pursuant to the Share Exchange, will not,

subsidiaries, its business or operations or any of its assets or properties.

    4.
     
    

 

5.2             
Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is for any reason
found to be ineffective, unenforceable, or illegal by any court having jurisdiction, such condition shall not affect the validity
or enforceability of any of the remaining portions hereof, unless it deprives any party hereto of any material right or license
held by such party under this Agreement. The parties shall negotiate in good faith to replace any such ineffective, unenforceable
or illegal provisions as soon as is practicable, and the substituted provision shall, as closely as possible, have the same economic
effect as the eliminated provision.

 

5.3             
Binding Effect. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

 

5.4             
Force Majeure. Neither party shall be liable for any default or
delay in performance of any of its obligations under this Agreement if such default or delay is caused, directly or indirectly,
by fire, flood, earthquake or other acts of God; labor disputes, strikes or lockouts; wars, rebellions or revolutions; riots or
civil disorder; accidents or unavoidable casualties; interruptions in transportation or communications facilities or delays in
transit or communication; supply shortages or the failure of any Person to perform any commitment to such party related to this
Agreement; or any other cause (whether similar or dissimilar to those expressly enumerated in this Section 5.4) beyond such
party's reasonable control.

 

5.5             
Entire Agreement. This Agreement, and the exhibits hereto set forth

Amendments and Waivers. Any term of this Agreement may be amended
and the observance of any term of this Agreement may be waived (either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively
or prospectively), only with the written consent of the Company and the Stockholders owing at least a majority of the Existing
Series A Shares. Any amendment or waiver effected in accordance with this Section 5.6 shall be binding upon the Company,
each Investor, and any transferee of any Securities. Each Stockholder acknowledges that by the operation of this Section 5.6,
less than all of the Stockholders who are parties hereto may effect an amendment or waiver of provisions of this Agreement and
may thereby diminish or eliminate rights of such Stockholder under this Agreement even though such Stockholder has not consented
to the amendment or waiver.

 

(a)              
Exculpation Among Stockholders. Each Stockholder acknowledges that
such Stockholder is not relying upon any person, firm or corporation, other than the Company and its officers and directors, in
making its investment or decision to invest in the Company. Each Stockholder agrees that no Stockholder nor the respective controlling
persons, officers, directors, partners, agents or employees of any Stockholder shall be liable to any other Stockholder for any
action heretofore or hereafter taken or omitted to be taken by any of them in connection with the issuance of the Notes hereunder
and any shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes.

 

(b)              
Rights of Stockholders. The Stockholders (or transferee holder
of Securities) shall have the absolute right to exercise or refrain from exercising any right or rights that such holder may have
by reason of this Agreement, including without limitation the right to consent to the waiver of any obligation of the Company under
this Agreement and to enter into an agreement with the Company for the purpose of modifying this Agreement or any agreement effecting
any such modification, and the Stockholders or transferee holder shall not incur any liability to any other Stockholders or holder
of Securities with respect to exercising or refraining from exercising any such right or rights.

 




    5.
     
    

 

5.7

5.8             
Attorneys' Fees. If any action or proceeding is commenced to construe
