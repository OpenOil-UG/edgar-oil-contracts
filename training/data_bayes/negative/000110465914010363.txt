4.2       Remedies. If an Event of Default occurs under this Agreement, Lender may exercise any right or remedy which it has under any of the Loan Documents, or which is otherwise available at law or in equity or by statute, and all of Lenders rights and remedies shall be cumulative. All of Borrowers obligations under the Loan Documents shall become immediately due and payable without notice of default, presentment or demand for payment, protest or notice of nonpayment or dishonor, or other notices or demands of any kind or character, all at Lenders option, exercisable in its sole discretion.
 
Notwithstanding any provision in any of the Loan Documents to the contrary and in addition to the foregoing, in the event Borrower or any Affiliate shall violate any covenant contained in Section 2.11(a) through (g) of this Agreement, then Lender, at its sole option and upon written notice to Borrower, may increase the interest rate under the Note by one percent (1.0%) from the interest rate then in effect, and adjust the monthly payments due under the Note accordingly. If such violation is cured, then the interest rate shall be reduced to the interest rate then in effect under the provisions of the Note and the monthly payments due under the Note shall be readjusted accordingly.
 
Notwithstanding any provision in any of the Loan Documents to the contrary and in addition to the foregoing, in the event Borrower or any Guarantor shall violate any covenant contained in Section 2.11(h) through 2.11(1) of this Agreement, then the interest rate under the Note shall be increased, at Lenders sole option and upon written notice to Borrower or any Guarantor, by one percent (1.0%) from the interest rate then in effect and the monthly payments due under the Note shall be adjusted accordingly. If such violation is not cured within 45 days after the increase in the interest rate, then the interest rate will be increased effective at the end of such 45 day period, at Lenders sole option and upon written notice to Borrower or such Guarantor, by an additional one percent (1.0%) and the monthly payments due under the Note shall be adjusted accordingly. If such violation is cured, then the interest rate shall be reduced to the interest rate then in effect under the provisions of the Note and the monthly payments due under the Note shall be readjusted accordingly.

15






 
4.4       Provisional Remedies, Self-Help and Foreclosure. No provision of this Article 4 limits the right of any party to this Agreement to exercise self-help remedies such as setoff, foreclosure against or sale of any real or personal property collateral or security, or obtaining provisional or ancillary remedies from a court of competent jurisdiction before, after, or during the pendency of any arbitration or other proceeding. The exercise of a remedy does not waive the right of either party to resort to arbitration or reference. At Lenders option, foreclosure under a deed of trust or mortgage may be accomplished either by exercise of power of sale under the deed of trust or mortgage or by judicial foreclosure.
 
5.                                    Miscellaneous Provisions.
 
5.1       No Waiver; Consents. No alleged waiver by Lender is effective unless in writing, and no waiver may be construed as a continuing waiver.

5.2       No Third Parties Benefited. This Agreement is made and entered into for the sole protection and benefit of Lender and Borrower and their successors and assigns. No trust fund is created by this Agreement and no other persons or entities have any right of action under this Agreement or any right to the Loan funds.

Any such attorneys fees incurred by either party in enforcing a judgment in its favor under this Agreement are recoverable separately from and in
 
16






 
addition to any other amount included in such judgment, and such attorneys fees obligations are intended to be severable from the other provisions of this Agreement and to survive and not be merged into any such judgment.

To the extent of any such assignment, Lender shall be relieved of its obligations with respect to the Loan and the assignee shall have the same rights, benefits and obligations as it would if it were Lender hereunder and a holder of the Note. Without the consent of or notice to Borrower, Lender may furnish any information (including, without limitation, financial information) concerning the Loan, the collateral for the Loan, or Borrower, any Affiliates, and any of their assets to third parties from time to time for legitimate business purposes.
 
5.7       Successors and Assigns. The terms of this Agreement shall bind and benefit the heirs, personal representatives, successors, successors in trust and assigns of the parties; provided, however, that Borrower may not assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of Lender, which consent may be withheld by Lender in its sole discretion for any reason or no reason.

5.9       Miscellaneous. This Agreement may not be modified or amended except by a written agreement signed by the parties. The invalidity or unenforceability of any one or more provisions of this Agreement in no way affects any other provision. If Borrower consists of more than one person or entity, each is jointly and severally liable to Lender for the faithful performance of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Time is of the essence in the performance of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of and decisions of the State of Hawaii and the United States of America and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, including without limitation the federal laws, rules and regulations for federal savings and loan associations and federal savings banks. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which is, for all purposes deemed an original and all such counterparts taken together, constitute one and the same instrument.
 
17

The Loan Documents supersede all oral negotiations and prior writings concerning the subject matter of the Loan Documents.
 
5.11     Actions. Lender has the right, but not the obligation, to commence, appear in, and defend any action or proceeding which might affect its security or its rights, duties or liabilities relating to the Loan, the Property, or any of the Loan Documents.

5.12     Relationships with Other Lender Customers. From time to time, Lender may have business relationships with Borrowers customers, suppliers, contractors, tenants, partners, shareholders, officers or directors, with businesses offering products or services similar to those of Borrower, or with persons seeking to invest in, borrow from or lend to Borrower. Borrower agrees that in no event is Lender obligated to disclose to Borrower any information concerning any other Lender customer. Borrower further agrees that Lender may extend credit to those parties and may take any action it may deem necessary to collect any such credit, regardless of any effect the extension or collection of such credit may have on Borrowers financial condition or operations.
 
5.13     Loan Commission. Lender is not obligated to pay any brokerage commission or fee in connection with or arising out of the Loan.

5.14     Standard of Conduct. Nothing contained in this Agreement, the Note, the Accommodation Mortgage or any other Loan Document shall limit the right of Lender to exercise its business judgment or to act, in the context of the granting or withholding of any consent required under the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or otherwise, in a subjective manner, whether or not objectively reasonable under the circumstances, as long as Lenders exercise of its business judgment or action, as the case may be, is made or undertaken in good faith. Borrower and Lender intend by the foregoing to set forth and affirm their entire understanding with respect to the standard pursuant to which Lenders duties and obligations are to be judged and the parameters within which Lenders discretion may be exercised hereunder and under the other Loan Documents. As used herein, the term good faith means honesty in fact in the conduct and transaction concerned.
 
5.15     Counterparts. This document may be executed in counterparts. Each counterpart shall be executed by one or more of the parties to this document and the several counterparts shall constitute one document to the same effect as though the signature of all the parties were upon the same document.
 
5.16     Jury Waiver. Lender and Borrower hereby waive trial by jury in any action, proceeding, claim, or counterclaim, whether in contract or tort, at law or in equity, arising out of or in any way related to this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents.
