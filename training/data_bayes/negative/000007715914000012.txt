Except for the Purchased Assets expressly described in Section 1.1 above, Sellers shall not sell, and Buyer shall not purchase, any other assets, properties, interests or rights of Sellers.1.3    Assumed Liabilities.  As of the Effective Time, Buyer shall assume all liabilities, duties, obligations and responsibilities of every kind whatsoever attributable to the Purchased Assets, whether known or unknown, whether attributable to the period of time before or after the Effective Time (collectively, the “Assumed Liabilities”).ARTICLE 2PURCHASE PRICE2.1    Purchase Price.  The aggregate purchase price (the “Purchase Price”) for the Purchased Assets shall be (a) One Hundred Million Dollars ($100,000,000) (the “Base Purchase Price”), plus (b) the amount, if any, of all capital costs and expenses in respect of the Purchased Assets paid by Sellers prior to the date upon which the Proposed Final Settlement Statement is due to Buyer pursuant to Section 2.3(b) and either (i) incurred after October 1, 2013 (the “Capital 2Date”) and prior to the date hereof as set forth on Schedule 5.3 or (ii) incurred between the date hereof and the Closing Date in accordance with Section 5.3(c)(vii) ((i) and (ii) collectively, the “Capital Adjustment”), minus (c) the amount, if any, of all costs and expenses incurred by Buyer to create “as-built” maps for the Purchased Assets as set forth on Schedule 2.1.2.2    Purchase Price Allocation.  As soon as practicable but no later than 90 days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to Sellers an allocation of the Base Purchase Price (and all other capitalizable costs) among the Purchased Assets (the “Initial Allocation” and any revision thereto as provided hereunder, the “Purchase Price Allocation”).  Upon any adjustment to the Base Purchase Price or the Assumed Liabilities pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or upon any Assumed Liability that was contingent becoming fixed and ascertainable, capitalizable costs becoming fixed and ascertainable, or any purchase price adjustment due to indemnification, Buyer shall deliver to Sellers a proposed revision to the Purchase Price Allocation then in effect, which shall be consistent with the methodology used to prepare the Initial Allocation.  Upon (i) Buyer’s delivery of the Initial Allocation or (ii) Buyer’s delivery of any proposed revision, Sellers shall have 10 business days to object to such proposed purchase price allocation.  If the Sellers do not timely object, the proposed purchase price allocation shall become the Purchase Price Allocation.  If the Sellers do timely object, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such objection promptly; provided, however, that, if the Parties fail to agree on a new Purchase Price Allocation within 30 days of Buyer’s notice of proposed revision, either Party may refer the proposed revision and the objection to Deloitte & Touche LLP (the “Audit Firm”) and the resolution by such firm shall become the Purchase Price Allocation.  The Parties shall each report the federal, state and local income and other tax consequences of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (which for such purposes includes the Transaction Documents (as defined in Section 3.4 below)) in a manner consistent with the Purchase Price Allocation, including the preparation and filing of Form 8594 under Section 1060 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (or any successor form or successor provision of any future tax law, or any comparable provision of state or local tax law), with respect to their respective federal, state and local income tax returns for the taxable year that includes the Closing Date and shall not take any position contrary thereto in connection with any amended return.2.3    Purchase Price Adjustments.(a)    No later than three days prior to the Closing, the Seller Representative (as defined in Section 9.1(a) below) shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a preliminary settlement statement prepared by the Seller Representative in accordance with this Agreement and generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied by Seller (the “Preliminary Settlement Statement”), which sets forth the Seller Representative’s good faith estimate of the Capital Adjustment.(b)    As soon as practicable but no later than 90 days after the Closing, the Seller Representative shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a statement in the same form of and on the same basis as the Preliminary Settlement Statement (the “Proposed Final Settlement Statement”), which sets forth the Seller Representative’s calculation of the final Purchase Price and each adjustment or payment that was not finally determined on the Preliminary Settlement Statement.  Each Party shall, during normal business hours, grant and provide the other Party access to the Purchased Records in the possession or control of such Party for the purposes of 3conducting an audit of the information set forth in the Proposed Final Settlement Statement.(c)    Within 30 days following receipt by Buyer of the Proposed Final Settlement Statement, Buyer shall, if applicable, provide the Seller Representative with a written objection (a “Notice of Disagreement”) detailing Buyer’s objections, if any, to the Seller Representative’s calculation of the final Purchase Price.  To the extent such written notice is not delivered by Buyer within such time period, the Seller Representative’s calculation of the final Purchase Price, and each component thereof, shall become final and binding upon the Parties.(d)    Any disagreement between Buyer and Sellers regarding the Seller Representative’s calculation of the final Purchase Price that cannot be resolved within 30 days after the date of the Notice of Disagreement shall be resolved by Audit Firm, who shall calculate the final Purchase Price in a manner consistent with the Preliminary Settlement Statement and this Agreement in all respects.  Sellers and Buyer shall each have an opportunity to present its position to the Audit Firm and shall cooperate with the Audit Firm in making available to it any records or work papers requested by the Audit Firm.  The determination of the Audit Firm shall be expressly limited to the determination of the final Purchase Price, and the Audit Firm will not render any decision or have any authority to render a decision with respect to any other matter relating to this Agreement, including with respect to any alleged breach of a representation, warranty or covenant by any Party.  In making such determination, the Audit Firm shall consider only those items and amounts in the Proposed Final Settlement Statement with which Buyer has disagreed and which are set forth in the Notice of Disagreement.  In no event shall the final Purchase Price as determined by the Audit Firm be more favorable to Sellers than reflected on the Proposed Final Settlement Statement by the Seller Representative nor more favorable to Buyer than shown in the proposed changes set forth in the Notice of Disagreement.  Buyer and Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Audit Firm to render its decision within 15 business days after such points of disagreement are submitted to the Audit Firm.  Subject to the provisions set forth in this Section 2.3(d), the decision of the Audit Firm shall be set forth in writing and shall be conclusive and binding on the Parties and subject to judicial enforcement.  The fees charged by the Audit Firm shall be borne 50% by Buyer and 50% by Sellers, and each Party shall bear all of its own costs and expenses associated with the submission of any disputed matters to the Audit Firm.(e)    If the final Purchase Price, as determined pursuant to this Section 2.3, exceeds (i) the Base Purchase Price, plus (ii) the Seller Representative’s good faith estimate of the Capital Adjustment (the “Closing Payment”), then Buyer shall pay to Sellers the amount of such excess.  If the final Purchase Price, as determined pursuant to this Section 2.3, is less than the Closing Payment, then Sellers shall pay to Buyer the amount of such deficiency.  Any payment shall be made within three days after the date the final Purchase Price is deemed to be finally determined pursuant to this Section 3.4 via wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s) designated in writing by the Party entitled to such payment.2.4    Payment of Closing Payment.  At the Closing, Buyer shall pay to each Seller such Seller’s Pro Rata Share of the Closing Payment in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account(s) designated by such Seller.  “Pro Rata Share” means, with respect to each Seller, the percentage set forth next to such Seller’s name on Schedule 2.4.42.5    Revenues and Expenses.(a)    The Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) Sellers shall bear all (A) operating expenses which are incurred in respect of the ownership, maintenance, use or operation of the Purchased Assets before the Effective Time and (B) capital expenses which are incurred in respect of the ownership, maintenance, use or operation of the Purchased Assets before the Capital Date (the “Seller Expenses”), (ii) Sellers shall be entitled to receive all proceeds collectible in respect of the ownership, use or operation of the Purchased Assets attributable to the period prior to the Effective Time (the “Pre-Closing Revenues”), (iii) Buyer shall bear all (A) operating expenses which are incurred in respect of the ownership, maintenance, use or operation of the Purchased Assets after the Effective Time and (B) capital expenses which are incurred in respect of the ownership, maintenance, use or operation of the Purchased Assets after the Capital Date (the “Buyer Expenses”) and (iv) Buyer shall be entitled to receive all proceeds in respect of the ownership, use or operation of the Purchased Assets attributable to the period after the Effective Time (the “Post-Closing Revenues”).(b)    In the event that Buyer pays any Seller Expenses, Sellers shall promptly reimburse Buyer for the amount of Seller Expenses paid by Buyer.  In the event that Sellers receive any invoice or other statement relating to Buyer Expenses, Sellers shall promptly forward such invoice or statement to Buyer.(c)    Promptly following the Closing, Sellers shall irrevocably authorize, instruct and direct all account parties to the Contracts from whom Post-Closing Revenues are or may be owed to Buyer to make and deliver all payments relating thereto on or after the Closing Date to such location, bank and account as Buyer shall specify.  In the event that any Seller or any of its Affiliates receives any Post-Closing Revenues, Sellers shall promptly deliver all such Post-Closing Revenues to Buyer.  In the event that Buyer or any of its Affiliates receives any Pre-Closing Revenues, Buyer shall promptly deliver all such Pre-Closing Revenues to Sellers.ARTICLE 3CLOSING3.1    Time and Place of Closing.

All claims for indemnification under this Agreement related to Third Party Claims shall be asserted and resolved pursuant to this Section 7.4.(a)    Promptly after the receipt by any Person seeking indemnification hereunder (an “Indemnified Party”) of a notice of any Proceeding by any third party that may be subject to indemnification hereunder (a “Third Party Claim”), such Indemnified Party shall give written notice of such Third Party Claim to the indemnifying Party (the “Indemnifying Party”) stating the nature and basis of the Third Party Claim and the amount thereof, to the extent known, along with copies of the relevant documents evidencing the Third Party Claim and the basis for indemnification sought.  Failure of the Indemnified Party to give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability on account of this indemnification, except if and to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced thereby.(b)    The Indemnifying Party, at its own expense, shall have the right, exercisable within 30 days of receipt of notice of the Third Party Claim, to assume the defense of the Indemnified Party against the Third Party Claim so long as (i) the Indemnifying Party proceeds in good faith and in a timely manner and (ii) such Third Party Claim involves (and continues to involve) solely monetary damages.(c)    So long as the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with Section 7.4(b) above, (i) the Indemnified Party may retain separate co‑counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim, it being understood that the Indemnifying Party shall pay all costs and expenses of counsel for the Indemnified Party (A) for all periods prior to such time as the Indemnifying Party has notified the Indemnified Party that it has assumed the defense of such Third Party Claim and (B) if there is a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, (ii) the Indemnified Party shall not file any papers or consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and (iii) the Indemnifying Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).(d)    The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize Damages from Third Party Claims and shall act in good faith and in a timely manner in responding to, defending against, settling or otherwise dealing with Third Party Claims.  The Parties shall also cooperate in any such defense and give each other reasonable access to all information relevant thereto.  Whether or not the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder for any settlement entered into without the Indemnifying Party’s prior written consent, which consent shall not unreasonably withheld or delayed.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the sole and exclusive right 24to settle any Third Party Claim, on such terms and conditions as it deems reasonably appropriate, to the extent such claim involves equitable or other non‑monetary relief.7.5    Other Limitations on Indemnification.(a)    No Party shall have any liability pursuant to Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.3(a) above with respect to any breach of any representation or warranty (other than any Fundamental Representation) unless and until the aggregate amount of all of the Damages to the Buyer Indemnified Parties exceeds $2,000,000 (the “Indemnification Threshold”), in which case the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification only to the extent of the excess over the Indemnification Threshold.  There shall be no threshold or deductible with respect to (i) Sellers’ obligations to Buyer pursuant to Section 7.2(a) above with respect to any breach of any Fundamental Representation or pursuant to Section 7.2(b) above or (ii) Buyer’s obligations to Sellers pursuant to Section 7.3(b) or Section 7.3(c).(b)    The aggregate liability of any Party pursuant to this Article 7 shall in no event exceed, individually or in the aggregate, $15,000,000; provided, however, that subject to Section 7.5(c) below, (a) Buyer’s liability pursuant to Section 7.3(b) above with respect to any covenant (including Buyer’s liability to fund the Purchase Price at the Closing) and Section 7.3(c) and (b) Seller’s liability pursuant to Section 7.2(a) with respect to any Fundamental Representation and Section 7.2(b) with respect to any covenant, shall, in each case, be without limit.(c)    Under no circumstances shall any Party be liable to any other Party for any indirect, contingent, consequential, unforeseen, exemplary or punitive, special Damages of any nature (including lost profits); provided, however, that any such Damages recovered by any third party for which a Party owes another Party an indemnity under this Agreement shall not be waived.(d)    The Parties will make appropriate adjustments for any insurance proceeds actually received by the Indemnified Party in determining Damages for purposes of this Article 7.  All indemnification payments under this Article 7 will be deemed to be adjustments to the amounts paid to Sellers pursuant to Article 2.  Any liability for indemnification under this Agreement shall be determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.(e)    Each Indemnified Party seeking indemnification hereunder shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Damages that it asserts under this Article 7, but any reasonable costs and expenses (other than internal costs and expenses) incurred in connection therewith shall constitute Damages.7.6    Exclusive Remedy.  IN THE ABSENCE OF FRAUD, AFTER THE CLOSING THE RIGHT OF THE PARTIES TO ASSERT INDEMNIFICATION CLAIMS AND RECEIVE INDEMNITY PAYMENTS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE RIGHT AND REMEDY EXERCISABLE BY THE PARTIES WITH RESPECT TO ANY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF ANY BREACH BY ANY PARTY OF ANY 25REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, COVENANT OR AGREEMENT OF SUCH PARTY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT OR OTHERWISE RELATING TO THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS.  NO PARTY WILL HAVE ANY OTHER REMEDY (STATUTORY, EQUITABLE, COMMON LAW OR OTHERWISE) AGAINST ANY OTHER PARTY WITH RESPECT TO SUCH MATTERS, AND ALL SUCH OTHER REMEDIES ARE HEREBY WAIVED.  WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, IN THE ABSENCE OF FRAUD, EACH OF THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT SUCH PARTY WILL NOT HAVE ANY REMEDY AFTER THE CLOSING FOR ANY BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, COVENANT OR AGREEMENT SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS ARTICLE 7.7.7    Tax Treatment.  Indemnification payments made pursuant to this Article 7 may be treated as adjustments of the Purchase Price as permitted by applicable Laws and Regulations.

The Parties may terminate this Agreement as provided below:(a)    Buyer and Sellers may terminate this Agreement by mutual written consent at any time prior to the Closing;(b)    Buyer may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the Seller Representative (i) at any time prior to the Closing in the event that any Seller has breached in any material respect any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement, Buyer has notified the Seller Representative of the breach, and the breach has continued without cure for a period of 30 days after the notice of breach or (ii) at any time following February 28, 2014 (the “Termination Date”) if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before the Termination Date;

Each Seller hereby consents and agrees to all actions or inactions taken or omitted to be taken, in each case in good faith, by the Seller Representative under this Agreement.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, including the provisions set forth in Article 7, each Seller hereby agrees to severally, and not jointly or jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Representative from and against all Damages incurred in connection with the performance of its duties under this Agreement, excluding such Damages caused by the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of the Seller Representative.  The Seller Representative shall be entitled and is hereby granted the right to set off and deduct any such unpaid, unsatisfied Damages from any amounts owed to a Seller pursuant to this Agreement.(e)    Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that the Seller Representative shall not be liable, responsible or accountable in Damages or otherwise to any Party by reason of, arising from or relating to any action taken or failure to act on behalf of Sellers, unless caused by the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of the Seller Representative.28(f)    The Seller Representative shall be fully protected in relying in good faith upon the records of Sellers and upon such information, opinions, reports or statements presented to the Seller Representative by any of its accountants, consultants, brokers, financial advisors, legal counsel and other professionals as to matters the Seller Representative reasonably believes are within such Person’s professional or expert competence.(g)    IN NO EVENT SHALL THE SELLER REPRESENTATIVE BE LIABLE, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL LOSSES OR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS), EVEN IF THE SELLERS’ REPRESENTATIVE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES OR DAMAGES REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, UNLESS CAUSED BY THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE, BAD FAITH OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF THE SELLER REPRESENTATIVE.(h)    EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY LAW, EACH SELLER UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES THAT INDEMNIFICATION PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION 9.1 SHALL INCLUDE INDEMNIFICATION FOR THE SELLER REPRESENTATIVE’S OWN NEGLIGENCE OR UNDER THEORIES OF STRICT LIABILITY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, BUT SHALL EXCLUDE INDEMNIFICATION FOR THE SELLER REPRESENTATIVE’S GROSS NEGLIGENCE, BAD FAITH OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT.  (i)    The provisions set forth in this Section 9.1 shall survive the resignation of the Seller Representative and the termination of this Agreement; provided, however, that the authorizations of the Seller Representative shall be effective only until its rights and obligations under this Agreement terminate by virtue of the termination of any and all obligations of Sellers and of Buyer under this Agreement.(j)    The appointment and grant of power and authority by each Seller under this Section 9.1 is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable and shall not be terminated by any act of such Party or by operation of law, whether by the death or incapacity of such Party or by the occurrence of any other event.9.2    Release of Seller Claims.

Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and are not alternative.10.2    Successors and Assigns.  The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns; provided, however, that no Party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the consent of the other Party.
