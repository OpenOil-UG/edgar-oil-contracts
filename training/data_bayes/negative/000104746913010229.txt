R E C I T A L S
 
A.                                    The Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the other Agents party thereto, are parties to that certain Senior Revolving Credit Agreement dated as of February 8, 2012 (as amended by the First Amendment dated July 31, 2012, the Second Amendment dated January 25, 2013, the Third Amendment dated April 26, 2013, the Fourth Amendment dated May 8, 2013, the Fifth Amendment dated June 11, 2013 and as may be further amended, restated, modified or supplemented, the Credit Agreement), pursuant to which the Lenders have made certain credit and other financial accommodations available to and on behalf of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries.
 
B.                                    The Borrower has requested and the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders have agreed to amend certain provisions of the Credit Agreement.
 
C.                                    NOW, THEREFORE, to induce the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders to enter into this Sixth Amendment and in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants herein contained, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:
 
Section 1.                                           Defined Terms.  Each capitalized term used herein but not otherwise defined herein has the meaning given such term in the Credit Agreement, as amended by this Sixth Amendment.  Unless otherwise indicated, all section references in this Sixth Amendment refer to sections of the Credit Agreement.
 
Section 2.                                           Amendments to Credit Agreement.
 
2.1                               Financial Covenants.  Section 9.01(a) of the Credit Agreement is amended, in its entirety, effective as of the Sixth Amendment Effective Date to read as follows:
 
(a)                           Interest Coverage Ratio.  The Borrower will not, as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, permit its Interest Coverage Ratio to be to be less than 2.5 to 1.0; provided that (i) for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2013, the Interest Coverage Ratio shall be calculated by utilizing EBITDA for the three month period then ended multiplied by 4; (ii) for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2014, the Interest Coverage Ratio shall be calculated by utilizing EBITDA for the
 






 
six month period then ended multiplied by 2; and (iii) for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2014, the Interest Coverage Ratio shall be calculated by utilizing EBITDA for the nine month period then ended multiplied by 4/3.
 
2.2                               Maximum Credit Amounts.  Annex I of the Credit Agreement is hereby deleted, in its entirety, effective as of the Sixth Amendment Effective Date, and replaced with Annex I attached hereto.
 
Section 3.                                                                   Increase in Borrowing Base.  As of the Sixth Amendment Effective Date, each of the Lenders and the Borrower agree that the amount of the Borrowing Base shall be $850,000,000 and such Borrowing Base shall remain in effect until the Borrowing Base is otherwise redetermined or adjusted in accordance with the Credit Agreement or Section 4 hereof.  This provision does not limit the right of the parties to initiate interim redeterminations of the Borrowing Base in accordance with Section 2.07(b) or further adjustments pursuant to Section 2.07(e), Section 2.07(f), Section 8.13(c) or Section 9.13.  The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the Borrowing Base redetermination set forth in this Section 3 shall be deemed to be the Scheduled Redetermination scheduled for November 1, 2013 as provided in Section 2.07(b). This Section 3 constitutes the New Borrowing Base Notice in accordance with Section 2.07(d).

(the Subject Disposition).  Upon the consummation of the Subject Disposition, each of the Lenders and the Borrower agree that the amount of the Borrowing Base shall be automatically reduced so that the amount of the Borrowing Base shall be $800,000,000 and such Borrowing Base shall remain in effect until the Borrowing Base is otherwise redetermined or adjusted in accordance with the Credit Agreement.  The Lenders hereby agree that the reduction in the Borrowing Base pursuant to this Section 4 shall satisfy the requirements of Section 9.13(e)(iii) insofar as such requirements apply to the Subject Disposition and no waiver, consent or additional reduction of the Borrowing Base shall be required in connection with the Subject Disposition.  This provision does not limit the right of the parties to initiate (a) interim redeterminations of the Borrowing Base in accordance with Section 2.07(b), (b) further adjustments pursuant to Section 2.07(e), Section 2.07(f) or Section 8.13(c), or (c) adjustments pursuant to Section 9.13 not made in connection with the Subject Disposition.
 
Section 5.                                           Conditions Precedent.  This Sixth Amendment shall become effective on the date when the Administrative Agent shall have received a counterpart of this Sixth Amendment signed by the Borrower, the Guarantors and each of the Lenders and each of the following conditions is satisfied (or waived in accordance with Section 12.02 of the Credit Agreement) (such date, the Sixth Amendment Effective Date):
 
At the time of and immediately after giving effect to this Sixth Amendment, (i) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and (ii) no event or events shall have occurred which individually or in the aggregate could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
The Administrative Agent is hereby authorized and directed to declare this Sixth Amendment to be effective when it has received documents confirming or certifying, to the
 






 
satisfaction of the Administrative Agent, compliance with the conditions set forth in this Section 5 or the waiver of such conditions as permitted in Section 12.02 of the Credit Agreement.  Such declaration shall be final, conclusive and binding upon all parties to the Credit Agreement for all purposes.

6.5                               NO ORAL AGREEMENT.  THIS SIXTH AMENDMENT, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS EXECUTED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH AND THEREWITH REPRESENT THE FINAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS, OR UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES.  THERE ARE NO ORAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTIES.

6.7                               Severability.  Any provision of this Sixth Amendment which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any
 






 
such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.
 
6.8                               Successors and Assigns.  This Sixth Amendment shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.
