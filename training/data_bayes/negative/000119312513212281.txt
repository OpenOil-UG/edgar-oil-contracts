such Indebtedness or other obligation in respect of such Swap Agreement (or any guarantee thereof) is or becomes illegal under the Commodity Exchange Act or any rule, regulation or order of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (or the
application or official interpretation of any thereof) by virtue of such Loan Partys failure for any reason to constitute an Eligible Contract Participant at the time such guarantee or grant of a security interest is entered into or otherwise
becomes effective with respect to, or any other time such Loan Party is by virtue of such guarantee or grant of security interest otherwise deemed to enter into, such Indebtedness or other obligation in respect of such Swap Agreement (or guarantee
thereof). If such an obligation arises under a master agreement governing more than one swap, such exclusion shall apply only to the portion of such obligation that is attributable to swaps the guarantee or grant of security interest for which (or

from time to time by each Benefitting Guarantor in order for such Benefitting Guarantor to honor its obligations (without giving effect to Section 8.17(b)) under the Guaranty Agreement and any other Security Instrument including obligations
with respect to Swap Agreements (provided, however, that the Borrower shall only be liable under this Section 8.17(a) for the maximum amount of such liability that can be hereby incurred without rendering its obligations under this
Section 8.17(a), or otherwise under this Agreement or any Loan Document, as it relates to such Benefitting Guarantor, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not for any greater
amount). The obligations of the Borrower under this Section 8.17(a) shall remain in full force and effect until all Indebtedness is paid in full to the Lenders, the Administrative Agent and all other Secured Parties, and all of the
Lenders Commitments are terminated. The Borrower intends that this Section 8.17(a) constitute, and this Section 8.17(a) shall be deemed to constitute, a keepwell, support, or other agreement for the benefit
of each Benefitting Guarantor for all purposes of Section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the Commodity Exchange Act. 
(b) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, Indebtedness guaranteed by any
Guarantor, or secured by the grant of any Lien by such Guarantor under any Security Instrument, shall exclude all Excluded Swap Obligations with respect to such Guarantor.  2.5 Amendment to Section 9.18 of the Credit Agreement. Section 9.18 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows: 
(a) The Borrower will not, and will not permit any other Loan Party to, enter into any Swap Agreements with any Person
other than:  (i) Swap Agreements in respect of commodities (A) with an Approved Counterparty and
(B) the notional volumes for which (when aggregated with other commodity Swap Agreements then in effect other than basis differential swaps on volumes already hedged pursuant to other Swap Agreements) do not exceed, as of the date such Swap
Agreement is executed, 85% of the reasonably anticipated projected production from proved Oil and Gas Properties included in the most recent Reserve Report for each month during the period during which such Swap Agreement is in effect for each of
crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, which may be hedged with Swap Agreements for crude oil, each calculated separately; provided that Proved Developed Non-Producing Reserves and Proved Undeveloped Reserves, in the aggregate, do not
account for greater than 25% of the total Proved Reserves, 
   Page 5






 (ii) Swap Agreements that would be permitted by clause (i) hereof
pertaining to Oil and Gas Properties to be acquired pursuant to a Specified Acquisition; provided that Swap Agreements pursuant to this Section 9.18(b) must be Liquidated upon the earlier to occur of: (A) the date that is 90 days after the
execution of the purchase and sale agreement relating to the Specified Acquisition to the extent that such Specified Acquisition has not been consummated by such date, (B) any Loan Party knows with reasonable certainty that the Specified
Acquisition will not be consummated, and (C) in the case of the WHT Acquisition, the date that is 30 days following the date any Loan Party enters into any such Swap Agreement with respect to the expected production from the Oil and Gas
Properties to be acquired in the WHT Acquisition if, as of such date, no binding and enforceable purchase and sale agreement has been signed by a Loan Party with respect to the WHT Acquisition, 
(iii) Swap Agreements in respect of interest rates with an Approved Counterparty, as follows: (A) Swap Agreements
effectively converting interest rates from fixed to floating, the notional amounts of which (when aggregated with all other Swap Agreements of the Loan Parties then in effect effectively converting interest rates from fixed to floating) do not
exceed 100% of the then outstanding principal amount of the Loan Parties Debt for borrowed money which bears interest at a fixed rate and (B) Swap Agreements effectively converting interest rates from floating to fixed, the notional
amounts of which (when aggregated with all other Swap Agreements of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties then in effect effectively converting interest rates from floating to fixed) do not exceed 100% of the then outstanding principal amount of
the Loan Parties Debt for borrowed money which bears interest at a floating rate, and  (iv) Swap
Agreements entered into in the ordinary course of the Loan Parties business in respect of Emission Credits; provided that the aggregate amount that is owing but unpaid by the Loan Parties under all such Swap Agreements shall not exceed
$1,000,000 in the aggregate at any time.  (b) In no event shall any Swap Agreement contain any requirement,
agreement or covenant for a Loan Party to post collateral or margin to secure their obligations under such Swap Agreement or to cover market exposures, except to the extent permitted under Section 9.03(e). 
(c) The Borrower will not, and will not permit any of the other Loan Parties to, incur or permit to exist any speculative
Swap Agreements.  (d) The Borrower will not, and will not permit any other Loan Party to, Liquidate any Swap
Agreement in respect of commodities unless (x) if such Swap Liquidation would result in an automatic redetermination of the Borrowing Base pursuant to Section 2.07(f), the Borrower delivers reasonable prior written notice thereof to the
Administrative Agent, and (y) if a Borrowing Base Deficiency would result from such Swap Liquidation as a result of an automatic redetermination of the Borrowing Base pursuant to Section 2.07(f), the Borrower

Amendment to Guaranty Agreement. Effective as of the Fourth Amendment Effective Date, a new Section 28 is hereby added to the Guaranty Agreement immediately following
Section 27 thereof, which Section 28 shall read in full as follows:  28. (a) Each Guarantor that is a
Qualified ECP Guarantor hereby guarantees the payment and performance of all Indebtedness of each Benefitting Guarantor and absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to provide such funds or other support as may be needed from time to
time by each Benefitting Guarantor in order for such Benefitting Guarantor to honor its obligations (without giving effect to Section 28(b)) under this Guaranty and any other Security Instrument, including obligations with respect to Swap
Agreements (provided, however, that each such Guarantor shall only be liable under this Section 28(a) for the maximum amount of such liability that can be hereby incurred without rendering its obligations under this Section 28(a), or
otherwise under this Guaranty or any Loan Document, as it relates to such Benefitting Guarantors, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not for any greater amount). The obligations of each such
Guarantor under this Section 28(a) shall remain in full force and effect until (i) all Indebtedness is paid in full to the Lenders, the Administrative Agent and all other Secured Parties, and all of the Lenders Commitments are
terminated or (ii) the termination of this Guaranty with respect to such Guarantor in accordance with its terms. The parties intend that this Section 28(a) constitute, and this Section 28(a) shall be deemed to constitute, a
keepwell, support, or other agreement for the 
   Page 7






 
benefit of each other Loan Party for all purposes of Section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the Commodity Exchange Act. 
(b) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, Indebtedness guaranteed by any
Guarantor, or secured by the grant of any security interest by such Guarantor under any Security Instrument, shall exclude all Excluded Swap Obligations with respect to such Guarantor. 
Section 5. Representations and Warranties; Etc. Each Loan Party hereby affirms: (a) that as of the date hereof, all of
the representations and warranties contained in each Loan Document to which such Loan Party is a party are true and correct in all material respects as though made on and as of the date hereof (unless made as of a specific earlier date, in which
case, was true as of such date), (b) no Defaults exist under the Loan Documents or will, after giving effect to this Fourth Amendment, exist under the Loan Documents and (c) no Material Adverse Effect has occurred.
