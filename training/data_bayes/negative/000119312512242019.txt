reallocate items of cost in or change the Approved Budget without the prior written consent of Lender.  E.
Disbursement of Loan Proceeds. The Borrower and Lender agree, anything herein or in the other Loan Documents to the contrary notwithstanding, that the Lender shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to advance the proceeds of
the Loan in installments, from time to time, as, in the opinion of the Lender, funds are needed by the Borrower for the purposes herein expressed; and the Lender reserves the right in its discretion to advance only such part of said Loan proceeds as
it deems best, and to discontinue making such Advances to the Borrower if, in its discretion, further or additional Advances shall seem to it unjustified, unwise or undesirable or if it deems itself insecure; and said Loan Documents shall be and
remain valid and binding as security for the aggregate amount advanced at any time, whether or not the full amount of said Loan is Advanced. Lender will use its best efforts to make a requested disbursement within ten (10) days after

result of any fire, explosion, accident, flood or other casualty.  H. Work in Accordance with Plans. The
Borrower agrees to proceed with diligence to construct the Improvements called for by the Plans and the Construction Contract, a copy of which Plans and Construction Contract have been delivered to the Lender, and Borrower further agrees that said
construction work shall be done strictly in accordance with Plans and Construction Contract as approved by the Lender, and with all applicable Governmental Requirements. The Plans and the Construction Contract heretofore delivered to, and
approved by, the Lender may not be materially changed, altered or added to without the prior written consent of Lender. 
I. Disbursements. Inspections shall be made by a representative of Lender for all disbursements. At no time
and in no event shall Lender be obligated to disburse funds in excess of the amount recommended by Lenders agent or the Inspecting Architects/Engineers; or if any Event of Default shall have occurred; or if Lender is unsatisfied with the
progress of construction; or, if in the sole opinion of Lender, the estimated remaining cost of construction in accordance with the Plans exceeds the remaining undisbursed portion of the Loan proceeds; or if any Improvements shall have been damaged
by fire or other casualty and Lender shall not have received insurance proceeds sufficient in the sole judgment of Lender to effect the restoration of the Improvements to the condition immediately preceding such damage and in accordance with the
Plans, if applicable, and permit the completion of the Improvements on or before the scheduled completion date. It is understood that any sum or sums required for the construction of the Improvements over and above the proceeds of the Loan herein
agreed to be made shall be advanced by, and be the sole responsibility of, Borrower.  J. Remedies of
Lender. Upon the occurrence of any Even of Default, and after the expiration of any applicable cure period, Lender shall at its option be entitled, in addition to and not in lieu of the remedies provided in the Agreement and

disbursed (including any retainage) to the extent necessary to complete construction of the Improvements in accordance with Plans and Construction Contract, and if the completion requires a larger sum than the remaining undisbursed portion of the
Loan, to disburse such additional funds, all of which funds so disbursed by Lender shall be deemed to have been disbursed to Borrower and shall be secured by the Security Documents. For this purpose, Borrower hereby constitutes and appoints Lender
its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full power of substitution to complete the construction of the Improvements in the name of the Borrower, and hereby empowers Lender as said attorney to take all actions necessary in connection therewith
including any Escrow and any funds which may remain unadvanced under the Loan for the purpose of completing the Improvements in the manner called for by the Plans; to make such additions and changes and corrections in the Plans which shall be
necessary or desirable to complete the Improvements in substantially the manner contemplated by the Plans; to employ such contractors, subcontractors, agents, architects, and inspectors as shall be required for said purposes; to pay, settle or
compromise all existing or future bills and claims which are or may be liens against said Commercial Land, or may be necessary or desirable for the completion of the Improvements or the clearance of the title to the Commercial Land; to execute all
applications and certificates in the name of Borrower which may be required by any construction contract and to do any and every act with respect to the construction of the Improvements and to take such action and require such performance as it
deems necessary. In accordance therewith Borrower hereby assigns and quitclaims to Lender all sums to be advanced hereunder including retainage and any sums in escrow conditioned upon the use of said sums, if any, for the completion of the
Improvements; and/or  6. Take any other action that Lender, in its sole discretion, deems necessary or
advisable under the circumstances to protect and preserve the Collateral. Borrower agrees to immediately reimburse Lender for all costs incurred to protect and preserve the Collateral .

Commercial Land during normal business hours with 24 hours notice and to inspect the Improvements and all materials to be used in the construction thereof and to cooperate and cause Contractor to cooperate with Lender and its representatives and
agents during such inspections; provided, however, that this provision shall not be deemed to impose upon Lender any duty or obligation whatsoever to undertake such inspection, to correct any defects in the Improvements or to notify any person with
respect thereto.  L. Correction of Defects. Borrower agrees to promptly correct any structural defect in
the Improvements and to promptly correct any departure from the Plans not previously approved by Lender. An Advance shall not constitute a waiver of Lenders right to require compliance with this, or any other, covenant.

 M. General Conditions. The following conditions shall be applicable
throughout the term of the Agreement:  1. Rights of Third Parties. All conditions of the obligations of Lender
hereunder, including the obligation to make Advances, are imposed solely and exclusively for the benefit of Borrower and Borrowers successors and assigns and no other person shall have standing to require satisfaction of such conditions in
accordance with their terms or be entitled to assume that Lender will refuse to make advances in the absence of strict compliance with any or all thereof and no other person shall, under any circumstances, be deemed to be a beneficiary of such
conditions, any and all of which may be freely waived in whole or in part by the Lender at any time if in its sole discretion it deems it desirable to do so. In particular, Lender makes no representations and assumes no duties or obligations as to
third parties concerning the quality of the construction by Borrower or the Improvements or the absence therefrom of defects. In this connection, Borrower agrees to and shall indemnify Lender from any liability, claims or losses resulting from the
disbursement of the Loan proceeds or from the condition of the Improvements whether related to the quality of construction or otherwise and whether arising during or after the term of the Loan. This provision shall survive the repayment of said Loan
and shall continue in full force and effect so long as the possibility of such liability, claims, or losses exists.  2. Evidence of Satisfaction of Conditions. Any condition of this Construction Rider which requires the submission of evidence of the existence or nonexistence of a specified fact or facts implies as a
condition the existence or nonexistence, as the case may be, of such fact or facts, and Lender shall, at all times, be free to independently establish to its satisfaction and in its absolute discretion such existence or nonexistence. 
N. Advances Do Not Constitute a Waiver. No Advance shall constitute a waiver of the conditions of Lenders
obligation to make further Advances nor, in the event Borrower is unable to satisfy any such condition, shall any such waiver have the effect of precluding Lender from thereafter declaring such inability to be a Default. In addition, any waiver of
any provision of the Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of any other provision, and shall not act as a future waiver of any provision of the Agreement.  0. Compliance With Federal Law. Borrower will ensure that each Contractor complies with Executive Order 11246, entitled Equal Employment Opportunity, as amended by
Executive Order 11375, and as supplemented by applicable Department of Labor Regulations (41 CFR, Part 60). Failure of the Contractor to comply with these laws will be an Event of Default. 
P. Cost Overruns. Borrower will not allow any change and/or cost overrun on any contract or other commitment which
will result in an additional cash flow expenditure and/or debt to the business and/or request for a subsequent loan, either guaranteed or not, without the express written approval of RBS. In no event will a subsequent Business &
Industry Guaranteed Loan be approved to cover such costs. Furthermore, Borrower will not divert Loan funds from purposes identified in Section 2.2 of this Agreement for any of the aforementioned items without the express written approval of
RBS. Failure to comply with the terms of this paragraph will be considered a material adverse change in the Borrowers financial condition and a default under the Loan. In the event any of the aforementioned increases in costs and/or expenses
are incurred by the Borrower, the Borrower must provide for such increases in a manner that there is no diminution of the Borrowers operating capital.

be used for the purposes specified in the Loan Documents. Such Loan and Escrow will not be used directly or indirectly for personal, family, household or agricultural purposes or for the purposes of purchasing or carrying any Margin Stock or for the

Note No. 273725





$10,000,000.00
  

  
September             , 2008
 FOR VALUE RECEIVED, Lazarus Energy LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (hereinafter referred
to as Maker), hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the order of 1st International Bank (Payee) at 1912 Avenue K, Plano, Texas 75074, or at such other address given to Maker by Payee, the principal sum of TEN
MILLION AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($10,000,000.00), in lawful money of the United States of America, together with interest per annum (calculated on the basis of a 360-day year) on the unpaid principal balance from day-to-day remaining, computed from
the date of advance until maturity at the rate equal to the lesser of (a) the Maximum Rate (as hereinafter defined) or (b) Prime Rate (as hereafter defined) plus two and one quarter percent (P +2.25 %)*. The interest rate as of the
date hereof is 7.25%. Principal and interest under this note (the Note) are due and payable as follows:  Initial
monthly payment of principal and interest shall be due and payable in the amount of Eighty Thousand One Hundred Thirty-Nine and 73/100 Dollars ($80,139.73), with the first such installment due on the
            day of                 , 2008. Monthly payments shall continue to be due and payable on the same
day of each calendar month thereafter until                 , 2028 (the  Maturity Date), when all unpaid principal and unpaid interest shall be due and payable in full. Monthly payments shall be increased or decreased based on the changes in interest rate to ensure
that the entire loan balance is paid in full on the final Maturity Date.   


*
The interest rate will adjust on the first day of each calendar quarter (the Adjustment Date) to a rate equal to TWO AND ONE QUARTER PERCENT
(2.25%) per annum (on the basis of actual days elapsed over a 360-day year) above the minimum prime lending rate charged by large U.S. money center commercial banks as published from time to time in the Money Rates Section of the Wall Street
Journal (Prime Rate), each change in the rate charged hereunder to become effective without notice to the undersigned as of the Adjustment Date, but in no event shall the rate charged hereunder exceed the Maximum Rate (as
hereafter defined). The undersigned understand and acknowledge that Payee may from time to time make various loans at rates of interest having no relationship to the Prime Rate, and that the Prime Rate may not be the lowest interest rate charged for
loans by Payee. In the event the Wall Street Journal is no longer published or in the event the Wall Street Journal discontinues publishing a Prime Rate, the Prime Rate shall be the nearest comparable published rate, as determined by the
holder of this Note. 
  









PROMISSORY NOTE
 
PAGE 1
 






 The term Maximum Rate,  as used herein, shall mean, with respect to each holder
hereof, the maximum nonusurious interest rate, if any, that at any time, or from time to time, may under applicable law be contracted for, taken, reserved, charged or received on the indebtedness evidenced by this Note under the laws which are
presently in effect of the United States and the State of Texas applicable to such holder and such indebtedness or, to the extent allowed by law under such applicable laws of the United States of America and the State of Texas which may hereafter be
in effect, which allow a higher maximum non-usurious interest rate than applicable laws now allow; provided, that in determining the Maximum Rate, due regard shall be given, to the extent required by applicable law, to any and all relevant payments,
fees, charges, deposits, balances, agreements and calculations which may constitute or be deemed to constitute interest, or be deducted from principal to calculate the interest rate or otherwise affect interest rate determinations, so that in no
event shall the Payee contract for, charge, receive, take, collect, reserve or apply, on the Note, any amount in excess of the maximum non-usurious rate of interest permitted by applicable law. To the extent that Texas law determines the Maximum
Rate, the Maximum Rate shall be determined by utilizing the indicated rate ceiling from time to time in effect pursuant to the Texas Finance Code (V.T.C. A. Finance Code Section 303.001 et seq.) (the Texas Finance Code)
or such successor statute, as then in effect, governing usury. The Maximum Rate shall not be limited to the applicable rate ceiling in the Texas Finance Code or such successor statute if Federal laws or other state laws now or hereafter in effect
and applicable to this Note (and the interest contracted for, charged and collected hereunder) shall permit a higher rate of interest.  Maker and Payee intend to comply with the applicable law governing the Maximum Rate. Interest contracted for, charged, or received shall not exceed the Maximum Rate, and, if in any contingency whatsoever,
Payee shall receive anything of value deemed interest under applicable law which would cause the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the holder thereof to exceed the maximum amount of interest permissible under applicable law, the
excessive interest shall be applied to the reduction of the unpaid principal balance hereof and not to the payment of interest, or if such excessive interest exceeds the unpaid principal balance hereof such excess shall be refunded to Maker, and the
provisions of this Note and any demand on Maker shall immediately be deemed reformed and the amounts thereafter collectible hereunder shall be reduced, without the necessity of the execution of any new documents, so as to comply with the applicable
law, but so as to permit the recovery of the fullest amount otherwise called for hereunder. All interest paid or agreed to be paid to the holder hereof shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, shall be amortized, prorated, allocated, and
spread throughout the full term of such indebtedness until payment in full (including the period of any renewal or extension hereof) so that the rate or amount of interest on account of such indebtedness does not exceed the Maximum Rate. 
As of the seventh anniversary of this Note, should the outstanding principal amount due hereunder be greater than $7,850,000.00, Maker
will make a one-time principal reduction in an amount sufficient to reduce the principal balance to $7,850,000.00 (the Required Principal Reduction). The Required Principal Reduction will be subject to the Prepayment Consideration (as
hereinafter defined). 
  









PROMISSORY NOTE
 
PAGE 2
 






 Maker agrees to pay a late charge of five percent (5%) of the payment amount if such
payment is not received within ten (10) days of the due date. Payments, when made, shall be applied in a manner and order according to the sole discretion of the holder of this Note. 
All past-due principal and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, past-due interest upon this Note shall bear interest at the
Maximum Rate.  Remittances in payment of any part of this Note other than in the required amount in immediately available
funds at the place where this Note is payable shall not, regardless of any receipt or credit issued therefor, constitute payment until the required amount is actually received by Payee in full accordance herewith and shall be made and accepted
subject to the condition that any check or draft may be handled for collection in accordance with the practice of the collecting bank or banks. Acceptance by Payee of any payment in an amount less than the full amount then due shall be deemed an
acceptance on account only, and the failure to pay the entire amount then due shall be and continue to be a Default (hereinafter defined).  This Note is secured in part by a Deed of Trust (with Security Agreement and Assignment of Rents), which together with all other documents evidencing, securing or pertaining to the transaction in which
the indebtedness evidenced hereby is incurred are collectively referred to as the Loan Documents .  Maker and each
surety, endorser, guarantor and other party ever liable for payment of any sums of money payable on this Note, jointly and severally waive presentment, protest, notice of protest and nonpayment, notice of default and notice of acceleration and
intention to accelerate, and agree that their liability under this Note shall not be affected by any renewal or extension in the time of payment hereof, or in any indulgences, or by any release or change in any security for the payment of this Note,
and hereby consent to any and all renewals, extensions, indulgences, releases or changes, regardless of the number of such renewals, extensions, indulgences, releases or changes. 
If this Note or any Loan Documents are given by Payee to an attorney for collection or enforcement, or if suit is brought for collection
or enforcement, or if it is collected or enforced through probate, bankruptcy, or other judicial proceeding, then Maker shall pay Payee all costs of collection and enforcement, including reasonable attorneys fees and court costs, in addition
to other amounts due.  No waiver by Payee of any of its rights or remedies under this Note or any Loan Documents, shall be
considered a waiver of any other right or remedy of Payee; no delay or omission in the exercise or enforcement by Payee of any rights or remedies shall ever be construed as a waiver of any right or remedy of Payee; and no exercise or enforcement of
any such rights or remedies shall ever be held to exhaust any right or remedy of Payee.

 Maker agrees that in the event any portion of this Note is prepaid in whole or in part prior
to the Maturity Date, so as to constitute a Prepayment, consideration will be tendered with the prepayment to the Payee (Prepayment Consideration) based upon the following schedule: 
Ten percent (10.0 %) of the outstanding loan principal balance prepaid if prepaid during the first Loan Year. 
Nine percent (9.0%) of the outstanding loan principal balance prepaid if prepaid during the second Loan Year. 
Eight percent (8.0%) of the outstanding loan principal balance prepaid if prepaid during the third Loan Year. 
Seven percent (7.0%) of the outstanding loan principal balance prepaid if prepaid during the fourth Loan Year. 
Six percent (6.0%) of the outstanding loan principal balance prepaid if prepaid during the fifth Loan Year. 
Five percent (5.0%) of the outstanding loan principal balance prepaid if prepaid during the sixth Loan Year. 
Four percent (4.0 %) of the outstanding loan principal balance prepaid if prepaid during the seventh Loan Year. 
Three percent (3.0%) of the outstanding loan principal balance prepaid if prepaid during the eighth Loan Year. 
Two percent (2.0%) of the outstanding loan principal balance prepaid if prepaid during the ninth Loan Year. 
One percent (1.0%) of the outstanding loan principal balance prepaid if prepaid during the tenth Loan Year. 
It is understood and agreed that a Prepayment shall be any principal payment on this Note other than scheduled monthly
payments of principal and interest as provided under this Note. A Loan Year is defined as the twelve (12) month period commencing on the date of this Note or any consecutive twelve (12) month period during the term hereof.
 Maker acknowledges that the Prepayment Consideration is consideration to Payee for the privilege of prepaying the
indebtedness evidenced by this Note prior to maturity, and Maker recognizes that Payee would incur substantial additional costs and expenses in the event of a prepayment of the indebtedness evidenced by this Note and that the Prepayment
Consideration compensates Payee for such costs and expenses (including without limitation, the loss of Payees investment opportunity during the period from the date of prepayment until the Maturity Date). 
  









PROMISSORY NOTE

 Maker agrees that Payee shall not, as a condition to receiving the Prepayment Consideration,
be obligated to actually reinvest the amount prepaid in any manner whatsoever.  Default shall mean any one or more
of the following: (i) the failure by Maker to pay any installment of principal or interest under this Note when due, (ii) the failure by Maker to pay all sums owed to Payee under this Note and every Loan Document on or before the Maturity
Date, or (iii) the occurrence of any Event of Default under the Loan Documents.  Upon the occurrence of a Default, Payee
may, at its option, without notice or demand, declare the unpaid principal balance of, and the accrued but unpaid interest on this Promissory Note immediately due and payable and exercise and pursue any and all other rights and remedies as provided
herein or in any of the Loan Documents.  Upon the occurrence of a Default, Payee is hereby authorized at any time and from
time to time, without notice to Maker (any such notice being expressly waived by each such Maker), to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held, and other indebtedness at any
time owing, by the Payee to or for the credit or the account of Maker, against any and all obligations of such Maker now or hereafter existing under this Note, irrespective of whether or not Payee shall have made demand under this Note and although
such obligations may be contingent and unmatured. The rights of the Payee under this section are in addition to all other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of offset) which Payee may have hereunder or under any
applicable law.  All obligations, covenants, and terms of payment are expressly performable solely in Collin County, Texas.
The substantive laws of the State of Texas shall govern the validity, construction, enforcement and interpretation of this Note. In the event of a dispute involving this Note or any of the Loan Documents, the undersigned irrevocably agrees that
venue for such dispute shall lie in any court of competent jurisdiction in Collin County, Texas.
