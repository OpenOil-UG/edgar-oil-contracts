forfeiture with respect to such Bonus or other payment lapses. Unless otherwise specifically provided for in this Agreement or a plan, policy or program of the Company, Employee must be employed by the Company or an Affiliate on the date the Bonus
or other payment is made to be entitled to receive the Bonus or other payment.

(ii)
Limited Notice and Opportunity to Cure. If the Company determines in its reasonable, good faith discretion that a cure is possible and appropriate, the Company will give Employee written notice of the acts or
omissions constituting Cause and no termination of this Agreement shall be for Cause unless and until Employee fails to cure such acts or omissions within 10 days following receipt of such written notice. If the Company determines in its reasonable,
good faith discretion that a cure is not possible and appropriate, Employee shall have no notice or cure rights before this Agreement is terminated for Cause.   


 
(d)
Without Cause. The Company shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement for any reason other than death, Employee becoming Permanently Disabled, or Cause, at any time by providing 90 days written notice to

existence of the condition(s) giving rise to Good Reason, and that notice shall describe the condition(s) believed to constitute Good Reason. The Company shall have 30 days to remedy the Good Reason condition(s). If not remedied within that 30-day
period, Employee may terminate this Agreement; provided, however, that such termination must occur no later than 180 days after the date of the initial existence of the condition(s) giving rise to the Good Reason; otherwise, Employee is
deemed to have accepted the condition(s), or the Companys correction of such condition(s), that may have given rise to the existence of Good Reason.

Employee pays to effect and continue such coverage and the employee contribution amount that active senior executive employees of the Company pay for the same or similar coverage. 
 


 
(c)
Effect of a Change in Control Following Date of Termination. Notwithstanding any contrary provision in this Agreement, if this Agreement is terminated by the Company without Cause in accordance with subparagraph
6(d) or by Employee for Good Reason in accordance with subparagraph 6(e), and a CIC Effective Date occurs within 120 days following the Date of Termination, then, in addition to the severance payments and benefits provided to Employee in accordance
with subparagraph 7(d), the Company shall provide Employee (or to Employees estate in the event of his death following the Date of Termination) with the following Change in Control payments: 
 


 
(i)
on or before the 60th day following the CIC Effective Date, a lump sum in cash equal to the excess, if any, of (A) the Change of Control payment that Employee would have been entitled to receive under subparagraph
8(b)(i) if he was employed by the Company or an Affiliate on the CIC Effective Date, over (B) the severance payment payable to Employee in accordance with subparagraph 7(d)(i); and

9.
 Parachute Payment Limitation. Notwithstanding any contrary provision in this Agreement, if Employee is a disqualified
individual (as defined in Section 280G of the Code), and the Change in Control payments and benefits described in paragraph 8, together with any other payments which Employee has the right to receive from the Company, would constitute
a parachute payment (as defined in Section 280G of the Code), the payments and benefits provided hereunder shall be either (a) reduced (but not 
   AMENDED
AND RESTATED EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT - Page 11 








 

below zero) so that the aggregate present value of such payments and benefits received by Employee from the Company shall be $1.00 less than three times Employees base
amount (as defined in Section 280G of the Code) and so that no portion of such payments received by Employee shall be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, or (b) paid in full, whichever produces the
better net after-tax result for Employee (taking into account any applicable excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code and any applicable income tax). The determination as to whether any such reduction in the amount of the payments and benefits
is necessary shall be made by the Company in good faith and such determination shall be conclusive and binding on Employee. If a reduced payment is made to Employee pursuant to clause (a) above and through error or otherwise that payment, when
aggregated with other payments from the Company (or its affiliates) used in determining if a parachute payment exists, exceeds $1.00 less than three times Employees base amount, Employee shall immediately repay such excess to the Company upon
notification that an overpayment has been made.   


10.
Conditions on Receipt of Severance and Change-in-Control Benefits.   


 
(a)
Compliance with Post-Termination Obligations and Execution and Non-Revocation of General Release Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, the Companys payment to Employee of the
severance payments and benefits described in subparagraphs 7(b)(i), 7(d)(i)-(ii), and 7(e)(i) or the Change in Control payments and benefits described in subparagraphs 8(b)(i)-(ii) and 8(c)(i)-(ii) is subject to the condition that he
complies with all applicable covenants under paragraphs 12, 13, 14, and 15 of this Agreement. The Company shall have the right to cease payment of any such payments or benefits, as well as to seek restitution of any such payments or benefits already
paid, if such covenants have been breached by Employee but all other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The Companys payment of such payments or benefits to Employee is also subject to the condition that,
within 55 days after the Date of Termination, he execute, deliver to the Company, and not revoke as permitted by applicable law a General Release Agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company that fully and finally releases and waives any
and all claims, demands, actions, and suits whatsoever which he has or may have against the Company and its Affiliates, whether under this Agreement or otherwise, that arose before the General Release Agreement was executed (the
Release). For purposes of this Agreement, the Release shall not become fully enforceable and irrevocable until Employee has timely executed the Release and not revoked his acceptance of the Release within seven days after its
execution.   


 
(b)
 Separation from Service Requirement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Employee shall be entitled to the severance or
Change in Control benefits and payments in subparagraphs 7(b), 7(d), 7(e), or 8(b) only if Employees termination of employment constitutes a Separation from Service. For purposes of this Agreement, Separation from Service
means separation from service (within the meaning of Code Section 409A and the regulations and other guidance promulgated thereunder (Section 409A)) with the group of

employers that includes the Company and each of its Affiliates. For this purpose, Affiliate means any incorporated or unincorporated trade or business or other entity or
person, other than the Company, that along with the Company is considered a single employer under Code Section 414(b) or Code Section 414(c), but (i) in applying Code Section 1563(a)(1), (2), and (3) for the purposes of
determining a controlled group of corporations under Code Section 414(b), the phrase at least 50 percent shall be used instead of the phrase at least 80 percent in each place the phrase at least 80 percent
appears in Code Section 1563(a)(1), (2), and (3), and (ii) in applying Treasury Regulation Section 1.414(c)-2 for the purposes of determining trades or businesses (whether or not incorporated) that are under common control for the
purposes of Code Section 414(c), the phrase at least 50 percent shall be used instead of the phrase at least 80 percent in each place the phrase at least 80 percent appears in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.414(c)-2.   


11.

and acceptable to Employee and do not import any greater restraint than is reasonably necessary to protect the Companys goodwill, Confidential Information, and other legitimate business interests. Employee further agrees that if, at some later

violation, or threatened breach or violation. The Company may pursue any remedy available to it concurrently or consecutively in any order as to any breach, violation, or threatened breach or violation, and the pursuit of one of such remedies at any
time shall not be deemed an election of remedies or waiver of the right to pursue any other of such remedies as to such breach, violation, or threatened breach or violation, or as to any other breach, violation, or threatened breach or violation.

death, this Agreement shall be enforceable by Employees estate, executors, or legal representatives. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective heirs, legal representatives, successors,

28.

29.
Code Section 409A.   


 
(a)
Intent. All or a portion of the payments and benefits provided under this Agreement is intended to be exempt from Section 409A and any ambiguous provision will be construed in a manner that is compliant with
or exempt from the application of Section 409A. In particular, such payments and benefits are intended to constitute short-term deferrals described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) or a payment or benefit described in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(v). The provisions of this Agreement shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with this intent.   


 
(b)
Specified Employee Postponement. Notwithstanding subparagraph (a) of this paragraph or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if the Company or an Affiliate that is treated as a
service recipient (as defined in Section 409A) is publicly traded on an established securities market (or otherwise) and Employee is a specified employee (as defined below) and is entitled to receive a
payment that is subject to Section 409A on account of Employees Separation from Service, such payment may not be made earlier than six months following the date of his Separation from Service if required by Section 409A, in which
case, the accumulated postponed amount shall be paid in a lump sum payment on the Section 409A Payment Date. The Section 409A Payment Date is the earlier of (i) the date of Employees death or (ii) the date
that is six months and one day after Employees Separation from Service. If any payment to Employee is delayed pursuant to the foregoing sentence, such amount instead will be paid, with interest at the rate set out in Section 11(d), on the
Section 409A Payment Date. For purposes of Section 409A, each payment amount or benefit due under this Agreement will be considered a separate payment and Employees entitlement to a series of payments or benefits under this Agreement
is to be treated as an entitlement to a series of separate payments. The determination of whether Employee is a specified employee shall be made in accordance with Section 409A using the default provisions in the Section 409A
unless another permitted method has been prescribed for such purpose by the Company.   


30.
 Right to Consult a Tax Advisor. Notwithstanding any contrary provision in this Agreement, Employee shall be solely responsible for any risk
that the tax treatment of all or part of any payments provided by this Agreement may be affected by Section 409A, which may impose significant adverse tax consequences on him, including accelerated

   AMENDED
AND RESTATED EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT - Page 21 








 

taxation, a 20% additional tax, and interest. Because of the potential tax consequences, Employee has the right, and is encouraged by this paragraph, to consult with a tax advisor of his choice
before signing this Agreement.  [Signature Page Follows]
