 (b) General Terms.   
(i) Payout multiples between the numbers 0 and 200 on the chart in Section 6(a) above will be calculated using straight-line interpolation. 
(ii) Any Award that is earned will be settled in the form of shares of Stock and granted pursuant to the Plan.  The number of shares of Stock to be granted to you shall be calculated by dividing the value of the earned Award (your Total Performance Score expressed as a percentage times your Target Award) divided by the closing price of the Stock as of the trading day immediately

preceding the date the Award is settled (adjusted for taxes pursuant to Section 10 hereof and rounded down to the next whole number). The resulting shares of Stock will be granted to you as soon as practicable after the Committee has certified the applicable Performance Goals were achieved for the Performance Period, but in no event later than the seventy-fifth (75th) day following the date the Performance Period ends. Any remaining value of the earned Award will be paid to you in cash at the same time that your Stock is granted to you. 
(iii) You must be employed by September 30 within the Performance Period in order to be eligible to participate in the Plan for the Performance Period. 
7.Effect of Termination of Employment.  Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary below  this Section 7, in the event of any inconsistency between this Section 7 and any written Individual Agreement you may have, the terms of such an Individual Agreement will control.  However, to the extent such an Individual Agreement provides for a payment of your annual bonus in cash, your Award will be settled in accordance with Section 6(b)(ii) above in the form of Stock.  In the event you do not have an Individual Agreement or your Individual Agreement does not address the treatment of Annual Incentive Awards under the Plan, and your employment is terminated at any time on or after the Award Date and before the Award is paid or settled, your Award will be treated as follows: 
(a) Death or Disability.  If your termination of employment is a result of your death or Disability, as determined by the Company in its sole and complete discretion, you will receive a pro-rata Award, if an Award is payable for the Performance Period,  based on the Base Salary you received during the Performance Period (the Pro-Rata Award); provided, however, that you must have been employed with the Company for a minimum of 90 days during the Performance Period in order to be eligible for a Pro-Rata Award described in this Section 7(a).  You, your beneficiaries, or your estate, as applicable, will receive the number of shares of  Stock  equal to your Pro-Rata Award (your Total Performance Score expressed as a percentage times your Target Award)  divided by the closing price of the Stock as of the trading day immediately preceding the date the Award is settled (adjusted for taxes pursuant to Section 10 hereof and rounded down to the next whole number).The resulting shares of Stock will be granted to you as soon as practicable after the Committee has certified the applicable Performance Goals were achieved for the Performance Period, but in no event later than the seventy-fifth (75th) day following the date the Performance Period ends. Any remaining value of the earned Award will be paid to you, your beneficiaries or your estate, as applicable, in cash at the same time that your Stock is granted pursuant to this Section 7(a). 
(b) Terminations other than Death or Disability.  Unless your termination of employment is a result of your death or Disability, you must be employed by the Company or a Subsidiary on the date Awards are paid in order to be eligible to receive settlement of an Award.  You have no vested interest in the Award prior to the Award actually being paid or settled to you by the Company.  If your employment with the Company or a Subsidiary terminates for any reason other than your death or Disability, whether your termination is voluntary or involuntary, with or without cause, you will not be eligible to receive payment or settlement of any Award for the Performance Period. 
8.Right of the Committee.  The Committee has the right to reduce or eliminate your Award for any reason regardless of the amount of your Total Performance Score achieved. 
9.Right of the Company and Subsidiaries to Terminate Services.  Nothing in this Agreement confers upon you the right to continue in the employ of the Company or any Subsidiary, or interfere in any way with the rights of the Company or any Subsidiary to terminate your employment at any time, with or without cause.

10.Withholding Taxes.  The Company may require you to pay to the Company (or the Companys Subsidiary if you are an employee of a Subsidiary of the Company), an amount the Company deems necessary to satisfy its (or its Subsidiarys) current or future obligation to withhold federal, state or local income or other taxes that you incur as a result of the Award.  With respect to any such required tax withholding, the Company shall withhold from the Stock (and to the extent necessary, the cash payment) to be issued to you under this Agreement the amount necessary to satisfy the Companys obligation to withhold taxes.  To the extent that the Company withholds shares of Stock, the determination of how many shares to withhold will be based on the Stocks Fair Market Value at the time such determination is made.   
11.Furnish Information.  You agree to furnish to the Company all information requested by the Company to enable it to comply with any reporting or other requirements imposed upon the Company by or under any applicable statute or regulation. 
12.No Liability for Good Faith Determinations.  The Company, the Committee and the members of the Board shall not be liable for any act, omission or determination taken or made in good faith with respect to this Agreement or the Award granted hereunder. 
13.Execution of Receipts and Releases.  Any payment of stock or cash to you, or to your legal representative, heir, legatee or distributee, in accordance with the provisions hereof, shall, to the extent thereof, be in full satisfaction of all claims of such Persons hereunder. The Company may require you or your legal representative, heir, legatee or distributee, as a condition precedent to such payment, to execute a release and receipt therefor in such form as the Company shall determine. 
14.Notice.  All notices required or permitted under this Agreement must be in writing and personally delivered or sent by mail and shall be deemed to be delivered on the date on which it is actually received by the person to whom it is properly addressed or if earlier the date it is sent via certified United States mail. 
15.Waiver of Notice.  Any person entitled to notice hereunder may waive such notice in writing. 
16.Information Confidential.  As partial consideration for the granting of the Award hereunder, you hereby agree to keep confidential all information and knowledge, except that which has been disclosed in any public filings required by law, that you have relating to the terms and conditions of this Agreement; provided, however, that such information may be disclosed as required by law and may be given in confidence to your spouse and tax and financial advisors.  In the event any breach of this promise comes to the attention of the Company, it shall take into consideration that breach in determining whether to recommend the grant of any future similar award to you, as a factor weighing against the advisability of granting any such future award to you. 
17.Nontransferability.  Neither this Agreement nor this Award subject to this Agreement shall be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, exchange, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or garnishment by your creditors or your beneficiary, except transfer by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. All rights with respect to this Agreement shall be exercisable during your lifetime only by yourself or, if necessary, your guardian or legal representative. 
18.Successors. This Agreement shall be binding upon you, your legal representatives, heirs, legatees and distributees, and upon the Company, its successors and assigns. 
19.Severability.  If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining provisions hereof, but such provision shall be fully

Executive:   Krohn 
 
 
severable and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had never been included herein. 
20.Amendment.  The Committee may amend this Agreement at any time; provided, however, that no such amendment may adversely affect your rights under this Agreement without your consent, except to the extent such amendment is reasonably determined by the Committee, in its sole discretion, to be necessary to comply with applicable law or to prevent a detrimental accounting impact. No amendment or addition to this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing. 
21.Headings.  The titles and headings of Sections are included for convenience of reference only and are not to be considered in construction of the provisions hereof. 
22.Governing Law.  All questions arising with respect to the provisions of this Agreement shall be determined by application of the laws of Texas, without giving any effect to any conflict of law provisions thereof, except to the extent Texas state law is preempted by federal law.   
23.Consent to Texas Jurisdiction and Venue.  You hereby consent and agree that state courts located in Harris County, Texas and the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas each shall have personal jurisdiction and proper venue with respect to any dispute between you and the Company arising in connection with the Award or this Agreement.  In any dispute with the Company, you will not raise, and you hereby expressly waive, any objection or defense to any such jurisdiction as an inconvenient forum. 
24. The Plan.  This Agreement is subject to all the terms, conditions, limitations and restrictions contained in the Plan. 
25.Acceptance.  This Agreement shall be deemed accepted by you unless you notify the Manager of Human Resources of the Company on or before June 20, 2013 that you reject the Award under this Agreement, in which event the Award shall be deemed forfeited and this Agreement shall have no further force or effect.
