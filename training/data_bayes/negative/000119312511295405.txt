(i) Payout multiples between the numbers 40 and 200 on the chart in Section 6(a) above will be calculated using
straight-line interpolation.  (ii) Any Award that is earned will be paid in cash as soon as
practicable after the Committee has certified the applicable Performance Goals were achieved for the Performance Period, but in no event later than the seventy-fifth (75th) day following the date the Performance Period ends. 
(iii) You must be employed or newly eligible by September 30 within the Performance Period in order to be eligible to

provisions to the contrary below in the remainder of this Section 7, in the event of any inconsistency between this Section 7 and any written Individual Agreement you may have, the terms of such an Individual Agreement will control In the
event you do not have an Individual Agreement or your Individual Agreement does not address the treatment of Annual Incentive Awards under the Plan, if your employment is terminated at any time on or after the Award Date and before the Award is
paid, your Award will be treated as follows:  (a) Death or Disability. If your termination
of employment is a result of your death or Disability, as determined by the Company in its sole and complete discretion, you will receive a pro-rata Award, if an Award is payable for the Performance Period, calculated based on the number of days
during the Performance Period that you were employed with the Company divided by the number of days in the Performance Period (the Pro-Rata Award). You, your beneficiaries, or your estate, as applicable, will be paid in
cash as soon as practicable after the date of your termination of employment following the Committees review, analysis and certification of all applicable items necessary to calculate your pro-rata Award, but in no event later than the
seventy-fifth (75th) day following the date of your
termination of employment; provided, however, that you must have been employed with the Company for a minimum of 90 days during the Performance Period in order to be eligible for a Pro-Rata Award described in this Section 7(a).
 (b) Terminations other than Death or Disability. Unless your termination of employment is a result of your
death or Disability, you must be employed by the Company or a Subsidiary on the date Awards are paid in order to be eligible to receive payment of an Award. You have no vested interest to the Award prior to the Award actually being paid to you by
the 
   3 





 
Company. If your employment with the Company or a Subsidiary terminates for any reason other than your death or Disability, whether your termination is voluntary or involuntary, with or without
cause, you will not be eligible to receive payment of any Award for the Performance Period.  8. Right of the
Committee. The Committee has the right to reduce or eliminate your Award for any reason regardless of the amount of your Total Performance Score achieved.  9. Right of the Company and Subsidiaries to Terminate Services. Nothing in this Agreement confers upon you the right to continue in the employ of the Company or any Subsidiary, or interfere
in any way with the rights of the Company or any Subsidiary to terminate your employment at any time, with or without cause. 
10. Withholding Taxes. The Company may require you to pay to the Company (or the Companys Subsidiary if you are an
employee of a Subsidiary of the Company), an amount the Company deems necessary to satisfy its (or its Subsidiarys) current or future obligation to withhold federal, state or local income or other taxes that you incur as a result of the Award.
With respect to any such required tax withholding, the Company shall withhold from the payment to be issued to you under this Agreement the amount necessary to satisfy the Companys obligation to withhold taxes. 
11. Furnish Information. You agree to furnish to the Company all information requested by the Company to enable it to
comply with any reporting or other requirements imposed upon the Company by or under any applicable statute or regulation.

for any act, omission or determination taken or made in good faith with respect to this Agreement or the Award granted hereunder.  13. Execution of Receipts and Releases. Any payment of cash to you, or to your legal representative, heir, legatee or distributee, in accordance with the provisions hereof, shall, to the
extent thereof, be in full satisfaction of all claims of such Persons hereunder. The Company may require you or your legal representative, heir, legatee or distributee, as a condition precedent to such payment, to execute a release and receipt
therefor in such form as the Company shall determine.  14. Notice. All notices required or permitted under this
Agreement must be in writing and personally delivered or sent by mail and shall be deemed to be delivered on the date on which it is actually received by the person to whom it is properly addressed or if earlier the date it is sent via certified
United States mail.  15. Waiver of Notice. Any person entitled to notice hereunder may waive such notice in
writing.  16. Information Confidential. As partial consideration for the granting of the Award hereunder, you
hereby agree to keep confidential all information and knowledge, except that which has been disclosed in any public filings required by law, that you have relating to the terms and conditions of this Agreement; provided, however, that
such information may be 
   4 





 
disclosed as required by law and may be given in confidence to your spouse and tax and financial advisors. In the event any breach of this promise comes to the attention of the Company, it shall
take into consideration that breach in determining whether to recommend the grant of any future similar award to you, as a factor weighing against the advisability of granting any such future award to you. 
17. Nontransferability. Neither this Agreement nor this Award subject to this Agreement shall be subject in any manner to
anticipation, alienation, sale, exchange, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or garnishment by your creditors or your beneficiary, except transfer by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. All rights with respect to the Agreement
shall be exercisable during your lifetime only by yourself or, if necessary, your guardian or legal representative.  18.
Successors. This Agreement shall be binding upon you, your legal representatives, heirs, legatees and distributees, and upon the Company, its successors and assigns. 
19. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or
invalidity shall not affect the remaining provisions hereof, but such provision shall be fully severable and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had never been included herein. 
20. Amendment. The Committee may amend this Agreement at any time; provided, however, that no such amendment
may adversely affect your rights under this Agreement without your consent, except to the extent such amendment is reasonably determined by the Committee, in its sole discretion, to be necessary to comply with applicable law or to prevent a
detrimental accounting impact. No amendment or addition to this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing.  21.
Headings. The titles and headings of Sections are included for convenience of reference only and are not to be considered in construction of the provisions hereof.  22. Governing Law. All questions arising with respect to the provisions of this Agreement shall be determined by application of the laws of Texas, without giving any effect to any conflict
of law provisions thereof, except to the extent Texas state law is preempted by federal law.  23. Consent to Texas
Jurisdiction and Venue. You hereby consent and agree that state courts located in Harris County, Texas and the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas each shall have personal jurisdiction and proper venue with respect to
any dispute between you and the Company arising in connection with the Award or this Agreement. In any dispute with the Company, you will not raise, and you hereby expressly waive, any objection or defense to any such jurisdiction as an inconvenient
forum.  24. The Plan. This Agreement is subject to all the terms, conditions, limitations and restrictions
contained in the Plan.  [Signature Page to Follow]
