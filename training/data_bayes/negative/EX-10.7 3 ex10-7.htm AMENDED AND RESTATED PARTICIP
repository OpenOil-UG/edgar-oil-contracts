ARTICLE II
 
ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION
 
 
(Note: In this Article II, Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in Exhibit “E.”)
 
    
2.1
As additional consideration for its participation in the prospects developed by Ridgelake on the Leases, GulfX has procured the issuance to Ridgelake and/or its designee(s) of Two Million Five Hundred Thousand (2,500,000) Discovery Shares (the “GulfX Discovery Shares”) in GulfX Limited, an Australia company (“GulfX Limited”), the terms of which are specified in Exhibit “E-1” attached hereto.
 
Likewise, as additional consideration for its participation in the prospects developed by Ridgelake on the Leases, South Marsh has procured the issuance to Ridgelake and/or its designee(s) of (i) One Million (1,000,000) Discovery Shares (the “Entek Discovery Shares”) in Entek Energy Ltd. (“Entek”), the terms of which are specified in Exhibit “E-2” attached hereto; and (ii) Three Hundred Thousand (300,000) options (the “Options”) in Entek or any successor by name change, merger or other corporate action, the terms of which are specified in Exhibit “E-3” attached hereto.
 
The GulfX Discovery Shares and Entek Discovery Shares are collectively referred to herein as the “Discovery Shares.”
 
The Discovery Shares and Options are subject to whatever restrictions that may be placed upon them under the rules and regulations of the Australian Stock Exchange Ltd. (“ASX”). Each Participant shall use its best efforts to ensure that the issuer of the Discovery Shares or Options, as applicable, procured by it shall not impose or cause to be imposed restrictions on the conversion of such Discovery Shares or the resale of the Shares in addition to those set forth (i) in this Agreement and the respective Exhibit “E-1,” “E-2,” or “E-3,” as applicable or (ii) by operation of law under the rules and regulations of the ASX.
 
    
2.2
Each Discovery Share and each Option shall be convertible into one Share as set forth in the respective Exhibit “E-1,” “E-2,” or “E-3,” as applicable. If, following the date of this Agreement, an issuer of Discovery Shares or Options elects to undertake a consolidation of share capital, then any Discovery Shares or Options issued to Ridgelake or its designee(s) shall be subject to consolidation at the same ratio; provided, however, that Ridgelake shall not suffer, as the result of any such consolidation, a dilution in the value of the Discovery Shares, in the value of the Options, or in the value of Shares to be issued upon conversion of the Options or Discovery Shares, as applicable.
 
    
2.3
Each Participant represents and warrants that at an Extraordinary General Meeting (“EGM”) of the issuer of the Discovery Shares or Options procured by such Participant, such issuer’s shareholders approved corporate resolutions necessary to, among others, (i) change the nature of the issuer’s business direction to that of an oil and gas company, (ii) as to issuers of Discovery Shares, amend the issuer’s constitution to create the class of shares entitled “Discovery Shares” with terms and conditions as set forth herein and in Exhibit E-1 or E-2, as applicable, (iii) authorize the issuer’s Board of Directors to issue Options and/or Discovery Shares to Ridgelake (300,000 Options, 2,500,000 Discovery Shares in the case of the GulfX Discovery Shares, and 1,000,000 Discovery Shares in the case of the Entek Discovery Shares) and, (iv) authorize its Board of Directors to authorize Shares necessary to accommodate conversion of the Options and/or Discovery Shares, as applicable, and (v) authorize a consolidation of capital of the issuer.
 

 
    
2.4
Authorization and Issuance. Each Participant shall use its best efforts to ensure that upon issuance, the Options, Discovery Shares and the Shares procured by such Participant will have been duly authorized by the Board of Directors and shareholders of the issuer thereof and, when issued in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, will be fully paid, non-assessable and validly issued.
 
    
2.5
Authority of Participants. Each Participant represents that it has full power, authority and legal capacity to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement, and that all corporate action necessary for such Participant’s execution of this Agreement and its consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will have been duly and effectively taken upon execution.
 
    
2.6
Compliance with Applicable Laws; Permits. Each Participant shall use its best efforts to ensure that the issuer of the Options and/or Discovery Shares procured by it will comply in all material respects with the Australian Corporations Act and all applicable laws, rules and regulations enforced or promulgated by the ASX and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (collectively, the “Regulator”). To the knowledge of each Participant, the issuer of the Options and/or Discovery Shares procured by it has not received any written notice, nor does it have knowledge that any investigation or review by any governmental entity or Regulator with respect to the Shares or any of its assets is pending or threatened or that any such investigation or review is contemplated. To the knowledge of each Participant, none of the reports, documents or materials filed with or furnished to the Regulator or any governmental authority by the issuer of the Options and/or Discovery Shares procured by such Participant, with respect to the Discovery Shares, the Shares, or the business and operations of such issuer, contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits any statement of a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. Each Participant shall use its best efforts to ensure that the issuer of the Options and/or Discovery Shares procured by such Participant discloses, to the extent required by applicable law or the rules and regulations of the Regulator, the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of the issuance of the Options and/or the Discovery Shares, including the right to convert Options and/or Discovery Shares into Shares and the terms of such conversion.
 
    
2.7
Advice of Changes. Each Participant shall use its best efforts to ensure that the issuer of the Options and/or Discovery Shares procured by it shall as promptly as possible advise Ridgelake in writing of any change or event having a material adverse effect, or that such Participant or such issuer believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any representations, warranties or covenants of such Participant contained herein.
 

 
    
2.8
Agreement Valid and Binding. Each Participant represents and warrants that this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by such Participant and this Agreement is the legal, valid and binding obligation of such Participant, enforceable against such Participant in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights. Neither the execution and delivery by such Participant of this Agreement, nor the consummation by such Participant of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor the compliance by such Participant with or fulfillment by such Participant of the terms and provisions hereof will (i) with or without the giving of notice or lapse of time or both, conflict with or result in a breach or violation of, or default under, or permit the acceleration of any obligation under any provision of any agreement or other instrument or restriction of any kind to which such Participant is a party or by which such Participant is otherwise bound or affected, or (ii) violate any judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation applicable to such Participant, except in the case of the preceding clauses, for those conflicts, breaches, violations, defaults or accelerations that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have, or be reasonably likely to have, a material adverse effect on the ability of such Participant to perform its obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
 
    
2.9
Consents. Each Participant shall use its best efforts to ensure that the issuer of the Options and/or Discovery Shares procured by it provides all consents, approvals, waivers, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations or filings with, or notices to, the Regulator and any governmental entity, other regulator or other third party required for the issuance of the Options, the Discovery Shares and the Shares or the execution and delivery of this Agreement.
 
   2.10
No Misrepresentations. Each Participant represents and warrants that the warranties, representations and covenants made in this Agreement by such Participant do not contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated herein or necessary to make the statements herein, in the context in which they were made, not misleading.
 
ARTICLE III
 
INTEREST EARNED
 
   3.1
If a Participant participates in and pays its respective Cost Share (as set forth in the table in Section 1.1.1 above) of all Operations relevant to a particular Lease, delivers appropriate Options and/or Discovery Shares to Ridgelake and/or its designee(s) in accordance with Article II above and if such Participant has paid its respective Cost Share of all Sunk Costs and Lease Expenses relevant to the Leases, then such Participant shall earn an undivided working interest in the Lease upon which such Operations have been conducted equal to its respective “Earning Share,” as set forth in the table in Section 1.1.1 above.
 
   3.1.1        It is understood that any working interest earned by a Participant shall be subject to and shall bear its proportionate share (i.e., its respective Earning Share) of all burdens that attach to each Lease, including, but not limited to, lessor’s royalty and overriding royalties that are applicable to each Lease as of the effective date of this Agreement. (To the best of Ridgelake’s knowledge, each Lease is burdened with a 16 2/3% Royalty to Lessor and Overriding Royalties as follows: Viosca Knoll Block 79 – 4%; High Island Block A 307 – 4%; Vermilion Block 317 – 3 1/3%; South Marsh Island Block 138 – 3 1/3%; and South Marsh Island Block 152 – 3 1/3%.)
 
   3.2
Each Participant may earn its respective Earning Share in each Lease that is subject to this Agreement on a Lease-by-Lease basis. However, subject to and without waiver of the right to audit and dispute costs and expenses, should a Participant not timely pay all of its Cost Share of all costs and expenses of Operations on a Lease, then, if such Participant fails to pay such costs and expenses within ten (10) days after receiving a notice of default from Ridgelake, such Participant shall forfeit its right to earn a working interest in the particular Lease and will have no right to a refund of any money previously paid to Ridgelake relevant to the particular Lease.
 

 
 
ARTICLE IV
 
OPERATOR
 
    
4.1
Ridgelake shall be designated Operator for all wells drilled pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and shall conduct and direct all operations on the Leases, as permitted and required pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the JOA attached hereto as Exhibit “D”.
 
    
4.2
Notwithstanding the terms of the JOA, the timing and order of Operations shall be at Ridgelake’s sole discretion, until such time as a Participant has earned a working interest in a particular Lease. Once a Participant has earned a working interest in a Lease, then, insofar and only insofar as said Lease is concerned, the terms of the JOA shall be applicable to a proposal by such Participant relevant to the drilling of wells or other operations on the Lease.
 
   4.2.1
It is the intention of the Parties that a well shall be spudded on each Lease prior to the first day of the beginning of the last year of the primary term of each Lease. However, it is understood and agreed that for various reasons a well may not be spudded on each Lease as anticipated. If a well is not so spudded on a particular Lease before the first day of the beginning of the last year of the primary term for a particular Lease, then it is understood and agreed that a Participant in such Lease may submit a proposal to Ridgelake for the drilling of a well on the particular Lease in accordance with the terms of the JOA attached hereto. If Ridgelake agrees to participate in the well proposed by such Participant, then the well shall be drilled in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Participants must complete the interest earning operations in order to earn an interest in the Lease. However, if Ridgelake does not agree to proceed with the well, then a Participant in the Lease may proceed to drill the well under the terms of the JOA attached hereto and, if the said well is completed by the Participant, then the Participants in such well shall earn their respective working interests in the Lease (as set forth in Section 3.1 above) and any penalties under the JOA shall be applicable to Ridgelake’s interest in the well. (It is recognized that other parties may be participating in a particular Lease under agreements that are similar to this Agreement. Accordingly, any penalty applicable to Ridgelake’s interest will be proportionately allocated to those parties who have agreed to participate in the well.)
 
   4.2.2
If no well is spudded on a particular Lease before expiration of the Lease, this Agreement shall no longer be applicable to the Lease. However, it is understood and agreed that all money paid to Ridgelake under the terms of this Agreement shall be retained by Ridgelake and that there shall be no refund of any money to Participants.
 
    
4.3
Operator shall conduct all Operations in a good an workmanlike manner, but shall have no liability as Operator for losses sustained or liabilities incurred, except as may result from gross negligence or willful misconduct.
 
    
4.4
The number of employees used by Operator in conducting operations hereunder, their selection, the hours of labor, and the compensation for services performed, shall be determined by Operator, or its subcontractors, and all employees shall be the employees of Operator or its subcontractor.
 

 
 
ARTICLE V
 
EXPENDITURES AND LIABILITY OF PARTIES
 
    
5.1
The duties, obligations and liabilities of the Parties shall be several, not joint or collective. Each Party shall be solely responsible for its own obligations and for all expenses incurred by it in connection with this Agreement (including without limitation fees and expenses of its own counsel and consultants), and shall be liable only for its proportionate share of the costs of drilling and operating the well or wells pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. It is not the intention of the Parties to create, nor shall this Agreement be construed as creating, an association or trust, or to impose a partnership duty, obligation, or liability with regard to any one or more of the Parties hereto. However, notwithstanding any provisions herein that the rights and liabilities are several and not joint or collective, or that this Agreement and the Operations hereunder shall not constitute a partnership, each Party elects not to be excluded from the application of Subchapter K, Chapter 1, Subtitle A, Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and similar provisions of applicable state laws. The tax partnership shall be governed by Exhibit “F” attached to the JOA that is attached as Exhibit “D”.
 
    
5.2
All costs and expenses hereunder, and the accounting with respect thereto, shall be in accordance with the Accounting Procedure that is attached to the JOA; provided however, should any conflict exist between the provisions in the body of this Agreement and the said Accounting Procedure, the provisions in the body of this Agreement shall prevail.
 
   5.2.1
Ridgelake shall keep an accurate record of the joint account hereunder, showing expenses incurred and charges and credits made and returns made and received. Such records shall be available at all reasonable times for examination by a Participant or its authorized representatives, as provided in the JOA.
 
    
5.3
Ridgelake shall pay or cause to be paid all rentals, and minimum royalty payments which may be required under the terms of the Leases; provided, however, it is understood and agreed that Ridgelake shall have no liability to Participants for losses sustained or liabilities incurred for failure to so properly pay rents and/or minimum royalties or to otherwise maintain such Leases.
 
ARTICLE VI
 
MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS
 
    
6.1
This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors and assigns of the Parties; provided, however, it is understood and agreed that no Participant may sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of its rights hereunder except as expressly provided in this Agreement.
 
    
6.2
The delay or failure on the part of any Party hereto to insist, in any one instance or more, upon the strict performance of any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement, or to exercise any right or privilege herein conferred shall not be construed as a waiver of any such terms, conditions, rights or privileges but the same shall continue and remain in full force and effect. In addition, no waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provision hereof (whether or not similar), nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided.
 
    
6.3
SHOULD A PARTICIPANT EARN A WORKING INTEREST IN ANY LEASE PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE INTEREST EARNED BY PARTICIPANT IN SUCH LEASE SHALL BE ASSIGNED BY RIDGELAKE TO PARTICIPANT AS IS, AND RIDGELAKE MAKES NO WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, IN FACT OR BY LAW, WITH RESPECT TO TITLE, CONDITION, FITNESS FOR PURPOSE OR OTHERWISE, EXCEPT THAT RIDGELAKE SHALL WARRANT ITS TITLE TO THE LEASES AGAINST ANYONE ASSERTING AN ADVERSE CLAIM AGAINST THE INTEREST CONVEYED WHICH IS CREATED BY, THROUGH OR UNDER RIDGELAKE, BUT NOT OTHERWISE.
 
    
6.4
This Agreement and all instruments executed in accordance with it shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Louisiana, without regard to conflict of law rules that would direct application of the laws of another jurisdiction, except to the extent that it is mandatory that the laws of some other jurisdiction, where the Leases are located, shall apply.
 
    
6.5
This Agreement, including all exhibits and schedules attached hereto and made a part hereof constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as between GulfX and South Marsh, this Agreement specifically supersedes and replaces the South Marsh Participation Agreement, which, effective as of the date hereof, shall be of no further force or effect. No supplement, amendment, alteration, modification, waiver or termination of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by the Parties hereto.
 
    
6.6
Any notice provided or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be in writing, and may be served by personal delivery, facsimile transmission, or be depositing same in the mail, addressed to the Party to be notified, postage paid. Notices served in any manner shall be deemed to have been given and received only if and when actually received by the addressee (except that notice given by telecopier shall be deemed given and received, other than during normal business hours, as of the opening of business on the next business day). For purposes of notice, the addresses of the parties shall be as follows:

4.2           Resignation or Removal of Operator.  Operator may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to Non-Operators.  In addition, Operator may be removed by the affirmative vote of the Parties owning a combined Working Interest of fifty-one percent (51%) or more after excluding Operator’s Working Interest if:
 
 
(a)
Operator becomes insolvent or unable to pay its debts as they mature, makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, commits an act of bankruptcy, or seeks relief under laws providing for the relief of debtors; or
 
(b)
a receiver is appointed for Operator or for substantially all of its property or affairs.
 
(c)
Operator sells, trades, transfers or assigns all or a portion of its Working Interest, thereby reducing its Working Interest to less than ten percent (10%); or
 
(d)
Operator commits a substantial breach of a material provision of this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within sixty (60) days after receipt of a Non-operator’s notice to Operator of such breach.
 
The resignation or removal of the Operator shall become effective as soon as practical, but not later than 7:00 o'clock a.m. on the first day of the calendar month following a period of ninety (90) days after i) the date of notice of resignation by Operator or ii) the date of receipt of written notice by Operator from Non-Operator detailing the alleged grounds for removal and Operator has failed to cure same within sixty (60) days from its receipt of the notice, unless a longer period is required for the Parties to obtain approval of the designation of the successor Operator by the MMS; however, in no event shall the resignation or removal of Operator become effective until a successor Operator has assumed the duties of Operator.  Upon approval of the designation of the successor Operator by the MMS, the resigning or removed Operator shall be bound by the terms of this Joint Operating Agreement as a Non-Operator.  A change of a corporate name or structure of Operator or transfer of Operator’s interest to any single subsidiary, parent or successor corporation shall not be the basis for removal of Operator.

 
4
 

4.3           Selection of Successor.  Upon resignation or removal of Operator, a successor Operator shall be selected by an affirmative vote of the Parties having a combined majority Working Interest.  However, if the removed or resigned Operator fails to vote or votes only to succeed itself, the successor Operator shall be selected by an affirmative vote of the Parties having a combined Working Interest of fifty-one percent (51%) or more of the remaining Working Interest left after excluding the Working Interest of the removed or resigned Operator.  In no event shall the resignation or removal of Operator become finally effective unless and until a successor Operator has been elected and assumed its duties.
 
4.4           Delivery of Property.  Prior to the effective date of resignation or removal, the former Operator shall deliver to the successor Operator all records and data relating to the operations conducted by the former Operator that the successor Operator is entitled to have and that are not already in the possession of the successor Operator, as well as all other property in the possession of the former Operator that was acquired for the Joint Account.
 
4.5           Liability of Operator.  If Operator resigns, or if Operator is removed as Operator, such resignation, or removal shall not relieve Operator of any liabilities it may have to Non-Operator(s) or third parties for damages arising out of Operator's breach of this Agreement.
 
4.6           Removal and Selection of a Successor Operator in a Two-party Agreement.  If this Agreement involves only two parties, the following provisions shall apply:
 
 
4.6.1  On the occurrence of an event specified in Section 4.2 that allows removal of Operator, Non-Operator shall have the option of either becoming Operator or allowing Operator to continue in that position.
 
 
4.6.2  If Operator resigns, Non-Operator, at its option, shall have the option of either becoming Operator or terminating this Agreement.
 
4.7           Designation of Operator.  The Parties hereto agree to execute such Designation of Operator forms as are required to have the Operator or its successor properly designated as operator with the Minerals Management Service or any other governmental authority having jurisdiction over the Lease and the operations conducted thereunder.



ARTICLE 5
AUTHORITY AND DUTIES OF OPERATOR

5.1           Exclusive Right to Operate.  Unless otherwise provided, Operator shall have the exclusive right to conduct all operations pursuant to this Agreement.  In performing services under this Agreement for the Non-Operator, Operator shall be an independent contractor, not subject to the control or direction of Non-Operator, except for the type of operation to be undertaken in accordance with the voting and election procedures contained within this Agreement.  Operator shall not be deemed to be, or hold itself out as, the agent or fiduciary of Non-Operator.
 
5
5.2           Workmanlike Conduct.  Operator shall conduct all operations in a good and workmanlike manner as would a prudent operator under the same or similar circumstances.  Operator shall not be liable to Non-Operator for losses sustained or liabilities incurred, except such as may result from Operator’s gross negligence or willful misconduct.  Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, Operator shall consult with Non-Operator and keep them informed of all important matters.  However, Operator shall never be required under this Agreement to conduct an operation that it believes would be unsafe or would endanger persons or property.
 
5.3           Liens and Encumbrances.  Operator shall endeavor to keep the Lease within the Contract Area and equipment free from all liens and encumbrances occasioned by operations hereunder, except those provided for in Section 8.5 (Security Rights).
 
5.4           Employees.  The number of employees and their selection, and the hours of labor and compensation for services performed shall be determined by Operator.  Except as provided in Exhibit “C”, such employees shall be the employees of Operator.
 
5.5           Records.  Operator shall keep accurate books, accounts, and records of operations under this Agreement, which, unless otherwise provided for in this Agreement, shall be available to Non-Operator as provided in Exhibit "C".
 
5.6           Compliance.  Operator shall comply with, and require all agents and contractors to comply with, all applicable laws, rules, regulations and orders of any governmental authorities having jurisdiction.

Insofar as possible, Operator shall use competitive bidding to procure goods and services for the benefit of the Parties.  All drilling operations conducted under this Agreement shall be conducted by qualified and responsible drilling contractors under current competitive contracts.  A drilling contract will be deemed to be a current competitive contract if it (a) was made within one hundred (180) days before the commencement of the well and (b) contains terms, rates, and provisions that, when the contract was made, did not exceed those generally prevailing in the area for operations involving substantially equivalent rigs that are capable of drilling the proposed well.  At its election, Operator may use its own or an Affiliate’s drilling equipment, derrick barge, tools, or machinery to conduct drilling operations, but the work shall be (a) performed by Operator acting as an independent contractor, (b) approved by written agreement with the Participating Parties before commencement of operations, and (c) conducted under the same terms and conditions and at the same rates as are customary and prevailing in competitive contracts  of third parties doing work of a similar nature.  Before awarding a drilling contract or performing work with its own or an Affiliate’s drilling equipment, derrick barge, tools, or machinery, Operator shall attempt to obtain competitive bids for the work from independent contractors.

 
6
 

5.8           Governmental Reports.  Operator shall make reports to governmental authorities that it has a duty to make as Operator and shall furnish copies of such reports to the Participating Parties.

(a)
A copy of application for permit to drill and all amendments thereto.
 
(b)
Daily drilling reports.
 
(c)
A complete report of all core analyses, if any.
 
(d)
A copy of any logs or surveys as run.
 
(e)
A copy of any well test results, bottom-hole pressure surveys, gas and condensate analyses, or similar information.
 
(f)
A copy of reports made to regulatory agencies.
 
(g)
To the extent possible, twenty-four (24) hour advance notice by telephone to the designated representative listed in Exhibit "A" (or the designated alternate), of logging, coring and testing operations.
 
(h)
If available, upon written request, samples of cuttings and cores marked as to depth, to be packaged and shipped at the expense of the requesting Party.
 
5.10           Information to Non-Participating Parties.  Operator shall furnish to each Non-Participating Party a copy of Operator’s governmental reports that are available to the public and associated with the applicable Non-consent operation.  A Non-Participating Party shall be entitled to receive the information specified in Section 5.9 after the recoupment provisions in Section 10.4 and/or Section 12.2.1 have been satisfied.

ARTICLE 6.
VOTING AND VOTING PROCEDURES

6.1           Designation of Representatives.  The names and addresses of the representative and alternate, who are authorized to represent each Party with respect to operations hereunder, are set forth in Exhibit "A".  The designated representative or alternate may be changed by written notice to the other Parties.


6.2              Voting Procedures.  Unless otherwise provided, any matter requiring approval of the Parties, except an amendment to this Agreement, shall be determined as follows:
 
 
6.2.1
Voting Interest.  Subject to section 8.6, each Party shall have a voting interest equal to its Working Interest or its Participating Interest, as applicable.
 
 
6.2.2
Vote Required.  Proposals requiring approval of the Parties shall be decided by an affirmative vote of two (2) or more Parties having a combined voting interest of fifty-one percent (51%) or more.  If there are only two (2) Parties to this Agreement, the matter shall be determined by the Party having the majority voting interest, or, if the interests are equal, the matter shall require unanimous consent.
 
 
 
 
7
 
 
6.2.3
Votes.  The Parties may vote personally at meetings, or by telephone, promptly confirmed in writing to Operator, or by letter, telegram, telex, telecopy, or other form of facsimile transmission.

Except in the case of emergency, or except when agreed by unanimous consent, no meeting shall be called on less than seven (7) days advance written notice.  Notice of such meeting shall include the agenda of matters to be considered.  The representative of Operator shall be chairman of each meeting.  Only matters provided for in the agenda of the meeting shall be decided and acted upon at a meeting; provided, however, that by unanimous agreement of the Parties present at such meeting, the agenda and items included therein may be amended.

ARTICLE 7
 
ACCESS

7.1           Access to Contract Area.  Each Non-Operator shall have access to the Contract Area at its sole cost, risk and expense at all reasonable times to inspect joint operations, wells, Platforms, Facilities or Subsequent Facilities in which it participates, and records and data pertaining thereto.  Non-Operator shall give Operator at least twenty-four (24) hours’ notice of Non-Operator’s intention to visit the Lease.  To protect Operator and Non-Operator from unnecessary lawsuits, claims, and legal liability, if it is necessary for a person who is not performing services for Operator directly related to a joint operation, but is performing services solely for a Non-Operator or pertaining to the business or operations of a Non-Operator, to visit, use, or board a rig, Platform, or Facility on a Lease subject to this agreement, the Non-Operator shall give Operator advance notice of the visit, use or boarding, and shall secure from that person an agreement, in a form satisfactory to Operator, indemnifying and holding Operator and Non-Operator harmless, or shall itself provide the same hold harmless and indemnification in favor of Operator and the other Non-Operators before the visit, use, or boarding.


7.2           Reports.  Upon written request, Operator shall furnish a requesting Party any information not otherwise furnished under Article 5 to which such Party is otherwise entitled under this Agreement.  The cost of gathering and furnishing information not furnished under Article 5 shall be charged to the requesting Party.  Operator is not obligated to furnish interpretative data that was generated by Operator at its sole cost.
 
8
7.3           Confidentiality.  For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "Confidential Information" shall mean any geological, geophysical, engineering, technical, production test, exploratory, or reservoir information, or any logs or other information pertaining to any well drilled pursuant to this Agreement or any operation conducted under the terms of this Agreement to the extent that such information was acquired at joint expense.  Except as provided in Section 7.5 and except for necessary disclosures to governmental authorities having jurisdiction, no Party shall during the term of this Agreement and for a period of three (3) years thereafter, trade, sell, publish or release any such Confidential Information without the agreement of all Participating Parties.  Otherwise, the Parties shall jointly own all such Confidential Information without duty to account.  Each Party's obligation to protect Confidential Information shall be considered met by each Party using at least the same degree of care as it uses in protecting its own proprietary materials of like kind.
 
7.4           Exceptions.  No Party shall have any obligation to limit disclosure or use any portion of Confidential Information which:
 
 
(a)
is already in that Party's possession prior to receipt as a result of this Agreement;
 
(b)
is now in or hereafter becomes publicly available through no fault of that Party;
 
(c)
is disclosed to that Party without obligation of confidence by a third party which has the right to make such disclosure; or;
 
(d)
is independently developed by or for such Party without reference to information received under this Agreement.
 
7.5           Limited Disclosure.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Parties may make Confidential Information available to third parties as follows:
 
 
(a)
outside professional consultants  and reputable engineering firms for the purpose of evaluations;
 
(b)
gas transmission companies for hydrocarbon reserve or technical evaluations;
 
(c)

EXPENDITURES

8.1           Basis of Charge to the Parties.  Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Operator shall pay all costs incurred and each Party shall reimburse Operator in proportion to its Participating Interest.  All charges, credits and accounting for expenditures shall be pursuant to Exhibit "C".
 
8.2           Authorization.  Prior to undertaking any project or making any single expenditure related to the Contract Area in excess of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00), Operator shall submit for the approval of the Parties an Authorization for Expenditure ("AFE") for such project or expenditure.  Operator shall furnish written information to all the Parties on any project or single expenditure costing less than One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00) but in excess of Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00) if Operator prepares same for its own use.  Notwithstanding the One Hundred Thousand Dollar ($100,000.00) limitation, where such project or expenditure involves changing zones in a well or a workover operation, an AFE shall be submitted to the Parties for approval.  Approval of a Development Well or an Exploratory Well operation shall include approval of all necessary expenditures through drilling, coring and logging to the objective depth and plugging and abandoning costs, if applicable.  In the event of an actual or imminently threatened blowout, explosion, accident, fire, flood, storm, or other emergency, Operator may immediately conduct such operations and make such expenditures as in its opinion are required to overcome the emergency, including, but not limited to, any and all measures to protect life, health, safety, property, natural resources or the environment.  Operator shall report to the Parties, as promptly as possible, the nature of the emergency and action taken.  The Operator shall provide supplemental AFE’s to Participating Parties, for informational purposes only, if it reasonably determines that the expected actual costs of an operation will exceed the amount of the approved AFE by 15% or more, but only if the dollar amount of such expected excess is greater than Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000.00).
 
10
8.3           Advance Billings.  Operator shall have the right to require each Party to advance its respective share of estimated expenditures pursuant to Exhibit "C".
 
8.4           Commingling of Funds.  Funds received by Operator under this Agreement may be commingled with its own funds.
 
8.5           Security Rights (Louisiana).  In addition to any other security rights and remedies provided by law with respect to services rendered or materials and equipment furnished under this Agreement, for and in consideration of the covenants and mutual undertakings of the Operator and the Non-operators herein, the Parties shall have the following security rights:
(a)           Mortgage in Favor of the Operator.  Each Non-operator hereby grants to the Operator a mortgage, hypothecate, and pledge of and over all of its rights, titles, and interests in and to (a) the Lease within the Contract Area, (b) the oil, gas and other minerals in, on, under, and that may be produced from the lands within the Contract Area, and (c) all other immovable property susceptible of mortgage situated within the Contract Area.
 
This mortgage is given to secure the complete and timely performance of and payment by each Non-operator of all obligations and indebtedness of every kind and nature, whether now owed by such Non-operator or hereafter arising, pursuant to this Agreement.  To the extent susceptible under applicable law, this mortgage and the security interests granted in favor of the Operator herein shall secure the payment of all costs and other expenses properly charged to such Party, together with (A) interest on such indebtedness, costs, and other expenses at the rate set forth in Exhibit "C" attached hereto (the "Accounting Procedure") or the maximum rate allowed by law, whichever is the lesser, (B) reasonable attorneys' fees, (C) court costs, and (D) other directly related collection costs.  If any Non-operator does not pay such costs and other expenses or perform its obligations under this Agreement when due, the Operator shall have the additional right to notify the purchaser or purchasers of the defaulting Non-operator's production of oil, gas and other minerals and collect such costs and other expenses out of the proceeds from the sale of the defaulting Non-operator's share of production of oil, gas and other minerals until the amount owed has been paid.  The Operator shall have the right to offset the amount owed against the proceeds from the sale of such defaulting Non-operator's share of production of oil, gas and other minerals.  Any purchaser of such production shall be entitled to rely on the Operator's statement concerning the amount of costs and other expenses owed by the defaulting Non-operator and payment made to the Operator by any purchaser shall be binding and conclusive as between such purchaser and such defaulting Non-operator.
 
The maximum amount for which the mortgage herein granted by each Non-operator shall be deemed to secure the obligations and indebtedness of such Non-operator to the Operator as stipulated herein is hereby fixed in an amount equal to $25,000,000.00 (the "Limit of the Mortgage of each Non-operator").  Except as provided in the previous sentence (and then only to the extent such limitations are required by law), the entire amount of obligations and indebtedness of each Non-operator to the Operator is secured hereby without limitation.  Notwithstanding the foregoing Limit of the Mortgage of each Non-operator, the liability of each Non-operator under this Agreement and the mortgage and security interest granted hereby shall be limited to (and the Operator shall not be entitled to enforce the same against such Non-operator for, an amount exceeding) the actual obligations and indebtedness [including all interest charges, costs, attorneys' fees, and other charges provided for in this Agreement or in the Memorandum of Operating Agreement and Financing Statement (Louisiana), as such term is defined in Article 8.5.(e) (Recordation) hereof] outstanding and unpaid and that are attributable to or charged against the interest of such Non-operator pursuant to this Agreement.

(b)           Security Interest in Favor of the Operator.  To secure the complete and timely performance of and payment by each Non-operator of all obligations and indebtedness of every kind and nature, whether now owed by such Non-operator or hereafter arising, pursuant to this Agreement, each Non-operator hereby grants to the Operator a continuing security interest in and to all of its rights, titles, interests, claims, general intangibles, proceeds, and products thereof, whether now existing or hereafter acquired, in and to (a) all oil, gas and other minerals produced from the lands or offshore blocks covered by the Leases within the Contract Area or attributable to the Leases within the Contract Area when produced, (b) all accounts receivable accruing or arising as a result of the sale of such oil, gas and other minerals (including, without limitation, accounts arising from gas imbalances or from the sale of oil, gas and other minerals at the wellhead), (c) all cash or other proceeds from the sale of such oil, gas and other minerals once produced, and (d) all Platforms and Facilities, wells, fixtures, other corporeal property, whether movable or immovable, whether now or hereafter placed on the lands or offshore blocks covered by the Leases within the Contract Area or maintained or used in connection with the ownership, use or exploitation of the Leases within the Contract Area, and other surface and sub-surface equipment of any kind or character located on or attributable to the Leases within the Contract Area and the cash or other proceeds realized from the sale, transfer, disposition or conversion thereof.  The interest of the Non-operators in and to the oil and gas produced from or attributable to the Leases within the Contract Area when extracted and the accounts receivable accruing or arising as the result of the sale thereof shall be financed at the wellhead of the well or wells located on the Leases within the Contract Area.  To the extent susceptible under applicable law, the security interest granted by each Non-operator hereunder covers: (A) all substitutions, replacements, and accessions to the property of such Non-operator described herein and is intended to cover all of the rights, titles and interests of such Non-operator in all movable property now or hereafter located upon or used in connection with the Leases within the Contract Area, whether corporeal or incorporeal; (B) all rights under any gas balancing agreement, farmout rights, option farmout rights, acreage and cash contributions, and conversion rights of such Non-operator in connection with the Leases within the Contract Area, or the oil, gas and other minerals produced from or attributable to the Leases within the Contract Area, whether now owned and existing or hereafter acquired or arising, including, without limitation, all interests of each Non-operator in any partnership, tax partnership, limited partnership, association, joint venture, or other entity or enterprise that holds, owns, or controls any interest in the Leases within the Contract Area; and (C) all rights, claims, general intangibles, and proceeds, whether now existing or hereafter acquired, of each Non-operator in and to the contracts, agreements, permits, licenses, rights-of-way, and similar rights and privileges that relate to or are appurtenant to the Leases within the Contract Area, including the following:

 
12
 

(1)           all of its rights, titles, and interests, whether now owned and existing or hereafter acquired or arising, in, to, and under or derived from any present or future operating, farmout, bidding, pooling, unitization, and communitization agreements, assignments, and subleases, whether or not described in Exhibit "A," to the extent, and only to the extent, that such agreements, assignments, and subleases cover or include any of its rights, titles, and interests, whether now owned and existing or hereafter acquired or arising, in and to all or any portion of the Leases within the Contract Area, and all units created by any such pooling, unitization, and communitization agreements and all units formed under orders, regulations, rules, or other official acts of any governmental authority having jurisdiction, to the extent and only to the extent that such units cover or include all or any portion of the Leases within the Contract Area;
 
(2)           all of its rights, titles, and interests, whether now owned and existing or hereafter acquired or arising, in, to, and under or derived from all presently existing and future advance payment agreements, and oil, casinghead gas, and gas sales, exchange, and processing contracts and agreements, including, without limitation, those contracts and agreements that are described on Exhibit "A," to the extent, and only to the extent, those contracts and agreements cover or include all or any portion of the Leases within the Contract Area; and
 
(3)           all of its rights, titles, and interests, whether now owned and existing or hereafter acquired or arising, in, to, and under or derived from all existing and future permits, licenses, rights-of-way, and similar rights and privileges that relate to or are appurtenant to the Leases within the Contract Area.
 
(c)           Mortgage in Favor of the Non-operators.  The Operator hereby grants to each Non-operator a mortgage, hypothecate, and pledge of and over all of its rights, titles, and interests in and to (a) the Lease within the Contract Area; (b) the oil, gas and other minerals in, on, under, and that my be produced from the lands within the Lease within the Contract Area; and (c) all other immovable property or other property susceptible of mortgage situated within the Lease within the Contract Area.
 
This mortgage is given to secure the complete and timely performance of and payment by the Operator of all obligations and indebtedness of every kind and nature, whether now owed by the Operator or hereafter arising, pursuant to this Agreement.  To the extent susceptible under applicable law, this mortgage and the security interests granted in favor of each Non-operator herein shall secure the payment of all costs and other expenses properly charged to the Operator, together with (A) interest on such indebtedness, costs, and other expenses at the rate set forth in Exhibit “C” or the maximum rate allowed by law, whichever is the lesser, (B) reasonable attorneys' fees, (C) court costs, and (D) other directly related collection costs.  If the Operator does not pay such costs and other expenses or perform its obligations under this Agreement when due, the Non-operators shall have the additional right to notify the purchaser or purchasers of the Operator’s production of oil, gas and other minerals and collect such costs and other expenses out of the proceeds from the sale of the Operator’s share of production of oil, gas and other minerals until the amount owed has been paid.  The Non-operators shall have the right to offset the amount owed against the proceeds from the sale of the Operator’s share of production of oil, gas and other minerals.  Any purchaser of such production shall be entitled to rely on the Non-operators’ statement concerning the amount of costs and other expenses owed by the Operator and payment made to the Non-operators by any purchaser shall be binding and conclusive as between such purchaser and the Operator.

 
13
 

The maximum amount for which the mortgage herein granted by the Operator shall be deemed to secure the obligations and indebtedness of the Operator to all Non-operators as stipulated herein is hereby fixed in an amount equal to $25,000,000.00 in the aggregate (the "Limit of the Mortgage of the Operator").  Except as provided in the previous sentence (and then only to the extent such limitations are required by law), the entire amount of obligations and indebtedness of the Operator to the Non-operators is secured hereby without limitation.  Notwithstanding the foregoing Limit of the Mortgage of the Operator, the liability of the Operator under this Agreement and the mortgage and security interest granted hereby shall be limited to (and the Non-operators shall not be entitled to enforce the same against the Operator for, an amount exceeding) the actual obligations and indebtedness [including all interest charges, costs, attorneys' fees, and other charges provided for in this Agreement or in the Memorandum of Operating Agreement and Financing Statement (Louisiana), as such term is defined in Article 8.5.(e) hereof] outstanding and unpaid and that are attributable to or charged against the interest of the Operator pursuant to this Agreement.
 
(d)           Security Interest in Favor of the Non-operators.  To secure the complete and timely performance of and payment by the Operator of all obligations and indebtedness of every kind and nature, whether now owed by the Operator or hereafter arising, pursuant to this Agreement, the Operator hereby grants to each Non-operator a continuing security interest in and to all of its rights, titles, interests, claims, general intangibles, proceeds, and products thereof, whether now existing or hereafter acquired, in and to (a) all oil, gas and other minerals produced from the lands or offshore blocks covered by the Leases within the Contract Area or included within the Leases within the Contract Area or attributable to the Leases within the Contract Area when produced, (b) all accounts receivable accruing or arising as a result of the sale of such oil, gas and other minerals (including, without limitation, accounts arising from gas imbalances or from the sale of oil, gas and other minerals at the wellhead), (c) all cash or other proceeds from the sale of such oil, gas and other minerals once produced, and (d) all Platforms and Facilities, wells, fixtures, other corporeal property whether movable or immovable, whether now or hereafter placed on the offshore blocks covered by the Leases within the Contract Area or maintained or used in connection with the ownership, use or exploitation of the Leases within the Contract Area, and other surface and sub-surface equipment of any kind or character located on or attributable to the Leases within the Contract Area and the cash or other proceeds realized from the sale, transfer, disposition or conversion thereof.  The interest of the Operator in and to the oil, gas and other minerals produced from or attributable to the Leases within the Contract Area when extracted and the accounts receivable accruing or arising as the result of the sale thereof shall be financed at the wellhead of the well or wells located on the Leases within the Contract Area. To the extent susceptible under applicable law, the security interest granted by the Operator hereunder covers: (A) all substitutions, replacements, and accessions to the property of the Operator described herein and is intended to cover all of the rights, titles and interests of the Operator in all movable property now or hereafter located upon or used in connection with the Leases within the Contract Area, whether corporeal or incorporeal; (B) all rights under any gas balancing agreement, farmout rights, option farmout rights, acreage and cash contributions, and conversion rights of the Operator in connection with the Leases within the Contract Area, the oil, gas and other minerals produced from or attributable to the Leases within the Contract Area, whether now owned and existing or hereafter acquired or arising, including, without limitation, all interests of the Operator in any partnership, tax partnership, limited partnership, association, joint venture, or other entity or enterprise that holds, owns, or controls any interest in the Leases within the Contract Area; and (C) all rights, claims, general intangibles, and proceeds, whether now existing or hereafter acquired, of the Operator in and to the contracts, agreements, permits, licenses, rights-of-way, and similar rights and privileges that relate to or are appurtenant to the Leases within the Contract Area, including the following:
 
 
14
 
(1)           all of its rights, titles, and interests, whether now owned and existing or hereafter acquired or arising, in, to, and under or derived from any present or future operating, farmout, bidding, pooling, unitization, and communitization agreements, assignments, and subleases, whether or not described in Exhibit "A," to the extent, and only to the extent, that such agreements, assignments, and subleases cover or include any of its rights, titles, and interests, whether now owned and existing or hereafter acquired or arising, in and to all or any portion of the Leases within the Contract Area, and all units created by any such pooling, unitization, and communitization agreements and all units formed under orders, regulations, rules, or other official acts of any governmental authority having jurisdiction, to the extent and only to the extent that such units cover or include all or any portion of the Leases within the Contract Area;
 
(2)           all of its rights, titles, and interests, whether now owned and existing or hereafter acquired or arising, in, to, and under or derived from all presently existing and future advance payment agreements, and oil, casinghead gas, and gas sales, exchange, and development contracts and agreements, including, without limitation, those contracts and agreements that are described on Exhibit "A," to the extent, and only to the extent, those contracts and agreements cover or include all or any portion of the Leases within the Contract Area; and
 
(3)           all of its rights, titles, and interests, whether now owned and existing or hereafter acquired or arising, in, to, and under or derived from all existing and future permits, licenses, rights-of-way, and similar rights and privileges that relate to or are appurtenant to any of the Leases within the Contract Area.
 
15
(e)           Recordation.  To provide evidence of, and to further perfect the Parties' security rights created hereunder, upon request, each Party shall execute and acknowledge the Memorandum of Operating Agreement and Financing Statement (Louisiana) attached as Exhibit "E" (the "Memorandum of Operating Agreement and Financing Statement (Louisiana)") in multiple counterparts as appropriate.  The Party requesting execution of the aforesaid document shall file the Memorandum of Operating Agreement and Financing Statement (Louisiana) in the public records set forth below at its sole cost and expense to serve as notice of the existence of this Agreement as a burden on the title of the Operator and the Non-operators to their interests in the Leases within the Contract Area and for purposes of satisfying otherwise relevant recording and filing requirements of applicable law and to attach an original of the Memorandum of Operating Agreement and Financing Statement (Louisiana) to a standard UCC-1 in mutually agreeable forms for filing in the UCC records set forth below to perfect the security interests created by the Parties in this Agreement.  Upon the acquisition of a leasehold interest in a Lease within the Contract Area, the Parties shall, within five business days following request by one of the Parties hereto, execute and furnish to the requesting Party for recordation such a Memorandum of Operating Agreement and Financing Statement (Louisiana) describing such leasehold interest.  Such Memorandum of Operating Agreement and Financing Statement (Louisiana) shall be amended from time to time upon acquisition of additional leasehold interests in the Leases within the Contract Area, and the Parties shall, within five business days following request by one of the Parties hereto, execute and furnish to the requesting Party for recordation any such amendment.
 
The Memorandum of Operating Agreement and Financing Statement (Louisiana) is to be filed or recorded, as the case may be, in (a) the conveyance records of the parish or parishes adjacent to the lands or offshore blocks covered by the Leases within the Contract Area or contained within the Leases within the Contract Area pursuant to La. R.S. 9:2731 et seq., (b) the mortgage records of such parish or parishes, and (c) the appropriate Uniform Commercial Code records.

 
16
 

 
 
8.6           Default.  If any Party does not pay its share of the charges authorized under this Agreement when due, the Operator may give the defaulting Party notice that unless payment is made within thirty (30) days from delivery of the notice, the non-paying Party shall be in default.  A Party in default shall have no further access to the rig, Platform or Facilities, any Confidential Information or other maps, records, data, interpretations, or other information obtained in connection with activities or operations hereunder or be allowed to participate in meetings.  A Party in default shall not be entitled to vote or to make an election until such time as the defaulting Party is no longer in default.  The voting interest of each non-defaulting Party shall be counted in the proportion its Participating Interest share bears to the total non-defaulting Participating Interest shares.  As to any operation approved during the time a Party is in default, such defaulting Party shall be deemed to be a Non-participating Party, except where such approval is binding on all Parties or Participating Parties, as applicable. In the event a Party believes that such statement of charges is incorrect, the Party shall nevertheless pay the amounts due as provided herein, and the Operator shall attempt to resolve the issue as soon as practicable, but said attempt shall be made no later than sixty (60) days after receiving notice from the Party of such disputed charges.
 
17
8.7           Unpaid Charges.  If any Participating Party fails to pay its share of the costs and other expenses authorized under this Agreement in accordance with Exhibit “C” or to otherwise perform any of its obligations under this Agreement when due, the Party to whom such payment is due, in order to take advantage of the provisions of Article 8.5, shall notify the other Party by certified or registered U.S. Mail that it is in default and has thirty (30) days from the receipt of such notice to pay.  If such payment is not made timely by the non-paying Party after the issuance of such notice to pay, the Party requesting such payment may take immediate steps to diligently pursue collection of the unpaid costs and other expenses owed by such Participating Party and to exercise the mortgage and security rights granted by this Agreement.  The bringing of a suit and the obtaining of a judgment by any Party for the secured indebtedness shall not be deemed an election of remedies or otherwise affect the security rights granted herein.  In addition to any other remedy afforded by law, each Party shall have, and is hereby given and vested with, the power and authority to foreclose the lien, mortgage, pledge, and security interest established hereby in its favor in the manner provided by law, to exercise all rights of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code as adopted by the state in which the Leases within the Contract Area are located or such other states as such Party may deem appropriate.  The Operator shall keep an accurate account of amounts owed by the nonperforming Party (plus interest and collection costs) and any amounts collected with respect to amounts owed by the nonperforming Party.  In the event there become three or more Parties to this Agreement, then if any nonperforming Party's share of costs remains delinquent for a period of sixty (60) days, each other Participating Party shall, upon the Operator's request, pay the unpaid amount of costs in the proportion that its Working Interest bears to the total non-defaulting Working Interests.  Each Participating Party paying its share of the unpaid amounts of a nonperforming Party shall be subrogated to the Operator's mortgage and security rights to the extent of the payment made by such Participating Party.
 
8.8           Carved-out Interests.  Except for the “Permitted Encumbrance” identified on Exhibit “A”, any agreements creating any overriding royalty, production payment, net proceeds interest, net profits interest, carried interest or any other interest carved out of a Working Interest in the Leases within the Contract Area shall specifically make such interests inferior to the rights of the Parties to this Agreement. If any Party whose Working Interest is so encumbered does not pay its share of costs and other expenses authorized under this Agreement, and the proceeds from the sale of its production of oil, gas and other minerals pursuant to Article 8.5 are insufficient to pay such costs and expenses, the security rights provided for in this Article 8.5 may be applied against the carved-out interests with which the defaulting or non-performing Party’s interest in the Leases within the Contract Area is burdened. In such event, the rights of the owner of such carved-out interest shall be subordinated to the security rights granted by Article 8.5.

ARTICLE 9
NOTICES

9.1           Giving and Responding to Notices.  All notices and responses thereto shall be in writing and delivered in person or by telephone followed by United States mail, telex, telegraph, telecopier (facsimile) or cable; however, if a drilling rig is on location and standby charges are accumulating, such notices and responses shall be given by telephone and immediately confirmed in writing.  Notices and responses shall be deemed given only when received by the Party to whom such notice or response is directed, except that any notice or response by certified United States mail or equivalent, telegraph, or cable properly addressed, pursuant to Section 6.1, and with all postage and charges prepaid shall be deemed given seventy-two (72) hours after such notice is deposited in the mail exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays, or twenty-four (24) hours after such notice or response is sent by telecopier (facsimile), receipt confirmed, or filed with an operating telegraph or cable company for immediate transmission exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays.
 
9.2           Content of Notice.  Any notice which requires a response shall indicate the response time specified in Section 9.3.  If a proposal involves a Platform, Facility or Subsequent Facility, the notice shall contain a description of same, including location and the estimated costs of design fabrication, transportation and installation.  If a proposal involves an Exploratory Operation or a Development Operation, the notice shall include the proposed depth, the objective zone or zones to be tested, the surface and bottom-hole locations, applicable details regarding directional drilling, the equipment to be used, and the estimated costs of the operation including all necessary expenditures through installation of the wellhead or abandonment of the well.
 
9.3           Response to Notices.  Each Party's response to a proposal shall be in writing to all other Parties.  Unless otherwise specified herein, response times shall be as follows:
 
9.3.1
Platform Construction.  When any proposal for well operations involves the construction of a Platform, each Party shall respond within sixty (60) days after receipt of notice.
 
 
 
19
 
9.3.2
Proposal Without Platform.  When any proposal for well operations does not require construction of a Platform, each Party shall respond within thirty (30) days after receipt of notice.  However, if a drilling rig is on location as a result of a joint Exploratory or Development Operation previously conducted thereon and standby charges are accumulating, the response shall be made within twenty-four (24) hours, inclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays, after receipt of notice.
 
9.3.3
Other Matters.  For all other matters requiring notice, each Party shall respond within thirty (30) days after receipt of notice.
 
9.4           Failure to Respond.  Failure of any Party to respond to a proposal or notice, to vote, or to elect to participate within the period required by this Agreement shall be deemed to be a negative response, vote, or election.
 
9.5           Restrictions on Multiple Well Proposals.  Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, it is specifically provided that no notice shall be given under this Article 9 hereof which simultaneously proposes the drilling of more than two (2) wells, or proposes the drilling of more than one (1) more well while there is an outstanding proposal.  Further, these provisions of this Article 9, insofar as they pertain to notification by a Party of its desire to drill a well, shall be suspended for so long as: (1) a prior notice has been given which is still in force and effect and the period of time during which the well regarding same may be commenced has not expired; or (2) a well is presently drilling hereunder.  This section shall not apply under those circumstances where the well to which notice is directed is a well which is required under the terms of a Lease or one required to maintain a portion thereof in force.  In the event drilling operations are necessary to perpetuate a Lease, any Party may propose and commence the drilling of such additional well(s) pursuant to the terms and conditions hereof no earlier than one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the date operations must be commenced, regardless of other proposals then under consideration or drilling operations then in progress.



ARTICLE 10
EXPLORATORY OPERATIONS

10.1           Operations by All Parties.  Any Party may propose an Exploratory Well by notifying the other Parties.  If all the Parties agree to participate in drilling the proposed well, Operator shall drill same at their cost and risk.  If a mobile drilling rig is not already on location as a result of a prior Exploratory or Development Operation and the proposal ("Original Proposal") has not already been approved, then any Party may submit an alternate well proposal for consideration within ten (10) days after receiving the Original Proposal to drill a well.  If one or more alternate proposals have been submitted in accordance with the foregoing, then the Operator shall call a meeting of the Parties to be held within seven (7) days following receipt of the alternate proposal(s), at which the Parties shall determine by majority vote in interest which proposal shall be considered by the Joint Account.  In the event that no proposal receives support of a majority in interest, then the proposal receiving the greatest support shall prevail.  In the event of a tie between two or more proposals, then the proposal (including the Original Proposal) supported by the largest number of Parties shall prevail.  Each Party having the right to participate in the proposal so selected shall make its election whether to join in the drilling of such well within fifteen (15) days after the meeting was held.  If drilling of such well is not commenced within one hundred twenty (120) days after the last applicable election date, the effect shall be the same as if the proposal had not been made; however, the one hundred twenty (120) day period shall automatically be extended for an additional period, not to exceed sixty (60) days, as may be necessary, in order to obtain all applicable required regulatory permits, so long as applications for such required permits were properly filed within thirty (30) days after the last applicable election date.  Drilling operations shall be deemed to have commenced on the date rig charges begin according to the terms of the drilling contract.
 
20
10.2           Second Opportunity to Participate.  If fewer than all but one (1) or more Parties having a combined Working Interest of twenty (20%) or more elect to participate, the Operator shall inform the Parties of the elections made, whereupon any Party originally electing not to participate may then elect to participate by notifying the Operator within forty-eight (48) hours, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays, after receipt of such information.  This provision shall apply only in the event that there are three (3) or more Parties to this Agreement.
 
10.3           Final Election to Participate.  If fewer than all but one (1) or more Parties having a combined Working Interest of twenty (20%) or more approve any proposed  operation, the Operator, immediately after the expiration of the applicable response time, shall inform the Parties who have elected to participate of the total interest of the Parties approving such operation.  Each Participating Party, within forty-eight (48) hours (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays) after receipt of such notice, shall advise the Operator of its desire to (a) limit participation to such Party's working interest as shown on the proposed AFE; or (b) carry its proportionate part of Non-Participating Parties’ interests.  Failure to advise the proposing Party shall be deemed an election under (a), notwithstanding Section 9.4.  Should any Party elect to limit its participation to its interest as shown on the proposed AFE, the remaining Participating Parties shall carry the Non-Participating Parties' interests in such proportions as the remaining Participating Parties agree to by mutual consent.  In the event a drilling rig is on location, the time permitted for any response under this Article 10 shall not exceed a total of twenty-four (24) hours, inclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays.  This provision shall apply only in the event that there are three (3) or more Parties to this Agreement.


10.4           Operations by Fewer Than All Parties.  If fewer than all but one (1) or more Parties having a combined Working Interest of twenty percent (20%) or more elect to participate in and agree to bear all of the cost and risk of drilling the proposed well, Operator shall drill such well under this Agreement and the applicable provisions of Article 12 and the following special provisions shall apply:
 
 
(a)
If the well will be the first Exploratory Well drilled under this Agreement, then as of the last applicable election date, each Non-Participating Party shall be deemed to have relinquished to the Participating Parties, in proportion to their Participating Interests or in the proportions otherwise agreed by the Participating Parties, all of its interest in the Contract Area.  If such well is commenced within the time provided in Section 10.1 and is drilled as proposed in accordance with this Agreement, each Non-Participating Party shall execute an assignment of all of its interest in the Contract Area to the Participating Parties, in proportion to their Participating Interests or in the proportions otherwise agreed by the Participating Parties.
 
(b)
If the well will not be the first Exploratory Well drilled under this Agreement and if such well is commenced within the time provided in Section 10.1 and is drilled as proposed in accordance with this Agreement, then, all of the Non-Participating Party's(ies') operating rights and interests in production from such well shall be vested in the Participating Parties in proportion to their Participating Interest, whether or not any instrument evidencing a transfer of rights and interests has been delivered by the Non-Participating Party(ies).  The Participating Party(ies) shall have the right to recoup the costs applicable to such well as determined by Section 12.2 and/or Section 12.5 and the drilling of such well shall be governed by Article 12, except that the percentage of recoupment as provided in Section 12.2.1 (a) shall be eight hundred percent (800%) of the Non-Participating Party's Share of the cost of drilling the well.
 
If the well is not commenced within the time period provided in Section 10.1, the effect shall be as if the proposal had not been made.
 
21
10.5           Substitute Well.  If, prior to reaching the proposed depth or objective zone or zones to be tested for the Initial Exploratory Well or Exploratory Well as originally proposed, the Participating Party or Parties encounter mechanical difficulties, inpenetrable formation, and/or Gulf Coast conditions which render drilling impractical, then the Participating Party of Parties, or any of them, shall have the right, but not the obligation, to carry out the original proposed operation by drilling a Substitute Well.  Operations for the Substitute Well shall be commenced within sixty (60) days after the date the drilling operations cease on the well for which the Substitute Well is a substitute.  Operations for the Substitute Well shall be commenced as if it were the original proposed Initial Exploratory Well or Exploratory Well for which it is the substitute; and the relationship, rights and obligations as between the Participating Party and Non-Participating Party or Parties shall be the same as if the Substitute Well were, in fact, the proposed Initial Exploratory Well or Exploratory Well, as applicable.
 
22
10.6           Course of Action After Drilling to Initial Objective Depth.  At such time as an Exploratory Well has been drilled to the initial objective depth as proposed, or a mutually agreed upon lesser depth, and all approved logs, cores, and other tests have been completed, and the results thereof furnished to the Participating Parties, Operator shall notify the Participating Parties setting forth Operator's recommendation to either:
 
 
(a)
Conduct additional coring, testing, or logging of the formations encountered.  (If conflicting proposals are approved, the proposal receiving the largest percentage of Working Interest approval shall take precedence.  In the event of a tie between two or more approved proposals, the approved proposal first received by the Parties shall take precedence.)
 
(b)
Run casing and temporarily abandon the well for future completion.  (This election is not applicable for a well drilled from a Platform.)
 
(c)
Attempt completion, with a deeper completion having priority over a shallower completion attempt.  (If conflicting proposals for a single completion and a dual completion are approved, the proposal receiving the largest Working Interest shall take precedence.  Provided however, if the proposal taking precedence is a dual completion, then the dual must either include the zone approved for the single completion or provide for the completion in zones all of which are deeper than the zone approved for the single completion.)
 
(d)
Deepen the well.  (If conflicting proposals are approved, the operation proposed to the deepest depth shall take precedence.)
 
(e)
Sidetrack the well to another bottom hole location not deeper than the stratigrephic equivalent of the initial objective depth.
 
(f)
Perform other operations on the well. (If conflicting proposals are approved, the proposal receiving the largest percentage of Working Interest approval shall take precedence.  In the event of a tie between two or more approved proposals, the approved proposal first received by the Parties shall take precedence.)
 
(g)
Plug and abandon the well.
 
The Participating Parties, within twenty-four (24) hours, inclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal Holidays, after receipt of Operator's recommendation, shall respond thereto by either approving it or making another proposal.  If another proposal is made, the Participating Parties shall have an additional twenty-four (24) hours, inclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays, to respond thereto.  If conflicting proposals are made, the priority of operations shall be given first to (a) above and next to (b) above and so forth.  Failure of a Participating Party to respond to a proposal shall be deemed a negative response.
 
23
10.6.1
Operation by All Parties.  Subject to Section 10.6.4, if all Participating Parties approve a proposal, Operator shall conduct the operation at the Participating Parties’ cost and risk.
 
10.6.2
Operations by Fewer than All Parties.  If one (1) or more Parties having a combined Participating Interest in the well of twenty percent (20%) or more approve a proposal and agree to bear the cost, risk and liabilities (including loss of the hole due to deepening of any well) thereof, except a proposal to plug and abandon, Operator shall conduct the same as a Non-Consent Operation for such Parties pursuant to the provisions of Article 12, except that the percentage of recoupment as provided in Section 12.2.1(a) shall be the same as provided for in Section 10.4(b).  If no proposal receives the required approval, the well shall be plugged and abandoned at the expense of all Participating Parties unless any Participating Party notifies Operator within twenty-four (24) hours, inclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays, after the end of the last applicable election period that it desires to immediately assume all costs and risks including liabilities of further operations, in which event Operator shall, as promptly as possible, commence the proposed operation pursuant to the provisions of Article 12.  In the event there is more than one (1) Participating Party, each of which is willing to assume all costs, risks and liabilities of further operations, but each desires to perform a different operation, then the order of priority as listed above herein shall prevail and govern.
10.6.3
Obligations and Liabilities of Participating Parties.  If the decision is to complete at initial objective depth, to plug back and complete at a lesser depth, to deepen or to Sidetrack to another bottomhole location, a Party, by becoming a Non-Participating Party, shall be relieved of the obligations and liabilities as to such operation, except as to its share of the costs of plugging and abandoning that portion of the well in which it was a Participating Party.
 
10.6.4
Deepening or Sidetracking of Non-Consent Exploratory Well.  Subject to the terms of Section 10.6 above, if drilling to the initial objective depth does not result in a well which will be qualified as a Producible Well and the decision is to drill deeper or Sidetrack, each Non-Participating Party shall be notified by the Operator of such decision.  Any Non-Participating Party may then agree to participate in a deepening or Sidetracking operation by notifying the Operator, within forty-eight (48) hours, inclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays, after receiving notice of the decision.  In such event any Non-Participating Party which elects to participate in deepening or Sidetracking the well as proposed shall immediately pay to the Participating Parties its Participating Interest share of the costs of the well as if it had originally participated to the initial objective depth or that point the Sidetracking operation is commenced if lesser than the initial objective depth.  Thereafter such Non-Participating Party shall be deemed for all purposes to be a Participating Party as to such deepening or Sidetracking operations, and the provisions of Section 10.4 shall not be applicable to such Party as to the deepened or Sidetracked portion of the well.  The initial Participating Parties, however, shall continue to be entitled to recoup out of the proceeds received from production from the non-consent portion of the Non-Consent Well any balance remaining pursuant to the terms specified in Section 10.4 applicable to such Non-Consent Well, less the amount paid by a Non-Participating Party pursuant to this Section 10.6.4.
 
 
 
24
 
10.6.5
Plugging and Abandoning Cost.  The Participating Parties shall pay all costs of plugging and abandoning except any costs associated with a subsequent Non-Consent Operation.  The participants in a subsequent Non-Consent Operation shall pay any plugging and abandoning costs associated with such operation.  A Non-Consent Operation does not include the abandonment of the original wellbore above the depth at which the Non-Consent Operation commenced.

ARTICLE 11
DEVELOPMENT OPERATIONS

11.1           Operations by All Parties.  Any Party may propose Development Operations, including any wells (whether drilling, completing, recompleting, deepening, deviating or Sidetracking, plugging back or working over), Platform,  Facilities and/or Subsequent Facilities required by such operations, by submitting a Development Operation AFE to the other Parties for approval pursuant to the response to notice procedures set forth in Article 9.  If all Parties elect to participate in the proposed operation, Operator shall conduct such operation at their cost and risk.


11.2           Second Opportunity to Participate.  If fewer than all but one (1) or more Parties having a combined Working Interest of twenty percent (20%) or more elect to participate, the Operator shall inform the Parties of the elections made, whereupon any Party originally electing not to participate may then elect to participate by notifying the Operator within forty-eight (48) hours, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays.  This provision shall apply only in the event that there are three (3) or more Parties to this Agreement.
 
11.3           Final Election to Participate.  If fewer than all but one (1) or more Parties having a combined Working Interest of twenty percent (20%) or more approve any proposed operation, the Operator, immediately after the expiration of the applicable response time, shall inform the Parties who have elected to participate of the total interest of the Parties approving such operation.  Each Participating Party, within forty-eight (48) hours, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays, after receipt of such notice, shall advise the Operator of its desire to: (a) limit participation to such Party's interest as shown on the proposed AFE; or (b) carry its proportionate part of Non-Participating Parties interests.  Failure to advise the proposing Party shall be deemed an election under (a), notwithstanding Section 9.4.  Should any Party elect to limit its participation to its interest as shown on the proposed AFE, the remaining Participating Parties shall carry the Non-Participating Parties interest in such proportions as the remaining Participating Parties agree to by mutual consent.  In the event a drilling rig is on location, the time permitted for any response under this Article 11 shall not exceed a total of twenty-four (24) hours, inclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays.  This provision shall apply only in the event that there are three (3) or more Parties to this Agreement.
 
25
11.4           Operations by Fewer Than All Parties.  If fewer than all but one (1) or more Parties having a combined Working Interest of twenty percent (20%) or more elect to participate in and agree to bear all of the cost, risk and liability of a Development Operation, Operator shall conduct such operation pursuant to Article 12.
 
11.5           Timely Operations.  Development Operations shall be commenced within one hundred twenty (120) days following the date upon which the last applicable election may be made; however, the one hundred twenty (120) day period shall automatically be extended for an additional period, not to exceed sixty (60) days, as may be necessary, in order to obtain all applicable required regulatory permits so long as applications for such required permits were properly filed within thirty (30) days after the last applicable election date.  If no operations are commenced within such time period, the effect shall be as if the proposal had not been made.  Operations shall be deemed to have commenced: (a) on the date the contract for a new Platform is let, if the notice indicated a need for such Platform, or (b) on the date the rig charges begin according to the terms of the drilling contract.  For all other Development Operations, Development Operations shall be deemed to have commenced on the day charges are incurred pursuant to an approved AFE.


11.6           Substitute Well.  If, prior to reaching the proposed depth or objective zone or zones to be tested for the Development Operation as originally proposed, the Participating Party or Parties encounter mechanical difficulties, inpenetrable formation, and/or Gulf Coast conditions which render further drilling impossible, then the Participating Party of Parties, or any of them, shall have the right, but not the obligation, to carry out the original proposed operation by drilling a Substitute Well.  Operations for the Substitute Well shall be commenced within sixty (60) days after the date the drilling operations cease on the well for which the Substitute Well is a substitute.  Operations for the Substitute Well shall be commenced were the original proposed Development Operation for which it is the substitute, and the relationship, rights and obligations as between the Participating Party and Non-Participating Party or Parties shall be the same as if the Substitute Well were, in fact, the proposed Development Operation, as applicable.
 
26
11.7           Course of Action After Drilling to Initial Objective Depth.  At such time as a Development Well has been drilled to the initial objective depth as proposed and all approved logs, cores and other tests have been completed and the results thereof furnished to the Participating Parties, Operator shall notify the Participating Parties setting forth Operator's recommendation to either:
 
 
(a)
Conduct additional coring, testing, or logging of the formations encountered.  (If conflicting proposals are approved, the proposal receiving the largest percentage of Working Interest approval shall take precedence.  In the event of a tie between two or more approved proposals, the approved proposal first received by the Parties shall take precedence.)
 
(b)
Run casing and temporarily abandon the well for future completion.  (This election is not applicable for a well drilled from a Platform.)
 
(c)
Attempt completion, with a deeper completion having priority over a shallower completion attempt.  (If conflicting proposals for a single completion and a dual completion are approved, the proposal receiving the largest Working Interest shall take precedence.  Provided however, if the proposal taking precedence is a dual completion, then the dual must either include the zone approved for the single completion or provide for the completion in zones all of which are deeper than the zone approved for the single completion.)
 
(d)
Deepen the well.  (If conflicting proposals are approved, the operation proposed to the deepest depth shall take precedence.)
 
(e)
Sidetrack the well to another bottom hole location not deeper than the stratigraphic equivalent of the initial objective depth;
 
(f)
Perform other operations on the well.  (If conflicting proposals are approved, the proposal receiving the largest percentage of Working Interest approval shall take precedence.  In the event of a tie between two or more approved proposals, the approved proposal first received by the Parties shall take precedence.)
 
(g)
Plug and abandon the well.
 
The Participating Parties, within forty-eight (48) hours, inclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays, after receipt of Operator's recommendation, shall respond thereto by either approving it or making another proposal.  If another proposal is made, the Participating Parties shall have an additional twenty-four (24) hours to respond thereto.  If conflicting proposals are made, the priority of operations shall be given first to (a) above and next to (b) above and so forth.  Failure of a Participating Party to respond to a proposal shall be deemed a negative response.
 
27
11.7.1          Operations by All Parties.  If all Participating Parties approve a proposal, Operator shall conduct the operation at the Participating Parties' cost and risk.
 
11.7.2          Operations by Fewer than All Parties.  If fewer than all but one (1) or more Parties having a combined Participating Interest in the well of twenty percent (20%) or more approve a proposal and agree to bear the cost, risk, and liabilities (including loss of the hole due to deepening of any well) thereof, except a proposal to plug and abandon, Operator shall conduct the same as a Non-Consent Operation for such Parties pursuant to the provisions of Article 12.  If no proposal receives the required approval, the well shall be plugged and abandoned at the expense of all Participating Parties unless any Participating Party notifies Operator within twenty-four (24) hours after the end of the last applicable election period that it desires to immediately assume all costs and risks including liabilities of further operations, in which event Operator shall, as promptly as possible, commence the proposed operation pursuant to the provisions of Article 12.  In the event there is more than one (1) Party, each of which is willing to assume all costs, risks and liabilities of further operations, but each desires to perform a different operation, then the order of priority as listed above herein shall prevail and govern.
 
11.7.3          Obligations and Liabilities of Participating Parties.  If the decision is to complete at initial objective depth, to plug back and complete at a lesser depth, to deepen or to Sidetrack to another bottomhole location, a Party, by becoming a Non-Participating Party, shall be relieved of the obligations and liabilities as to such operation, except as to its share of the costs of plugging and abandoning that portion of the well in which it was a Participating Party.

11.8           Deeper Drilling.  If a well is proposed to be drilled below the deepest Producible Reservoir penetrated by a Producible Well, any Party may elect to participate either in the well as proposed or to the base of the deepest Producible Reservoir.  A Party electing to participate in such well to the base of said Producible Reservoir shall bear its proportionate part of the cost and risk of drilling to said Producible Reservoir including completion or abandonment. All operations below the depth to which such Party agreed to participate shall be governed by Article 12.  However, if the proposal to drill below the deepest Producible Reservoir penetrated by a Producible Well meets the requirements of an Exploratory Operation, the percentage of recoupment shall be that specified in Section 10.4(b) and shall be subject to the provisions of Article 10 with respect to such operations.
 
                11.9           Plugging and Abandoning Cost.  The Participating Parties shall pay all costs of plugging and abandoning except any costs associated with a subsequent Non-Consent Operation.  The participants in a subsequent Non-Consent Operation shall pay any plugging and abandoning costs associated with such operation.  A Non-Consent Operation does not include the abandonment of the original wellbore above the depth at which the Non-Consent Operation commenced.
 
28
                11.10         Subsequent Facilities.  The affirmative vote of one (1) or more Parties having a combined Participating Interest of fifty-one percent (51%) or more in the wells to be served by the proposed Subsequent Facilities shall constitute approval for the construction of such Subsequent Facilities and all Parties having an interest in the wells to be served shall be bound by such approval and be required to participate in the costs therefor.  Nothing hereunder shall limit a Party's rights under Section 21.1 to incur additional costs for separate facilities.
 
                11.11         Contracts.  Operator may enter into contracts with independent contractors for Development Operations and shall utilize competitive bidding.

ARTICLE 12
NON-CONSENT OPERATIONS

                12.1           Non-Consent Operations.  Operator shall conduct Non-Consent Operations at the sole risk, expense, and liability of the Participating Parties, in accordance with the following provisions:
 
12.1.1
Non-Interference.  Non-Consent Operations shall not interfere unreasonably with any other operations being conducted within the Contract Area.
 
12.1.2
Multiple Completion Limitation.  Non-Consent Operations shall not be conducted in a well having multiple completions unless: (a) each completion is owned by the same Parties participating in the Non-Consent Operations and in the same proportions; (b) the well is incapable of producing from any of its completions; or (c) all Participating Parties in the well consent to such operations.
12.1.3
Metering.  In Non-Consent Operations, production need not be separately metered, but subject to approval by appropriate governmental authority, may be determined on the basis of well tests.
 
12.1.4
Non-Consent Well.  Operations on a Non-Consent Well shall not be conducted in any Producible Reservoir penetrated by a Producible Well without written approval of each Non-Participating Party unless these four (4) conditions are satisfied: (a) such Producible Reservoir shall have been designated in the notice as an objective zone; (b) completion of such well in said Producible Reservoir will not increase the well density governmentally prescribed or approved for such Producible Reservoir; (c) the horizontal distance between the vertical projections of the midpoint of the Producible Reservoir in such well and any existing well in the same Producible Reservoir will be at least one thousand (1,000) feet if an oil-well completion or two thousand (2,000) feet if a gas-well completion; and (d) completion of such well as a producer will not cause or result in a decreased "MER" or "MPR" for any existing Producible Reservoir or Producible Well.  The terms "MER" and "MPR" are defined under 30 Code of Federal Regulations, Subpart K-Production rates, Parts 250.170 through 250.177.
 
 
 
29
 
 
12.1.5
Cost Information.  Operator shall, within one hundred twenty (120) days after completion of a Non-Consent Well, furnish the Parties an inventory and either a joint interest billing or an itemized statement of the cost of such well and equipment pertaining thereto.  Operator shall furnish to the Parties a quarterly statement showing operating expenses and the proceeds from the sale of production from the well for the preceding three (3) month period.  When Operator’s payout calculation indicates that payout has occurred, Operator shall promptly notify all Parties.
 
12.1.6
Completion.  For the purposes of determinations hereunder, each completion shall be considered a separate well.
 
12.2                         Forfeiture of Interest.  Upon commencement of Non-Consent Operations, each Non-Participating Party's leasehold operating rights in the Non-Consent Operation and title to production therefrom shall be owned by and vested in each Participating Party in proportion to its Participating Interest or in proportions agreed to by the Participating Parties for as long as the operations originally proposed are being conducted or production is obtained, subject to the following:
 
12.2.1
Production Reversion.  Such leasehold operating rights and title to production shall revert to each Non-Participating Party at 7:00 a.m. on the day following the date when the Participating Parties have recouped out of the Non-Participating Party's Share of the proceeds of production from such Non-Consent Operations an amount, which when added to any amounts received under Section 12.3, equals the sum of the following:

    (a) 
Six hundred percent (600%) of the Non-Participating Party's Share of the cost of drilling, testing, completing, recompleting, working over, deepening, deviating or Sidetracking, plugging back, or temporarily plugging and abandoning each Non-Consent Well (or any Non-Consent Operation(s) in a joint well), and equipping it through the wellhead connections, reduced by any contribution received under Article 20; plus
 
 
(b)
Three hundred percent (300%) of the Non-Participating Party's Share of the cost of any Non-Consent Facilities necessary to establish the production resulting from the operations defined in Section 12.2.1.(a) above; plus
 
(c)
Three hundred percent (300%) of the Non-Participating Party's Share of the cost of any Platform in which it does not participate and which must be installed to establish the production resulting from the operations defined in Section 12.2.1.(a) above; plus,
 
(d)
Three hundred percent (300%) of the Non-Participating Party's Share of the cost of using any existing Platform, whether or not owned by the Joint Account; plus,
 
(e)
Three hundred percent (300%) of the Non-Participating Party's Share of the cost of using any existing Facilities not owned by the Joint Account, including leased facilities; plus
 
(f)
One hundred percent (100%) of the Non-Participating Party's Share of gathering, treating, and operating expenses, royalties, and severance, production, and other similar taxes.
 
At 7:00 a.m. upon the day following the date of recoupment of such costs, a Non-Participating Party shall become a Participating Party in such operations.
 
30
12.2.2
Non-Production Reversion.  If such Non-Consent Operations fail to obtain production or if such operations result in production which ceases prior to recoupment by the Participating Parties of the penalties provided for above, such operating rights shall revert to each Non-Participating Party except that all wells (or portions thereof associated with any Non-Consent Operation(s) in a joint well), Platforms and Facilities of the Non-Consent Operations, as well as all liabilities and benefits related thereto, shall remain vested in the Participating Parties; however, any salvage in excess of the sum remaining under Section 12.2.1 shall be credited to all Parties.
 
 
12.3             Deepening or Sidetracking of Non-Consent Development Well.  If any Participating Party proposes to deepen or Sidetrack a Non-Consent Development Well, a Non-Participating Party may participate by notifying the Operator within thirty (30) days after receiving the proposal (forty-eight (48) hours, inclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays, if a rig is on location) that it will join in the deepening or Sidetracking operation and by paying to the Participating Parties; 1) if it is a deepening an amount equal to the costs of the well as if such Non-Participating Party had originally participated to the objective depth or; 2) if it is a sidetrack operation an amount equal to the Non-Participating Parties share of drilling the non-consent well to that point the Sidetracking operation is commenced.  The Participating Parties shall continue to be entitled to recoup the full sum specified in Section 12.2.1 applicable to the non-consent portion of the well out of the proceeds received from production from the non-consent portion of the well, less any amount received under this Section 12.3.


12.4           Operations from Non-Consent Platforms and Facilities.  Subject to the following, a Party which did not originally participate in a Platform or Facilities shall be a Non-Participating Party as to ownership therein and all operations thereon until the Participating Parties as to such Platform or Facilities have recouped the full sum specified in Section 12.2.1 applicable to such non-consent Platform or Facilities and the Non-Consent Operations which resulted in the setting of such Platform or Facilities and other Non-Consent Operations thereon or therefrom.  However, any original Non-Participating Party may participate in additional operations from such Platform or Facilities by notifying the Operator within thirty (30) days after receiving a proposal for operations from such Platform or Facilities that it will join in such proposed operations by paying to the Participating Parties in such Platform or Facilities an amount equal to the non-consent penalty provided for in Section 12.2.1 applicable to such Non-Participating Party’s Share of the actual cost of such Platform or Facilities, less any recoupment therefor previously obtained.  Thereafter, such original Non-Participating Party in such non-consent Platform or Facilities shall own its proportionate share thereof.  The Participating Parties in such non-consent Platform or Facilities shall continue to be entitled to recoup the full sum specified in Section 12.2.1 applicable to any other Non-Consent Operations thereon or therefrom.
 
31
12.5           Discovery or Extension from Mobile Drilling Operations.  If a Non-Consent Well is drilled from a mobile drilling rig or floating drilling vessel and results in the discovery of oil or gas or extension of a Producible Reservoir and, if within one (1) year from the date the drilling equipment is released, a Platform or other fixed structure is ordered and if its location is within three thousand (3,000) feet from the vertical projection of the bottom-hole location of any such well (unless limited by surface restrictions or seabed conditions), the recoupment of costs applicable to such well shall be governed by Section 12.2 and shall be recovered by the Participating Parties in the following manner:
 
 
(a)
If such Non-Consent Well is not completed and produced, recoupment shall be out of one-half (1/2) of the Non-Participating Party's Share of production from all subsequently completed wells on the Contract Area which are completed in the Producible Reservoir discovered or extended by such Non-Consent Well and in which the Non-Participating Party in such Non-Consent Well has a Participating Interest.
 
(b)
If such Non-Consent Well is completed and produced, recoupment shall be out of the Non-Participating Party's Share of all production from such Non-Consent Well and one-half (1/2) of the Non-Participating Party's Share of production from all subsequently completed wells on the Contract Area which are completed in the Producible Reservoir discovered or extended by such Non-Consent Well and in which the Non-Participating Party in such Non-Consent Well has a Participating Interest.
 
        12.6           Non-Consent Operations to Maintain Lease.  Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if a Lease has no wells thereon capable of commercial production in the final six (6) months of the primary term of such Lease and such Lease is not held by a unit or a Suspension of Production pursuant to other operations on the Lease or in the unit, any Party electing not to participate in the drilling of a well or other operation in the final six (6) months of the primary term or at any time during the secondary term, shall assign its full interest in such Lease pro-rata to the Parties hereto undertaking the drilling of such well or participating in such operation.  Such assignment shall be executed and delivered within thirty (30) days after commencement of the well or operation.  If at any time after the expiration of the primary term of a Lease, a well must be drilled or an operation conducted because of cessation of production or to fulfill an obligation to develop such Lease, such well or operation being required to extend the term of such Lease or a portion thereof, any Party electing not to participate in the operation or the drilling of such a well shall assign its full interest in that Lease, or portion thereof, pro-rata to the Parties hereto undertaking the drilling of such a well.  Such assignment shall be executed and delivered within thirty (30) days after commencement of the well or operation, but shall be limited to the portion of the Lease the term of which was extended by the operation or drilling the well, and provided any Non-Participating Party shall retain its rights and liabilities with respect to any previously completed wells on that Lease and the production therefrom.  Thereafter, that Lease shall no longer be a part of the Contract Area, and the Non-Participating Party or Parties shall no longer own an interest in any wells drilled on such Lease, other than those wells drilled prior to the occurrence set out herein.  Should the Parties electing to undertake the drilling of a well or conduct operations under this Section 12.6 fail to perform, as Participating Parties, the drilling of the well or operations substantially as proposed, the Parties receiving the aforementioned assignment shall assign back to the Party or Parties originally electing not to participate, that interest which was caused to be assigned pursuant to this Section 12.6.  A Party hereunder executing an assignment of its interest in a Lease pursuant to the foregoing shall not be relieved of any obligation hereunder accruing prior to such assignment.  If more than one (1) well is drilled or more than one (1) operation conducted, any of which would maintain or extend such Lease or such portions thereof, an assignment shall not be required from any Party participating in any such well(s) or operation(s) as to that portion of the Lease or unit which would have been maintained by such well(s) or operation(s).

12.7          Allocation of Platform Costs to Non-Consent Operations.  Non-Consent Operations shall be subject to further conditions as follows:
 
12.7.1
Charges.  If a Non-Consent Well is drilled from a Platform, the Participating Parties in such well shall be liable to the Joint Account owners of the Platform for the use of the Platform and its Facilities as follows:
 
 
(a)
Such Participating Parties shall pay a sum equal to that portion of the total cost of the Platform which one (1) Platform slot bears to the total number of slots on the Platform.  If the Non-Consent Well is abandoned, the right of Participating Parties to use that Platform slot shall terminate, unless such Parties commence drilling a substitute well from the same slot within ninety (90) days after abandonment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Non-Consent Well is abandoned as an unsuccessful well, and no substitute well is drilled by the Participating Parties, then, if the slot is abandoned in a condition such that it could be used for the drilling of a future well, the Participating Parties shall not be required to pay the sum set out in this Section 12.7.1.
 
(b)
If the Non-Consent Well production is handled through the Facilities, the Participating Parties shall pay a sum equal to that portion of the total cost of such Facilities, less accumulated depreciation, which one (1) well completion bears to the total number of Producible Well completions utilizing the Facilities.
 
 
 
 
33
 
12.7.2
Operating and Maintenance Charges.  The Participating Parties shall pay on a monthly basis all costs necessary to connect a Non-Consent Well to the Facilities and that proportionate part of the expense of operating and maintaining the Platform and Facilities applicable to the Non-Consent Well.  Platform and Facilities operating and maintenance expenses shall be allocated in proportion to the producing well count during a calendar month as it relates to the total number of wells producing from such Platform during such calendar month.  For the purpose of this provision, a producing zone or each completion in a multi-completed well shall be considered as a separate well.
 
12.7.3
Payments.  Payment of sums pursuant to Section 12.7.1 is not a purchase of an additional interest in the Platform or Facilities.  Such payments, if the recoupment provisions of Section 12.2 are applicable, shall be included in the total amount which the Participating Parties are entitled to recoup out of production from the Non-Consent Well.
 
12.8        Allocation of Costs Between Depths (Single Completion).  For the purpose of allocating costs on any well with a single completion in which the Participating Interests of the Parties are not the same for the entire depth or the completion thereof, the cost of drilling, completing, equipping, and plugging and abandoning such well shall be allocated on the following basis:
       
    (a)      Intangible drilling, completion, casing string, and material costs from the surface to a depth one hundred feet (100') below the base of the Producible Reservoir in which the well is completed shall be charged to the Participating Parties in such completion in accordance with their respective Participating Interest.
 
(b)
Intangible drilling, completion, casing string, and material costs, other than tubing costs, from a depth of one hundred feet (100') below the base of the Producible Reservoir in which the well is completed to total depth shall be charged to the Participating Parties in the well to total depth in accordance with their respective Participating Interest.
 
(c)
All plugging and abandonment costs directly associated with the Producible Reservoir in which the well is completed will be allocated to the Participating Parties in that completion in accordance with their respective Participating Interests.  All final plugging and abandonment costs associated with the wellbore will be allocated proportionately among all Participating Parties in the well.
 
 
 
34
 
 
12.9        Allocation of Costs Between Depths (Multiple Completions).  For the purpose of allocating costs on any well completed in dual or multiple Producible Reservoirs in which the Participating Interests of the Parties are not the same for the entire depth or the completion thereof, the cost of drilling, completing, equipping, and plugging and abandoning such well shall be allocated on the following basis:
 
 
(a)
Intangible drilling, completion, casing string, and material costs other than tubing costs, from the surface to a depth one hundred feet (100') below the base of the upper completed Producible Reservoir shall be divided equally between the completed Producible Reservoirs and charged to the Participating Parties in each Producible Reservoir in accordance with their respective Participating Interest.
 
(b)
Intangible drilling, completion, casing string, and material costs, other than tubing, from a depth one hundred feet (100') below the base of the upper completed Producible Reservoir to a depth one hundred feet (100') below the base of the second completed Producible Reservoir shall be divided equally between the second and any other Producible Reservoir completed below such depth and charged to the Participating Parties in each such Producible Reservoir in accordance with their respective Participating Interest.  If the well is completed in additional Producible Reservoirs, the costs applicable to each such Producible Reservoir shall be determined and charged to the Participating Parties in the same manner as prescribed for wells completed in dual Producible Reservoirs.
 
(c)
Intangible drilling, completion, casing string, and material costs, other than tubing costs, from a depth one hundred feet (100') below the base of the lowest completed Producible Reservoir to total depth shall be charged to the Participating Parties in the well to total depth in accordance with their respective Participating Interest.
 
(d)
Costs of tubing strings serving each separate Producible Reservoir shall be charged to the Participating Parties in each Producible Reservoir in accordance with their respective Participating Interest.
 
(e)
For the purposes of allocating tangible and intangible costs between Producible Reservoirs that occur at less than one hundred feet (100') intervals, the distance between the base of the upper reservoir to the top of the next lower reservoir shall be allocated equally between reservoirs.
 
(f)
All plugging and abandonment costs directly associated with a Producible Reservoir will be allocated to the Participating Parties in that reservoir in accordance with their respective Participating Interests.  All final plugging and abandonment costs associated with the wellbore will be allocated proportionately among all Participating Parties in the well.
 
 
 
35
12.10       Allocation of Costs Between Depths (Dry Hole).  For the purpose of this Section, a dry hole shall mean a well drilled to an objective depth in which the Participating Parties elected not to complete, or if completed, the well was not a Producible Well and did not establish a Producible Reservoir.  In allocating costs on any well containing a dry hole, and in which the Participating Interests of the Parties are not the same for the entire depth or the completion thereof, the cost of drilling and plugging and abandoning such well shall be allocated on the following basis:
 
 
(a)
Costs to drill and plug and abandon a well proposed for completion in single, dual, or multiple objective depths shall be charged to the Participating Parties in the same manner as if the well had established a Producible Reservoir at each objective depth.
 
(b)
Additional plugging and abandoning costs related to any deepening, completion attempt, or other operation shall be at the sole risk and expense of the Participating Parties in such operation.
 
12.11      Intangible Drilling and Completion Cost Allocations.  For the purposes of allocating costs under Sections 12.8, 12.9, and 12.10, intangible drilling and completion costs, including non controllable materials costs, shall be allocated between Producible Reservoirs, including dry holes as defined in Section 12.10, and including the interval from one hundred feet (100') below the deepest Producible Reservoir to total depth on a drilling day ratio basis where the factor for each reservoir is determined by a fraction for which the numerator is the number of drilling and completion days applicable to that reservoir and the denominator is the total number of days spent on the well, beginning on the day the rig arrives on location and terminating when the rig is released.
 
12.12       Subsequent Operations in Non-Consent Well.  Except as provided in Section 10.6.4 or 12.3, as applicable, an election not to participate in the drilling, Sidetracking, or deepening of a well shall be deemed to be an election not to participate in any subsequent operations in the well before full recovery by the Participating Parties of the Non-Participating Party's recoupment amount.  A subsequent operation conducted during the recoupment period by the Parties entitled to participate shall be subject to the recoupment provided in Section 12.2.1.

ARTICLE 13
ABANDONMENT AND SALVAGE

13.1           Platform Salvage and Removal Costs.  When the Parties owning a Platform mutually agree to dispose of such Platform, it shall be disposed of by the Operator as approved by such Parties with such Parties having a preferential right to acquire the Platform.  The costs, risks, and net proceeds, if any, resulting from such disposition shall be shared by such Parties in proportion to their ownership of the Platform.
 
13.2           Abandonment of Producing Well.  Any Participating Party may propose the abandonment of a well by notifying the other Participating Parties.  No well shall be abandoned without the unanimous approval of the Participating Parties.  The Participating Parties not consenting to the abandonment shall pay to each Participating Party desiring to abandon such abandoning Party's share of the current value of the well's salvageable material and equipment as determined pursuant to Exhibit "C", less the estimated current costs of salvaging same and of plugging and abandoning the well as determined by the Participating Parties.  In the event such abandoning Party's interest in such salvage value is less than such Party's share of the estimated costs of salvaging materials, plugging and abandoning, the abandoning Party shall pay the Operator, for the benefit of the non-abandoning Parties, a sum equal to the deficiency.
 
13.3           Assignment of Interest.  Each Participating Party desiring to abandon a well pursuant to Section 13.2 shall assign effective as of the last applicable election date, to the non-abandoning Parties, in proportion to their Participating Interests, its interest in such well and the equipment therein and its ownership in the production from such well.  Any Party so assigning shall be relieved, after delivering the assignment, from any further liability with respect to said well, and each non-abandoning Party shall assume and bear all such liabilities in proportion to the share of interest that it receives from the abandoning Parties.  Notwithstanding Section 13.2, no Party shall be required to accept an assignment of an interest of a Party desiring to abandon a well.  If no Party is willing to accept the assignment, the Party seeking to abandon the well shall remain an owner in the well.
 
13.4           Abandonment Operations Required by Governmental Authority.  Any well abandonment or Platform removal required by a governmental authority shall be accomplished by Operator with the costs, risks, and net proceeds, if any, to be shared by the Parties owning such well or Platform in proportion to their Participating Interests.



ARTICLE 14
WITHDRAWAL

14.1           Withdrawal.  A Party may withdraw from this Agreement by assigning to the other Parties who do not desire to withdraw, all of its interest in the Contract Area and the wells, Platforms and Facilities used in operations thereon; provided that such assignment shall not relieve such Party from any obligation or liability incurred prior to the first day of the month following receipt of the assignment by assignees.  The assigned interest shall be owned by the assignees in proportion to their respective Participating Interests.  The assignees, in proportion to the respective interests so acquired, shall pay the assignor for its interest in the wells, Platforms and Facilities, the current salvage value thereof less its share of the estimated current cost of salvaging same, plugging and abandoning of wells, and removal of all Platforms and Facilities, as determined by the Parties.  In the event such withdrawing Party's interest in such salvage value is less than such Party's share of the estimated costs, the withdrawing Party shall pay the Operator, for benefit of the non-withdrawing Parties, a sum equal to the deficiency.  Within ninety (90) days after receiving notice of the assignment, Operator shall render a final statement to the withdrawing Party for its share of all expenses incurred through the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the assignment, plus any deficiency in salvage value.  Providing all such expenses, including any deficiency hereunder due from the withdrawing Party have been paid within thirty (30) days after the rendering of such final statement, the assignment shall be effective the first day of the month following its receipt, and the withdrawing Party shall thereafter be relieved from all further obligations and liabilities with respect to the Contract Area; provided, however, that such withdrawing Party shall remain liable for any costs, expenses, or damages theretofore accrued or arising out of any event accruing prior to such Party's withdrawal.
 
37
14.2           Limitations on Withdrawal.  No Party shall be relieved of its obligations hereunder during a blowout, a fire, or other emergency, but may withdraw from this Agreement after termination of such emergency, provided such Party shall remain liable for its share of all costs arising from said emergency.  Notwithstanding Section 14.1, no Party shall be required to accept an assignment of a withdrawing Party's interest.

A transfer, relinquishment, or other disposition of interests in the Leases between Parties under Section 12.6 (Non-Consent Operations to Maintain Lease); Article 14 (Withdrawal); or Section 15.3 (Non-participation in Payments) shall be made without warranty of title. Any such transfer between the Parties, if applicable, shall be free and clear of all overriding royalty, production payment, net profits interest, mortgage, lien, security interest, or other burden or encumbrance, other than lessor’s royalty burdens and the Permitted Encumbrance shown on Exhibit “A”.

25.5           Division of Interest. If, at any time, the interest of a Party is divided among and owned by four (4) or more co-owners, Operator, at its discretion, may require the co-owners to appoint a single trustee or agent with full authority to receive notices, approve expenditures, receive billings for, and approve and pay the Party’s share of the joint expenses, and to deal generally with, and with power to bind the co-owners of the Party’s interest within the scope of the operations embraced in this Agreement. All such co-owners may separately dispose of their respective shares of the oil, gas, and condensate produced from the Contract Area and may receive, separately, payment of the sale proceeds thereof.
 
25.6           Preferential Rights. If a Party desires to transfer, sell, farmout, assign, or otherwise dispose of all or part of its Working Interest (“Disposing Party”), it shall promptly give written notice to the other Parties with full information about the proposed transaction, including, but not limited to, the name and address of the prospective transferee (who must be ready, willing, and able to acquire the interest and deliver the stated consideration therefor), the consideration for the transfer, farmout terms, and all other terms of the offer. In the case of a package sale of oil and gas interests that includes all or part of the Disposing Party’s Working Interest, or if the proposed transaction is structured as a non-simultaneous, like-kind exchange under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“Code”), the Working Interest that is subject to this preferential right shall be separately valued and the notice shall state the value attributed to the interest by the prospective transferee. The other Parties shall then have an optional prior right, for a period of thirty (30) days after receipt of the notice, to elect to purchase or acquire on the same terms and conditions, or on equivalent terms for a non-cash transaction, all of the Working Interest that the Disposing Party is proposing to transfer. If this preferential right is exercised by a Party, the purchasing or acquiring Parties shall share the purchased or acquired interest in the proportions that the Working Interest of each bears to the total Working Interest of all acquiring Parties, or in such proportions as the acquiring Parties otherwise agree. This preferential right shall apply separately to each Working Interest or part thereof covered by this Agreement, regardless of whether it is included in the proposed transaction along with other oil and gas interests, whether as a sale, farmout, or non-simultaneous, like-kind exchange, and no provision in this Agreement shall be interpreted to defeat this preferential right. Upon exercise of this preferential right, the acquiring Parties shall agree to perform all obligations of the prospective transferee under the proposed transaction only for the Working Interest subject to the proposed transaction. This preferential right, however, shall not exist or apply when a Party proposes (a) to mortgage its interest; (b) to dispose of or transfer its interest to an Affiliate by (i) merger, (ii) reorganization, or (iii) consolidation; (c) to sell all, or substantially all, of its exploration and production properties located in the United States of America; or (d) to transfer the interest under a property exchange transaction other than a non-simultaneous, like-kind exchange under Section 1031 of the Code. If the proposed transaction is not consummated within six (6) months after receipt of the notice by the other Parties, the Working Interest shall again be governed by this Section 25.6 and the preferential right shall again arise for the offered interest as herein described.

2.           Tax Reporting Partner and Tax Matters Partner

2.1           Tax Reporting Partner.
 
The Operator (or the Party listed in Sec. 9.1) as the Tax Reporting Partner (“TRP”) is responsible for compliance with all tax reporting obligations of the Partnership, see Sec. 3.1. below. In the event of any change in the TRP, the Party serving as the TRP at the beginning of a given taxable year shall continue as TRP with respect to all matters concerning such year.

2.2           IF SMALL PARTNERSHIP EXCEPTION FROM TEFRA NOT APPLICABLE
 
If the Partnership does not qualify for the “small partnership exception” from, or if the Partnership elects (see infra Elections at Sec. 4.1 and 9.2) to be subject to, §§6221 et seq., Subchapter C of Chapter 63 of Subtitle F (the “TEFRA rules”) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) the TRP shall also be the Tax Matters Partner as defined in Code §6231(a) (the “TMP”) and references to the TRP shall then include references to TMP and vice versa.
 
2.2.1
The TMP shall not be required to incur any expenses for the preparation for, or pursuance of, administrative or judicial proceedings, unless the Parties agree on a method for sharing such expenses.
 
2.2.2
The Parties shall furnish the TMP, within two weeks from the receipt of the request, the information the TMP may reasonably request to comply with the requirements on furnishing information to the Internal Revenue Service.
 
2.2.3
The TMP shall not agree to any extension of the statute of limitations for making assessments on behalf of the Partnership without first obtaining the written consent of all Parties. The TMP shall not bind any other Party to a settlement agreement in tax audits without obtaining the written concurrence of any such Party.
 
2.2.4
Any other Party who enters in a settlement agreement with the Secretary of the Treasury with respect to any partnership items, as defined in Code §6231(a)(3), shall notify the other Parties of the terms within ninety (90) days from the date of such settlement.
 
2.2.5
If any Party intends to file a notice of inconsistent treatment under Code §6222(b), such Party shall, prior to filing of such notice, notify the TMP of the (actual or potential) inconsistency of the Party’s intended treatment of a partnership item with the treatment of that item by the Partnership. Within one week of receipt the TMP shall remit copies of such notification to the other Parties. If an inconsistency notice is filed solely because a Party has not received a Schedule K-1 in time for filing of its income tax return, the TMP need not be notified.
 
2.2.6
No Party shall file pursuant to Code §6227 a request for an administrative adjustment of partnership items (the “RFAA”) without first notifying all other Parties. If all other Parties agree with the requested adjustment, the TMP shall file the RFAA on behalf of the Partnership. If unanimous consent is not obtained within thirty (30) days from such notice, or within the period required to timely file the RFAA, if shorter, any Party, including the TMP, may file a RFAA on its own behalf.
 
2.2.7
Any Party intending to file with respect to any partnership item, or any other tax matter involving the Partnership, a petition under Code §§6226, 6228, or any other provision, shall notify the other Parties prior to such filing of the nature of the contemplated proceeding. In the case where the TMP is the Party intending to file such petition, such notice shall be given within reasonable time to allow the other Parties to participate in the choice of the form of such petition. If the Parties do not agree on the appropriate forum, then the forum shall be chosen by majority vote. Each Party shall have a vote in accordance with its percentage interest in the Partnership for the year under audit. If a majority cannot agree, the TMP shall choose the forum. If a Party intends to seek review of any court decision rendered as a result of such proceeding, the Party shall notify the other Parties prior to seeking such review.

Tax and FMV Capital Account Elections

4.1        General Elections.
 
For both income tax and capital account purposes, the Partnership shall elect:
 
a)
to deduct when incurred intangible drilling and development costs (“IDC”);
b)
to use the maximum allowable accelerated tax method and the shortest permissible tax life for depreciation;
c)
the accrual method of accounting;
d)
to report income on a calendar year basis; and the Partnership shall also make any elections as specially noted in Sec.9.2, below.

F-4
4.2        Depletion.
 
Solely for FMV capital account purposes, depletion shall be calculated by using simulated cost depletion within the meaning of Treas. Reg. §1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(k)(2), unless the use of simulated percentage depletion is elected in Sec.9.2, below. The simulated cost depletion allowance shall be determined under the principles of Code  §612 and be based on the FMV capital account basis of each Lease. Solely for purposes of this calculation, remaining shall be determined consistently by the TRP.

4.3        Election Out Under Code §761(a).
 
4.3.1
The TRP shall notify all Parties of an intended election to be excluded from the application of Subchapter K of Chapter 1 of the Code not later than sixty (60) days prior to the filling date or due date (including extensions) for the Federal partnership income tax return, whichever comes earlier. Any Party that does not consent must provide the TRP with written objection within thirty (30) days of such notice. Even after an effective election-out the TRP’s right and obligations, other than the relief from tax return filing obligations of the partnership, continue.
 
4.3.2
After an election-out, to avoid an unintended impairment of the election-out: The Parties will avoid, without prior coordination, any operational changes which could terminate the qualification for the election-out status; all Parties will monitor the continuing qualification of the Partnership for the election-out status and will notify the other Parties if, in their opinion, a change in operations will jeopardize the election-out; and, all Parties will use, unless agreed to by them otherwise, the cumulative gas balancing method as described in Treas. Reg. §1.761-2(d)(2).
 

4.4        Consent Requirements For Subsequent Tax Or FMV Capital Account Elections.
 
Unless stipulated differently in Sec. 9.3, future elections, in addition to or in amendment of those in this agreement, must be approved by the affirmative vote of two (2) or more Parties owning a majority of the working interest based upon post-Payout ownership.

5.
Capital Contributions and FMV Capital Accounts
 
The provisions of this Sec. 5 and any other provisions of the TPPs relating to the maintenance of the capital accounts are intended to comply with Treas. Reg. §1.704-1(b) and shall be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with such regulations.

5.1        Capital Contributions.
 
The respective capital contributions of each Party to the Partnership shall be (a) each Party’s interest in the oil and gas lease(s), including all associated lease and well equipment, committed to the Partnership, and (b) all accounts of money paid by each Party in connection with the acquisition, exploration, development, and operation of the lease(s), and all other costs characterized as contributions or expenses borne by such Party under the Agreement. The contribution of the leases and any other properties committed to the Partnership shall be made by each Party’s agreement to hold legal title to its interest in such leases or other property as nominee of the Partnership.

F-5
5.2        FMV Capital Accounts.
 
The FMV capital accounts shall be increased and decreased as follows:
 
5.2.1
The FMV capital account of a Party shall be increased by:
 
(i)
the amount of money and the FMV (as of the date of contribution) of any property contributed by such Party to the Partnership (net of liabilities assumed by the Partnership or to which the contributed property is subject);
(ii)
that Party’s share of Partnership items of income or gain, allocated in accordance with Sec. 6.1; and
(iii)
that Party’s share of any Code §705(a)(1)(B)item.
 
5.2.2
The FMV capital account of a Party shall be decreased by:
 
(i)
the amount of money and the FMV of property distributed to a Party (net of liabilities assumed by such Party or to which the property is subject):
(ii)
that Party’s Sec. 6.1 allocated share of Partnership loss and deductions, or items thereof; and,
(iii)
that Party’s share of any Code §705(a)(2)(B) item.
 
5.2.3
The “FMV” when it applies to property contributed by a Party to the Partnership shall be assumed, for purposes of Sec.5.2.1, to equal the adjusted tax basis, as defined in Code § 1011, of that property unless the Parties agree otherwise as indicated in Sec. 9.2.
 
5.2.4
As provided in Treas. Reg. §1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(e), upon distribution of Partnership property to a Party the capital accounts will be adjusted to reflect the manner in which the unrealized income, gain, loss and deduction inherent in distributed property (not previously reflected in the capital accounts) would be allocated among the Parties if there were a disposition of such property at its FMV as of the time of distribution. Furthermore, if so agreed to in Sec. 9.2, under the rules of Treas. Reg. §1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f), the FMV capital accounts shall be revalued at certain times to reflect value changes of the Partnership property.
 
5.2.5
The provisions of section 5 is intended to satisfy the requirements of section 704(b) of the Code and section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv) of the Treasury Regulations and shall be so construed and, if necessary, modified, to cause the allocation of profits, losses, income, gain and credit under section 6, to have substantial economic effect under such sections of the Code and Regulations, and in the event of any conflict between the provisions of this section 5.2 and such Regulations, the Regulations shall control.


F-6
6.
Partnership Allocations.

6.1           FMV Capital Account Allocations.
 
Each item of income, gain, loss or deduction shall be allocated to each Party as follows:
 
6.1.1
Actual or deemed income from the sale, exchange, distribution or other disposition of production shall be allocated to the Party entitled to such production or the proceeds from the sale of such production. The amount received from the sale of production and the amount of the FMV of production taken in kind by the Parties are deemed to be identical; accordingly, such items may be omitted from the adjustments made to the Parties’ FMV capital accounts.
 
6.1.2
Exploration cost, IDC, operating and maintenance cost shall be allocated to each Party in accordance with its respective contribution, or obligation to contribute, to such cost.
 
6.1.3
Depreciation shall be allocated to each Party in accordance with its contributions, or obligations to contribute, to the cost of the underlying asset.
 
6.1.4
Simulated depletion shall be allocated to each Party in accordance with its FMV capital account adjusted basis in each oil and gas property of the Partnership.
 
6.1.5
Loss (or simulated loss) upon the sale, exchange, distribution, abandonment or other disposition of depreciable or depletable property shall be allocated to the Parties in the ratio of their respective FMV capital account adjusted bases n the depreciable or depletable property.
 
6.1.6
Gain (or simulated gain) upon the sale, exchange, distribution, or other disposition of depreciable or depletable property shall be allocated to the Parties so that the FMV capital account balances of the Parties will most closely reflect their respective percentage of fractional interests under the Agreement.
 
6.1.7
Costs or expenses of any other kind shall be allocated to each Party in accordance with its respective contribution, or obligation to contribute, to such cost or expense.
 
6.1.8
Any other income item shall be allocated to the Parties in accordance with the manner in which such income is realized by each Party.
 
6.2           Tax return and Tax Basis Capital Account allocations.
 
6.2.1
Unless otherwise expressly provided in the Sec. 6.2, the allocations of the Partnership’s items of income, gain, loss, or deduction for tax return and tax basis capital account purposes shall follow the principles of the allocation under Sec. 6.1. However, the Partnership’s gain or loss on the taxable disposition of a Partnership property in excess of the gain or loss under Sec 6.1, if any, is allocated to the contributing Party to the extent of such Party’s pre-contribution gain or loss.
 
6.2.2
The Parties recognize that under Code §613A(c)(7)(D) the depletion allowance is to be computed separately by each Party. For this purpose, each Party’s share of the adjusted tax basis in each oil and gas property shall be equal to its contribution to the adjusted tax basis of such property.
 
6.2.3
Under Code §613A(c)(7)(D) gain or loss on the disposition of an oil and gas property is to be computed separately by each Party. According to Treas. Reg. §1.704-1(b)(4)(v), the amount realized shall be allocated as follows: (i) An amount that represents recovery of the adjusted simulated depletion basis is allocated (without being credited t the capital accounts) to the Parties in the same proportion as the aggregate simulated depletion basis was allocated to such Parties under Sec. 5.2; and (ii) any remaining realization is allocated in accordance with Sec. 6.1.6.
 
6.2.4
Depreciation shall be allocated to each Party in accordance with its contribution to the adjusted tax basis of the depreciable asset.
 
6.2.5
In accordance with Treas. Reg. §1.1245-I(c), depreciation  recapture shall be allocated, to the extent possible, among the Parties to reflect their prior sharing of the depreciation.
 
6.2.6
In accordance with the principles of Treas. Reg. §1.1254-5, any recapture of IDC is determined and reported by each Party separately. Similarly, any recapture of depletion shall be computed separately by each Party, in accordance with its depletion allowance computed pursuant to Sec. 6.2.2.
 
6.2.7
For Partnership properties with FMV capital account values different from their adjusted tax bases the Parties intend that the allocations described in the Section 6.2 constitute a “reasonable method” of allocating gain or loss under Treas. Reg. §1.704-3(a)(1).
 
6.2.8
Take-in-kind.
 
If checked “Yes” in Sec. 9.2, below, each Party has the right to determine the market for its proportionate share of production. All items of income, deductions, and credits arising from such marketing of production shall be recognized by the Partnership and shall be allocated to the Party whose production is so marketed.


F-7
7.        Termination and Liquidating Distribution

7.1           Termination of the Partnership.
 
7.1.1
Upon termination, as provided in Code §708(b)(I)(A), the business shall be wound-up and concluded, and the assets shall be distributed to the Parties as described below by the end of such calendar year (or, if later, within ninety (90) days after the date of such termination). The assets shall be valued and distributed to the Parties in the order provided in Secs. 7.1.2, 7.5. and 7.7.
 
7.1.2
First, all cash representing unexpended contributions by any Party and any property in which no interest has been earned by any other Party under the Agreement shall be returned to the contributor.
 
7.2           Balancing of FMV Capital Accounts.
 
Second, the FMV capital accounts of the Parties shall be determined as described hereafter. The TRP shall take the actions specified under Secs. 7.2 through 7.5 in order to cause the ratios of the Parties’ FMV capital accounts to reflect as closely as possible their interests under the Agreement. The ratio of a Party’s FMV capital account is represented by a fraction, the numerator of which the Party’s FMV capital account balance and the denominator of which is the sum of all Parties’ FMV capital account balances. This is thereafter referred to as the “balancing of the FMV capital accounts” and, when completed, the FMV capital accounts of the Parties shall be referred to as “balanced”.
 

7.3           Deemed Sale Gain/Loss Charge Back.
 
The FMV of all Partnership properties shall be determined and the gain or loss for each property, which would have resulted if sold at such FMV, shall be allocated in accordance with Secs. 6.1.5 and 6.1.6.

7.4        Deficit make-up Obligation and Balancing Cash Contributions.
 
If hereafter a Party has a negative FMV capital account balance, that is a balance of less than zero, in accordance with Treas. Reg. §1.1704-I(b)(2)(ii)(b)(3) such Party is obligated to contribute, by the end of the taxable year, or if later, within ninety (90) days form the Partnership’s liquidation, an amount of money to the Partnership sufficient to achieve a zero balance FMV capital account (the “Deficit Make-Up Obligation”). Moreover, any Party may contribute an amount of cash to the Partnership to facilitate the balancing of the FMV capital accounts. If after these adjustments the FMV capital accounts are not balanced, Sec. 7.5 shall apply.

7.5           Distribution to balance capital accounts.
 
7.5.1
If all Parties agree, any cash or an undivided interest in certain selected properties shall be distributed to one or more Parties as necessary for the purpose of balancing the FMV capital accounts.
 
7.5.2
Distribution of undivided interests.
 
Unless Sec. 7 applies, an undivided interest in each and every property shall be distributed to one or more Parties in accordance with the ratios of their FMV capital accounts.

7.6           FMV determinations.
 
If a property is to be valued for purposes of balancing the capital accounts and making distributions under this Sec. 7, the Parties must first attempt to agree on the FMV of the property; failing such an agreement, the TRP shall cause a nationally recognized independent engineering firm to prepare an appraisal of the FMV of such property.

7.7           Final Distribution.
 
After the FMV capital accounts of the Parties have been adjusted pursuant to Secs. 7.2 to 7.5, all remaining property and interests then held by the Partnership shall be distributed to the Parties in accordance with their positive FMV capital account balances.

F-8

ARTICLE 4
OPERATOR

4.1           Operator. RIDGELAKE ENERGY, INC. is hereby designated as Operator for the purposes of this Agreement, and for all operations conducted on or related to the Contract Area.
 
4.2           Resignation or Removal of Operator.  Operator may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to Non-Operators.  In addition, Operator may be removed by the affirmative vote of the Parties owning a combined Working Interest of fifty-one percent (51%) or more after excluding Operator’s Working Interest if:
 
 
(a)
Operator becomes insolvent or unable to pay its debts as they mature, makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, commits an act of bankruptcy, or seeks relief under laws providing for the relief of debtors; or
 
(b)
a receiver is appointed for Operator or for substantially all of its property or affairs.
 
(c)
Operator sells, trades, transfers or assigns all or a portion of its Working Interest, thereby reducing its Working Interest to less than ten percent (10%); or
 
(d)
Operator commits a substantial breach of a material provision of this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within sixty (60) days after receipt of a Non-operator’s notice to Operator of such breach.
 
 
4
 
The resignation or removal of the Operator shall become effective as soon as practical, but not later than 7:00 o'clock a.m. on the first day of the calendar month following a period of ninety (90) days after i) the date of notice of resignation by Operator or ii) the date of receipt of written notice by Operator from Non-Operator detailing the alleged grounds for removal and Operator has failed to cure same within sixty (60) days from its receipt of the notice, unless a longer period is required for the Parties to obtain approval of the designation of the successor Operator by the MMS; however, in no event shall the resignation or removal of Operator become effective until a successor Operator has assumed the duties of Operator.  Upon approval of the designation of the successor Operator by the MMS, the resigning or removed Operator shall be bound by the terms of this Joint Operating Agreement as a Non-Operator.  A change of a corporate name or structure of Operator or transfer of Operator’s interest to any single subsidiary, parent or successor corporation shall not be the basis for removal of Operator.
 
4.3           Selection of Successor.  Upon resignation or removal of Operator, a successor Operator shall be selected by an affirmative vote of the Parties having a combined majority Working Interest.  However, if the removed or resigned Operator fails to vote or votes only to succeed itself, the successor Operator shall be selected by an affirmative vote of the Parties having a combined Working Interest of fifty-one percent (51%) or more of the remaining Working Interest left after excluding the Working Interest of the removed or resigned Operator.  In no event shall the resignation or removal of Operator become finally effective unless and until a successor Operator has been elected and assumed its duties.
 
4.4   Delivery of Property.  Prior to the effective date of resignation or removal, the former Operator shall deliver to the successor Operator all records and data relating to the operations conducted by the former Operator that the successor Operator is entitled to have and that are not already in the possession of the successor Operator, as well as all other property in the possession of the former Operator that was acquired for the Joint Account.
 
4.5           Liability of Operator.  If Operator resigns, or if Operator is removed as Operator, such resignation, or removal shall not relieve Operator of any liabilities it may have to Non-Operator(s) or third parties for damages arising out of Operator's breach of this Agreement.
 
4.6           Removal and Selection of a Successor Operator in a Two-party Agreement.  If this Agreement involves only two parties, the following provisions shall apply:
 
 
4.6.1  On the occurrence of an event specified in Section 4.2 that allows removal of Operator, Non-Operator shall have the option of either becoming Operator or allowing Operator to continue in that position.
 
 
4.6.2  If Operator resigns, Non-Operator, at its option, shall have the option of either becoming Operator or terminating this Agreement.
 
4.7           Designation of Operator.  The Parties hereto agree to execute such Designation of Operator forms as are required to have the Operator or its successor properly designated as operator with the Minerals Management Service or any other governmental authority having jurisdiction over the Lease and the operations conducted thereunder.

ARTICLE 5
AUTHORITY AND DUTIES OF OPERATOR

5.1           Exclusive Right to Operate.  Unless otherwise provided, Operator shall have the exclusive right to conduct all operations pursuant to this Agreement.  In performing services under this Agreement for the Non-Operator, Operator shall be an independent contractor, not subject to the control or direction of Non-Operator, except for the type of operation to be undertaken in accordance with the voting and election procedures contained within this Agreement.  Operator shall not be deemed to be, or hold itself out as, the agent or fiduciary of Non-Operator.
 
5
5.2           Workmanlike Conduct.  Operator shall conduct all operations in a good and workmanlike manner as would a prudent operator under the same or similar circumstances.  Operator shall not be liable to Non-Operator for losses sustained or liabilities incurred, except such as may result from Operator’s gross negligence or willful misconduct.  Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, Operator shall consult with Non-Operator and keep them informed of all important matters.  However, Operator shall never be required under this Agreement to conduct an operation that it believes would be unsafe or would endanger persons or property.
 
5.3           Liens and Encumbrances.  Operator shall endeavor to keep the Lease within the Contract Area and equipment free from all liens and encumbrances occasioned by operations hereunder, except those provided for in Section 8.5 (Security Rights).
 
5.4           Employees.  The number of employees and their selection, and the hours of labor and compensation for services performed shall be determined by Operator.  Except as provided in Exhibit “C”, such employees shall be the employees of Operator.
 
5.5           Records.  Operator shall keep accurate books, accounts, and records of operations under this Agreement, which, unless otherwise provided for in this Agreement, shall be available to Non-Operator as provided in Exhibit "C".
 
5.6           Compliance.  Operator shall comply with, and require all agents and contractors to comply with, all applicable laws, rules, regulations and orders of any governmental authorities having jurisdiction.
 
5.7           Contractors.  Operator may enter into contracts with independent contractors for the design, construction, installation, or operation of Platforms and Facilities.  Insofar as possible, Operator shall use competitive bidding to procure goods and services for the benefit of the Parties.  All drilling operations conducted under this Agreement shall be conducted by qualified and responsible drilling contractors under current competitive contracts.  A drilling contract will be deemed to be a current competitive contract if it (a) was made within one hundred (180) days before the commencement of the well and (b) contains terms, rates, and provisions that, when the contract was made, did not exceed those generally prevailing in the area for operations involving substantially equivalent rigs that are capable of drilling the proposed well.  At its election, Operator may use its own or an Affiliate’s drilling equipment, derrick barge, tools, or machinery to conduct drilling operations, but the work shall be (a) performed by Operator acting as an independent contractor, (b) approved by written agreement with the Participating Parties before commencement of operations, and (c) conducted under the same terms and conditions and at the same rates as are customary and prevailing in competitive contracts  of third parties doing work of a similar nature.  Before awarding a drilling contract or performing work with its own or an Affiliate’s drilling equipment, derrick barge, tools, or machinery, Operator shall attempt to obtain competitive bids for the work from independent contractors.
 
6
5.8           Governmental Reports.  Operator shall make reports to governmental authorities that it has a duty to make as Operator and shall furnish copies of such reports to the Participating Parties.

(a)
A copy of application for permit to drill and all amendments thereto.
 
(b)
Daily drilling reports.
 
(c)
A complete report of all core analyses, if any.

Non-Operator shall give Operator at least twenty-four (24) hours’ notice of Non-Operator’s intention to visit the Lease.  To protect Operator and Non-Operator from unnecessary lawsuits, claims, and legal liability, if it is necessary for a person who is not performing services for Operator directly related to a joint operation, but is performing services solely for a Non-Operator or pertaining to the business or operations of a Non-Operator, to visit, use, or board a rig, Platform, or Facility on a Lease subject to this agreement, the Non-Operator shall give Operator advance notice of the visit, use or boarding, and shall secure from that person an agreement, in a form satisfactory to Operator, indemnifying and holding Operator and Non-Operator harmless, or shall itself provide the same hold harmless and indemnification in favor of Operator and the other Non-Operators before the visit, use, or boarding.
 
7.2           Reports.  Upon written request, Operator shall furnish a requesting Party any information not otherwise furnished under Article 5 to which such Party is otherwise entitled under this Agreement.

7.3           Confidentiality.  For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "Confidential Information" shall mean any geological, geophysical, engineering, technical, production test, exploratory, or reservoir information, or any logs or other information pertaining to any well drilled pursuant to this Agreement or any operation conducted under the terms of this Agreement to the extent that such information was acquired at joint expense.  Except as provided in Section 7.5 and except for necessary disclosures to governmental authorities having jurisdiction, no Party shall during the term of this Agreement and for a period of three (3) years thereafter, trade, sell, publish or release any such Confidential Information without the agreement of all Participating Parties.  Otherwise, the Parties shall jointly own all such Confidential Information without duty to account.  Each Party's obligation to protect Confidential Information shall be considered met by each Party using at least the same degree of care as it uses in protecting its own proprietary materials of like kind.
 
7.4           Exceptions.  No Party shall have any obligation to limit disclosure or use any portion of Confidential Information which:
 
 
(a)
is already in that Party's possession prior to receipt as a result of this Agreement;
 
(b)
is now in or hereafter becomes publicly available through no fault of that Party;
 
(c)
is disclosed to that Party without obligation of confidence by a third party which has the right to make such disclosure; or;
 
(d)
is independently developed by or for such Party without reference to information received under this Agreement.
 
 
7.5           Limited Disclosure.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Parties may make Confidential Information available to third parties as follows:

third parties with whom a party is engaged in a bona fide effort to effect a merger or consolidation, sell all or a controlling part of that Party’s stock, or sell all or substantially all assets of that Party or an Affiliate of that Party;
 
(g)
an Affiliate of a Party; and
 
(h)
third parties with whom a Party is engaged in a bona fide effort to sell, farmout, or trade all or a portion of its interest in the Lease.
 
Confidential Information made available under Subsections 7.4(f) and 7.4(h) shall not be removed from the custody or premises of the Party making the Confidential Information available to third parties as described in those Subsections.  Also, a third party permitted access under Subsections 7.4(a), (b), (c), (f) and (h) shall first agree in writing neither to disclose the Confidential Information to others nor to use the Confidential Information, except for the purpose for which it was disclosed.  The disclosing Party shall give prior notice to the other Parties that it intends to make the Confidential Information available.
 
7.6           Proceeds.  During the term of this Agreement, the Parties agree that any proceeds obtained from the sale of Confidential Information (excluding, however, transfers of Confidential Information incidental to a Party’s sale of all or any portion of its interest in the Contract Area) shall be shared by the Parties in proportion to their share of the total costs and expenses to acquire same.
 
7.7           Media Releases.  Except as agreed by all parties or otherwise permitted by this Section, no Party shall issue a news or media release about operations on the Lease.  In an emergency involving extensive property damage, operations failure, loss of human life, or other clear emergency, and for which there is insufficient time to obtain the prior approval of the Parties, Operator may furnish the minimum, strictly factual, information necessary to satisfy the legitimate public interest of the media and governmental authorities having jurisdiction.  Operator shall then promptly advise the other Parties of the information furnished in response to the emergency.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, upon prior written notice to the other Parties, a Party shall be allowed to make any press release or announcement required by a recognized stock exchange on which the Party’s (or its Affiliate’s) stock is listed; provided, however, that the press release shall contain the following statement: “The information, opinions or
projections contained in this press release are (the disclosing Party’s) and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of its co-owners.”

EXPENDITURES

8.1           Basis of Charge to the Parties.

8.2           Authorization.  Prior to undertaking any project or making any single expenditure related to the Contract Area in excess of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00), Operator shall submit for the approval of the Parties an Authorization for Expenditure ("AFE") for such project or expenditure.  Operator shall furnish written information to all the Parties on any project or single expenditure costing less than One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00) but in excess of Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00) if Operator prepares same for its own use.  Notwithstanding the One Hundred Thousand Dollar ($100,000.00) limitation, where such project or expenditure involves changing zones in a well or a workover operation, an AFE shall be submitted to the Parties for approval.  Approval of a Development Well or an Exploratory Well operation shall include approval of all necessary expenditures through drilling, coring and logging to the objective depth and plugging and abandoning costs, if applicable.  In the event of an actual or imminently threatened blowout, explosion, accident, fire, flood, storm, or other emergency, Operator may immediately conduct such operations and make such expenditures as in its opinion are required to overcome the emergency, including, but not limited to, any and all measures to protect life, health, safety, property, natural resources or the environment.  Operator shall report to the Parties, as promptly as possible, the nature of the emergency and action taken.  The Operator shall provide supplemental AFE’s to Participating Parties, for informational purposes only, if it reasonably determines that the expected actual costs of an operation will exceed the amount of the approved AFE by 15% or more, but only if the dollar amount of such expected excess is greater than Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000.00).
 
10
8.3           Advance Billings.  Operator shall have the right to require each Party to advance its respective share of estimated expenditures pursuant to Exhibit "C".

8.5           Security Rights (Louisiana).

11
(a)           Mortgage in Favor of the Operator.  Each Non-operator hereby grants to the Operator a mortgage, hypothecate, and pledge of and over all of its rights, titles, and interests in and to (a) the Lease within the Contract Area, (b) the oil, gas and other minerals in, on, under, and that may be produced from the lands within the Contract Area, and (c) all other immovable property susceptible of mortgage situated within the Contract Area.
 
This mortgage is given to secure the complete and timely performance of and payment by each Non-operator of all obligations and indebtedness of every kind and nature, whether now owed by such Non-operator or hereafter arising, pursuant to this Agreement.  To the extent susceptible under applicable law, this mortgage and the security interests granted in favor of the Operator herein shall secure the payment of all costs and other expenses properly charged to such Party, together with (A) interest on such indebtedness, costs, and other expenses at the rate set forth in Exhibit "C" attached hereto (the "Accounting Procedure") or the maximum rate allowed by law, whichever is the lesser, (B) reasonable attorneys' fees, (C) court costs, and (D) other directly related collection costs.  If any Non-operator does not pay such costs and other expenses or perform its obligations under this Agreement when due, the Operator shall have the additional right to notify the purchaser or purchasers of the defaulting Non-operator's production of oil, gas and other minerals and collect such costs and other expenses out of the proceeds from the sale of the defaulting Non-operator's share of production of oil, gas and other minerals until the amount owed has been paid.  The Operator shall have the right to offset the amount owed against the proceeds from the sale of such defaulting Non-operator's share of production of oil, gas and other minerals.  Any purchaser of such production shall be entitled to rely on the Operator's statement concerning the amount of costs and other expenses owed by the defaulting Non-operator and payment made to the Operator by any purchaser shall be binding and conclusive as between such purchaser and such defaulting Non-operator.
 
The maximum amount for which the mortgage herein granted by each Non-operator shall be deemed to secure the obligations and indebtedness of such Non-operator to the Operator as stipulated herein is hereby fixed in an amount equal to $25,000,000.00 (the "Limit of the Mortgage of each Non-operator").  Except as provided in the previous sentence (and then only to the extent such limitations are required by law), the entire amount of obligations and indebtedness of each Non-operator to the Operator is secured hereby without limitation.  Notwithstanding the foregoing Limit of the Mortgage of each Non-operator, the liability of each Non-operator under this Agreement and the mortgage and security interest granted hereby shall be limited to (and the Operator shall not be entitled to enforce the same against such Non-operator for, an amount exceeding) the actual obligations and indebtedness [including all interest charges, costs, attorneys' fees, and other charges provided for in this Agreement or in the Memorandum of Operating Agreement and Financing Statement (Louisiana), as such term is defined in Article 8.5.(e) (Recordation) hereof] outstanding and unpaid and that are attributable to or charged against the interest of such Non-operator pursuant to this Agreement.

To secure the complete and timely performance of and payment by each Non-operator of all obligations and indebtedness of every kind and nature, whether now owed by such Non-operator or hereafter arising, pursuant to this Agreement, each Non-operator hereby grants to the Operator a continuing security interest in and to all of its rights, titles, interests, claims, general intangibles, proceeds, and products thereof, whether now existing or hereafter acquired, in and to (a) all oil, gas and other minerals produced from the lands or offshore blocks covered by the Leases within the Contract Area or attributable to the Leases within the Contract Area when produced, (b) all accounts receivable accruing or arising as a result of the sale of such oil, gas and other minerals (including, without limitation, accounts arising from gas imbalances or from the sale of oil, gas and other minerals at the wellhead), (c) all cash or other proceeds from the sale of such oil, gas and other minerals once produced, and (d) all Platforms and Facilities, wells, fixtures, other corporeal property, whether movable or immovable, whether now or hereafter placed on the lands or offshore blocks covered by the Leases within the Contract Area or maintained or used in connection with the ownership, use or exploitation of the Leases within the Contract Area, and other surface and sub-surface equipment of any kind or character located on or attributable to the Leases within the Contract Area and the cash or other proceeds realized from the sale, transfer, disposition or conversion thereof.  The interest of the Non-operators in and to the oil and gas produced from or attributable to the Leases within the Contract Area when extracted and the accounts receivable accruing or arising as the result of the sale thereof shall be financed at the wellhead of the well or wells located on the Leases within the Contract Area.  To the extent susceptible under applicable law, the security interest granted by each Non-operator hereunder covers: (A) all substitutions, replacements, and accessions to the property of such Non-operator described herein and is intended to cover all of the rights, titles and interests of such Non-operator in all movable property now or hereafter located upon or used in connection with the Leases within the Contract Area, whether corporeal or incorporeal; (B) all rights under any gas balancing agreement, farmout rights, option farmout rights, acreage and cash contributions, and conversion rights of such Non-operator in connection with the Leases within the Contract Area, or the oil, gas and other minerals produced from or attributable to the Leases within the Contract Area, whether now owned and existing or hereafter acquired or arising, including, without limitation, all interests of each Non-operator in any partnership, tax partnership, limited partnership, association, joint venture, or other entity or enterprise that holds, owns, or controls any interest in the Leases within the Contract Area; and (C) all rights, claims, general intangibles, and proceeds, whether now existing or hereafter acquired, of each Non-operator in and to the contracts, agreements, permits, licenses, rights-of-way, and similar rights and privileges that relate to or are appurtenant to the Leases within the Contract Area, including the following:

(2)           all of its rights, titles, and interests, whether now owned and existing or hereafter acquired or arising, in, to, and under or derived from all presently existing and future advance payment agreements, and oil, casinghead gas, and gas sales, exchange, and processing contracts and agreements, including, without limitation, those contracts and agreements that are described on Exhibit "A," to the extent, and only to the extent, those contracts and agreements cover or include all or any portion of the Leases within the Contract Area; and
 
(3)           all of its rights, titles, and interests, whether now owned and existing or hereafter acquired or arising, in, to, and under or derived from all existing and future permits, licenses, rights-of-way, and similar rights and privileges that relate to or are appurtenant to the Leases within the Contract Area.
 
(c)           Mortgage in Favor of the Non-operators.  The Operator hereby grants to each Non-operator a mortgage, hypothecate, and pledge of and over all of its rights, titles, and interests in and to (a) the Lease within the Contract Area; (b) the oil, gas and other minerals in, on, under, and that my be produced from the lands within the Lease within the Contract Area; and (c) all other immovable property or other property susceptible of mortgage situated within the Lease within the Contract Area.
 
 
14
This mortgage is given to secure the complete and timely performance of and payment by the Operator of all obligations and indebtedness of every kind and nature, whether now owed by the Operator or hereafter arising, pursuant to this Agreement.  To the extent susceptible under applicable law, this mortgage and the security interests granted in favor of each Non-operator herein shall secure the payment of all costs and other expenses properly charged to the Operator, together with (A) interest on such indebtedness, costs, and other expenses at the rate set forth in Exhibit “C” or the maximum rate allowed by law, whichever is the lesser, (B) reasonable attorneys' fees, (C) court costs, and (D) other directly related collection costs.

The Non-operators shall have the right to offset the amount owed against the proceeds from the sale of the Operator’s share of production of oil, gas and other minerals.  Any purchaser of such production shall be entitled to rely on the Non-operators’ statement concerning the amount of costs and other expenses owed by the Operator and payment made to the Non-operators by any purchaser shall be binding and conclusive as between such purchaser and the Operator.
 
The maximum amount for which the mortgage herein granted by the Operator shall be deemed to secure the obligations and indebtedness of the Operator to all Non-operators as stipulated herein is hereby fixed in an amount equal to $25,000,000.00 in the aggregate (the "Limit of the Mortgage of the Operator").  Except as provided in the previous sentence (and then only to the extent such limitations are required by law), the entire amount of obligations and indebtedness of the Operator to the Non-operators is secured hereby without limitation.  Notwithstanding the foregoing Limit of the Mortgage of the Operator, the liability of the Operator under this Agreement and the mortgage and security interest granted hereby shall be limited to (and the Non-operators shall not be entitled to enforce the same against the Operator for, an amount exceeding) the actual obligations and indebtedness [including all interest charges, costs, attorneys' fees, and other charges provided for in this Agreement or in the Memorandum of Operating Agreement and Financing Statement (Louisiana), as such term is defined in Article 8.5.(e) hereof] outstanding and unpaid and that are attributable to or charged against the interest of the Operator pursuant to this Agreement.
 
15
(d)           Security Interest in Favor of the Non-operators.  To secure the complete and timely performance of and payment by the Operator of all obligations and indebtedness of every kind and nature, whether now owed by the Operator or hereafter arising, pursuant to this Agreement, the Operator hereby grants to each Non-operator a continuing security interest in and to all of its rights, titles, interests, claims, general intangibles, proceeds, and products thereof, whether now existing or hereafter acquired, in and to (a) all oil, gas and other minerals produced from the lands or offshore blocks covered by the Leases within the Contract Area or included within the Leases within the Contract Area or attributable to the Leases within the Contract Area when produced, (b) all accounts receivable accruing or arising as a result of the sale of such oil, gas and other minerals (including, without limitation, accounts arising from gas imbalances or from the sale of oil, gas and other minerals at the wellhead), (c) all cash or other proceeds from the sale of such oil, gas and other minerals once produced, and (d) all Platforms and Facilities, wells, fixtures, other corporeal property whether movable or immovable, whether now or hereafter placed on the offshore blocks covered by the Leases within the Contract Area or maintained or used in connection with the ownership, use or exploitation of the Leases within the Contract Area, and other surface and sub-surface equipment of any kind or character located on or attributable to the Leases within the Contract Area and the cash or other proceeds realized from the sale, transfer, disposition or conversion thereof.  The interest of the Operator in and to the oil, gas and other minerals produced from or attributable to the Leases within the Contract Area when extracted and the accounts receivable accruing or arising as the result of the sale thereof shall be financed at the wellhead of the well or wells located on the Leases within the Contract Area. To the extent susceptible under applicable law, the security interest granted by the Operator hereunder covers: (A) all substitutions, replacements, and accessions to the property of the Operator described herein and is intended to cover all of the rights, titles and interests of the Operator in all movable property now or hereafter located upon or used in connection with the Leases within the Contract Area, whether corporeal or incorporeal; (B) all rights under any gas balancing agreement, farmout rights, option farmout rights, acreage and cash contributions, and conversion rights of the Operator in connection with the Leases within the Contract Area, the oil, gas and other minerals produced from or attributable to the Leases within the Contract Area, whether now owned and existing or hereafter acquired or arising, including, without limitation, all interests of the Operator in any partnership, tax partnership, limited partnership, association, joint venture, or other entity or enterprise that holds, owns, or controls any interest in the Leases within the Contract Area; and (C) all rights, claims, general intangibles, and proceeds, whether now existing or hereafter acquired, of the Operator in and to the contracts, agreements, permits, licenses, rights-of-way, and similar rights and privileges that relate to or are appurtenant to the Leases within the Contract Area, including the following:
 
(1)           all of its rights, titles, and interests, whether now owned and existing or hereafter acquired or arising, in, to, and under or derived from any present or future operating, farmout, bidding, pooling, unitization, and communitization agreements, assignments, and subleases, whether or not described in Exhibit "A," to the extent, and only to the extent, that such agreements, assignments, and subleases cover or include any of its rights, titles, and interests, whether now owned and existing or hereafter acquired or arising, in and to all or any portion of the Leases within the Contract Area, and all units created by any such pooling, unitization, and communitization agreements and all units formed under orders, regulations, rules, or other official acts of any governmental authority having jurisdiction, to the extent and only to the extent that such units cover or include all or any portion of the Leases within the Contract Area;
 
16
(2)           all of its rights, titles, and interests, whether now owned and existing or hereafter acquired or arising, in, to, and under or derived from all presently existing and future advance payment agreements, and oil, casinghead gas, and gas sales, exchange, and development contracts and agreements, including, without limitation, those contracts and agreements that are described on Exhibit "A," to the extent, and only to the extent, those contracts and agreements cover or include all or any portion of the Leases within the Contract Area; and
 
(3)           all of its rights, titles, and interests, whether now owned and existing or hereafter acquired or arising, in, to, and under or derived from all existing and future permits, licenses, rights-of-way, and similar rights and privileges that relate to or are appurtenant to any of the Leases within the Contract Area.
 
(e)           Recordation.  To provide evidence of, and to further perfect the Parties' security rights created hereunder, upon request, each Party shall execute and acknowledge the Memorandum of Operating Agreement and Financing Statement (Louisiana) attached as Exhibit "E" (the "Memorandum of Operating Agreement and Financing Statement (Louisiana)") in multiple counterparts as appropriate.  The Party requesting execution of the aforesaid document shall file the Memorandum of Operating Agreement and Financing Statement (Louisiana) in the public records set forth below at its sole cost and expense to serve as notice of the existence of this Agreement as a burden on the title of the Operator and the Non-operators to their interests in the Leases within the Contract Area and for purposes of satisfying otherwise relevant recording and filing requirements of applicable law and to attach an original of the Memorandum of Operating Agreement and Financing Statement (Louisiana) to a standard UCC-1 in mutually agreeable forms for filing in the UCC records set forth below to perfect the security interests created by the Parties in this Agreement.  Upon the acquisition of a leasehold interest in a Lease within the Contract Area, the Parties shall, within five business days following request by one of the Parties hereto, execute and furnish to the requesting Party for recordation such a Memorandum of Operating Agreement and Financing Statement (Louisiana) describing such leasehold interest.  Such Memorandum of Operating Agreement and Financing Statement (Louisiana) shall be amended from time to time upon acquisition of additional leasehold interests in the Leases within the Contract Area, and the Parties shall, within five business days following request by one of the Parties hereto, execute and furnish to the requesting Party for recordation any such amendment.
 
The Memorandum of Operating Agreement and Financing Statement (Louisiana) is to be filed or recorded, as the case may be, in (a) the conveyance records of the parish or parishes adjacent to the lands or offshore blocks covered by the Leases within the Contract Area or contained within the Leases within the Contract Area pursuant to La. R.S. 9:2731 et seq., (b) the mortgage records of such parish or parishes, and (c) the appropriate Uniform Commercial Code records.
 
8.6           Default.  If any Party does not pay its share of the charges authorized under this Agreement when due, the Operator may give the defaulting Party notice that unless payment is made within thirty (30) days from delivery of the notice, the non-paying Party shall be in default.  A Party in default shall have no further access to the rig, Platform or Facilities, any Confidential Information or other maps, records, data, interpretations, or other information obtained in connection with activities or operations hereunder or be allowed to participate in meetings.  A Party in default shall not be entitled to vote or to make an election until such time as the defaulting Party is no longer in default.  The voting interest of each non-defaulting Party shall be counted in the proportion its Participating Interest share bears to the total non-defaulting Participating Interest shares.  As to any operation approved during the time a Party is in default, such defaulting Party shall be deemed to be a Non-participating Party, except where such approval is binding on all Parties or Participating Parties, as applicable. In the event a Party believes that such statement of charges is incorrect, the Party shall nevertheless pay the amounts due as provided herein, and the Operator shall attempt to resolve the issue as soon as practicable, but said attempt shall be made no later than sixty (60) days after receiving notice from the Party of such disputed charges.
 
17
8.7           Unpaid Charges.  If any Participating Party fails to pay its share of the costs and other expenses authorized under this Agreement in accordance with Exhibit “C” or to otherwise perform any of its obligations under this Agreement when due, the Party to whom such payment is due, in order to take advantage of the provisions of Article 8.5, shall notify the other Party by certified or registered U.S. Mail that it is in default and has thirty (30) days from the receipt of such notice to pay.  If such payment is not made timely by the non-paying Party after the issuance of such notice to pay, the Party requesting such payment may take immediate steps to diligently pursue collection of the unpaid costs and other expenses owed by such Participating Party and to exercise the mortgage and security rights granted by this Agreement.  The bringing of a suit and the obtaining of a judgment by any Party for the secured indebtedness shall not be deemed an election of remedies or otherwise affect the security rights granted herein.  In addition to any other remedy afforded by law, each Party shall have, and is hereby given and vested with, the power and authority to foreclose the lien, mortgage, pledge, and security interest established hereby in its favor in the manner provided by law, to exercise all rights of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code as adopted by the state in which the Leases within the Contract Area are located or such other states as such Party may deem appropriate.  The Operator shall keep an accurate account of amounts owed by the nonperforming Party (plus interest and collection costs) and any amounts collected with respect to amounts owed by the nonperforming Party.  In the event there become three or more Parties to this Agreement, then if any nonperforming Party's share of costs remains delinquent for a period of sixty (60) days, each other Participating Party shall, upon the Operator's request, pay the unpaid amount of costs in the proportion that its Working Interest bears to the total non-defaulting Working Interests.  Each Participating Party paying its share of the unpaid amounts of a nonperforming Party shall be subrogated to the Operator's mortgage and security rights to the extent of the payment made by such Participating Party.
 
8.8           Carved-out Interests.  Except for the “Permitted Encumbrance” identified on Exhibit “A”, any agreements creating any overriding royalty, production payment, net proceeds interest, net profits interest, carried interest or any other interest carved out of a Working Interest in the Leases within the Contract Area shall specifically make such interests inferior to the rights of the Parties to this Agreement. If any Party whose Working Interest is so encumbered does not pay its share of costs and other expenses authorized under this Agreement, and the proceeds from the sale of its production of oil, gas and other minerals pursuant to Article 8.5 are insufficient to pay such costs and expenses, the security rights provided for in this Article 8.5 may be applied against the carved-out interests with which the defaulting or non-performing Party’s interest in the Leases within the Contract Area is burdened. In such event, the rights of the owner of such carved-out interest shall be subordinated to the security rights granted by Article 8.5.

All notices and responses thereto shall be in writing and delivered in person or by telephone followed by United States mail, telex, telegraph, telecopier (facsimile) or cable; however, if a drilling rig is on location and standby charges are accumulating, such notices and responses shall be given by telephone and immediately confirmed in writing.  Notices and responses shall be deemed given only when received by the Party to whom such notice or response is directed, except that any notice or response by certified United States mail or equivalent, telegraph, or cable properly addressed, pursuant to Section 6.1, and with all postage and charges prepaid shall be deemed given seventy-two (72) hours after such notice is deposited in the mail exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays, or twenty-four (24) hours after such notice or response is sent by telecopier (facsimile), receipt confirmed, or filed with an operating telegraph or cable company for immediate transmission exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays.
 
9.2           Content of Notice.  Any notice which requires a response shall indicate the response time specified in Section 9.3.  If a proposal involves a Platform, Facility or Subsequent Facility, the notice shall contain a description of same, including location and the estimated costs of design fabrication, transportation and installation.  If a proposal involves an Exploratory Operation or a Development Operation, the notice shall include the proposed depth, the objective zone or zones to be tested, the surface and bottom-hole locations, applicable details regarding directional drilling, the equipment to be used, and the estimated costs of the operation including all necessary expenditures through installation of the wellhead or abandonment of the well.
 
9.3           Response to Notices.  Each Party's response to a proposal shall be in writing to all other Parties.  Unless otherwise specified herein, response times shall be as follows:
 
9.3.1
Platform Construction.  When any proposal for well operations involves the construction of a Platform, each Party shall respond within sixty (60) days after receipt of notice.
 
 
 
19
 
9.3.2
Proposal Without Platform.  When any proposal for well operations does not require construction of a Platform, each Party shall respond within thirty (30) days after receipt of notice.  However, if a drilling rig is on location as a result of a joint Exploratory or Development Operation previously conducted thereon and standby charges are accumulating, the response shall be made within twenty-four (24) hours, inclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays, after receipt of notice.
9.3.3
Other Matters.  For all other matters requiring notice, each Party shall respond within thirty (30) days after receipt of notice.
 
9.4           Failure to Respond.  Failure of any Party to respond to a proposal or notice, to vote, or to elect to participate within the period required by this Agreement shall be deemed to be a negative response, vote, or election.
 
9.5           Restrictions on Multiple Well Proposals.  Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, it is specifically provided that no notice shall be given under this Article 9 hereof which simultaneously proposes the drilling of more than two (2) wells, or proposes the drilling of more than one (1) more well while there is an outstanding proposal.  Further, these provisions of this Article 9, insofar as they pertain to notification by a Party of its desire to drill a well, shall be suspended for so long as: (1) a prior notice has been given which is still in force and effect and the period of time during which the well regarding same may be commenced has not expired; or (2) a well is presently drilling hereunder.  This section shall not apply under those circumstances where the well to which notice is directed is a well which is required under the terms of a Lease or one required to maintain a portion thereof in force.  In the event drilling operations are necessary to perpetuate a Lease, any Party may propose and commence the drilling of such additional well(s) pursuant to the terms and conditions hereof no earlier than one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the date operations must be commenced, regardless of other proposals then under consideration or drilling operations then in progress.

ARTICLE 10
EXPLORATORY OPERATIONS

10.1           Operations by All Parties.  Any Party may propose an Exploratory Well by notifying the other Parties.  If all the Parties agree to participate in drilling the proposed well, Operator shall drill same at their cost and risk.  If a mobile drilling rig is not already on location as a result of a prior Exploratory or Development Operation and the proposal ("Original Proposal") has not already been approved, then any Party may submit an alternate well proposal for consideration within ten (10) days after receiving the Original Proposal to drill a well.  If one or more alternate proposals have been submitted in accordance with the foregoing, then the Operator shall call a meeting of the Parties to be held within seven (7) days following receipt of the alternate proposal(s), at which the Parties shall determine by majority vote in interest which proposal shall be considered by the Joint Account.  In the event that no proposal receives support of a majority in interest, then the proposal receiving the greatest support shall prevail.  In the event of a tie between two or more proposals, then the proposal (including the Original Proposal) supported by the largest number of Parties shall prevail.  Each Party having the right to participate in the proposal so selected shall make its election whether to join in the drilling of such well within fifteen (15) days after the meeting was held.  If drilling of such well is not commenced within one hundred twenty (120) days after the last applicable election date, the effect shall be the same as if the proposal had not been made; however, the one hundred twenty (120) day period shall automatically be extended for an additional period, not to exceed sixty (60) days, as may be necessary, in order to obtain all applicable required regulatory permits, so long as applications for such required permits were properly filed within thirty (30) days after the last applicable election date.  Drilling operations shall be deemed to have commenced on the date rig charges begin according to the terms of the drilling contract.
 
20
10.2           Second Opportunity to Participate.  If fewer than all but one (1) or more Parties having a combined Working Interest of twenty (20%) or more elect to participate, the Operator shall inform the Parties of the elections made, whereupon any Party originally electing not to participate may then elect to participate by notifying the Operator within forty-eight (48) hours, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays, after receipt of such information.  This provision shall apply only in the event that there are three (3) or more Parties to this Agreement.
 
 
10.3           Final Election to Participate.  If fewer than all but one (1) or more Parties having a combined Working Interest of twenty (20%) or more approve any proposed operation, the Operator, immediately after the expiration of the applicable response time, shall inform the Parties who have elected to participate of the total interest of the Parties approving such operation.  Each Participating Party, within forty-eight (48) hours (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays) after receipt of such notice, shall advise the Operator of its desire to (a) limit participation to such Party's working interest as shown on the proposed AFE; or (b) carry its proportionate part of Non-Participating Parties’ interests.  Failure to advise the proposing Party shall be deemed an election under (a), notwithstanding Section 9.4.  Should any Party elect to limit its participation to its interest as shown on the proposed AFE, the remaining Participating Parties shall carry the Non-Participating Parties' interests in such proportions as the remaining Participating Parties agree to by mutual consent.  In the event a drilling rig is on location, the time permitted for any response under this Article 10 shall not exceed a total of twenty-four (24) hours, inclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays.  This provision shall apply only in the event that there are three (3) or more Parties to this Agreement.
 
10.4           Operations by Fewer Than All Parties.  If fewer than all but one (1) or more Parties having a combined Working Interest of twenty percent (20%) or more elect to participate in and agree to bear all of the cost and risk of drilling the proposed well, Operator shall drill such well under this Agreement and the applicable provisions of Article 12 and the following special provisions shall apply:
 
 
(a)
If the well will be the first Exploratory Well drilled under this Agreement, then as of the last applicable election date, each Non-Participating Party shall be deemed to have relinquished to the Participating Parties, in proportion to their Participating Interests or in the proportions otherwise agreed by the Participating Parties, all of its interest in the Contract Area.  If such well is commenced within the time provided in Section 10.1 and is drilled as proposed in accordance with this Agreement, each Non-Participating Party shall execute an assignment of all of its interest in the Contract Area to the Participating Parties, in proportion to their Participating Interests or in the proportions otherwise agreed by the Participating Parties.
 
 
 
(b)
If the well will not be the first Exploratory Well drilled under this Agreement and if such well is commenced within the time provided in Section 10.1 and is drilled as proposed in accordance with this Agreement, then, all of the Non-Participating Party's(ies') operating rights and interests in production from such well shall be vested in the Participating Parties in proportion to their Participating Interest, whether or not any instrument evidencing a transfer of rights and interests has been delivered by the Non-Participating Party(ies).  The Participating Party(ies) shall have the right to recoup the costs applicable to such well as determined by Section 12.2 and/or Section 12.5 and the drilling of such well shall be governed by Article 12, except that the percentage of recoupment as provided in Section 12.2.1 (a) shall be eight hundred percent (800%) of the Non-Participating Party's Share of the cost of drilling the well.
 
 
21
If the well is not commenced within the time period provided in Section 10.1, the effect shall be as if the proposal had not been made.
 
10.5           Substitute Well.  If, prior to reaching the proposed depth or objective zone or zones to be tested for the Initial Exploratory Well or Exploratory Well as originally proposed, the Participating Party or Parties encounter mechanical difficulties, inpenetrable formation, and/or Gulf Coast conditions which render drilling impractical, then the Participating Party of Parties, or any of them, shall have the right, but not the obligation, to carry out the original proposed operation by drilling a Substitute Well.  Operations for the Substitute Well shall be commenced within sixty (60) days after the date the drilling operations cease on the well for which the Substitute Well is a substitute.  Operations for the Substitute Well shall be commenced as if it were the original proposed Initial Exploratory Well or Exploratory Well for which it is the substitute; and the relationship, rights and obligations as between the Participating Party and Non-Participating Party or Parties shall be the same as if the Substitute Well were, in fact, the proposed Initial Exploratory Well or Exploratory Well, as applicable.
 
22
10.6           Course of Action After Drilling to Initial Objective Depth.  At such time as an Exploratory Well has been drilled to the initial objective depth as proposed, or a mutually agreed upon lesser depth, and all approved logs, cores, and other tests have been completed, and the results thereof furnished to the Participating Parties, Operator shall notify the Participating Parties setting forth Operator's recommendation to either:
 
 
(a)
Conduct additional coring, testing, or logging of the formations encountered.  (If conflicting proposals are approved, the proposal receiving the largest percentage of Working Interest approval shall
 
take precedence.  In the event of a tie between two or more approved proposals, the approved proposal first received by the Parties shall take precedence.)
 
(b)
Run casing and temporarily abandon the well for future completion.  (This election is not applicable for a well drilled from a Platform.)
 
(c)
Attempt completion, with a deeper completion having priority over a shallower completion attempt.  (If conflicting proposals for a single completion and a dual completion are approved, the proposal receiving the largest Working Interest shall take precedence.  Provided however, if the proposal taking precedence is a dual completion, then the dual must either include the zone approved for the single completion or provide for the completion in zones all of which are deeper than the zone approved for the single completion.)
 
(d)
Deepen the well.  (If conflicting proposals are approved, the operation proposed to the deepest depth shall take precedence.)
 
(e)
Sidetrack the well to another bottom hole location not deeper than the stratigrephic equivalent of the initial objective depth.
 
(f)
Perform other operations on the well. (If conflicting proposals are approved, the proposal receiving the largest percentage of Working Interest approval shall take precedence.  In the event of a tie between two or more approved proposals, the approved proposal first received by the Parties shall take precedence.)
 
(g)
Plug and abandon the well.
 
The Participating Parties, within twenty-four (24) hours, inclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal Holidays, after receipt of Operator's recommendation, shall respond thereto by either approving it or making another proposal.  If another proposal is made, the Participating Parties shall have an additional twenty-four (24) hours, inclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays, to respond thereto.  If conflicting proposals are made, the priority of operations shall be given first to (a) above and next to (b) above and so forth.  Failure of a Participating Party to respond to a proposal shall be deemed a negative response.
 
 
23
 
10.6.1
Operation by All Parties.  Subject to Section 10.6.4, if all Participating Parties approve a proposal, Operator shall conduct the operation at the Participating Parties’ cost and risk.
 
10.6.2
Operations by Fewer than All Parties.  If one (1) or more Parties having a combined Participating Interest in the well of twenty percent (20%) or more approve a proposal and agree to bear the cost, risk and liabilities (including loss of the hole due to deepening of any well) thereof, except a proposal to plug and abandon, Operator shall conduct the same as a Non-Consent Operation for such Parties pursuant to the provisions of Article 12, except that the percentage of recoupment as provided in Section 12.2.1(a) shall be the same as provided for in Section 10.4(b).  If no proposal receives the required approval, the well shall be plugged and abandoned at the expense of all Participating Parties unless any Participating Party notifies Operator within twenty-four (24) hours, inclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays, after the end of the last applicable election period that it desires to immediately assume all costs and risks including liabilities of further operations, in which event Operator shall, as promptly as possible, commence the proposed operation pursuant to the provisions of Article 12.  In the event there is more than one (1) Participating Party, each of which is willing to assume all costs, risks and liabilities of further operations, but each desires to perform a different operation, then the order of priority as listed above herein shall prevail and govern.
 
 
10.6.3
Obligations and Liabilities of Participating Parties.  If the decision is to complete at initial objective depth, to plug back and complete at a lesser depth, to deepen or to Sidetrack to another bottomhole location, a Party, by becoming a Non-Participating Party, shall be relieved of the obligations and liabilities as to such operation, except as to its share of the costs of plugging and abandoning that portion of the well in which it was a Participating Party.
 
10.6.4
Deepening or Sidetracking of Non-Consent Exploratory Well.  Subject to the terms of Section 10.6 above, if drilling to the initial objective depth does not result in a well which will be qualified as a Producible Well and the decision is to drill deeper or Sidetrack, each Non-Participating Party shall be notified by the Operator of such decision.  Any Non-Participating Party may then agree to participate in a deepening or Sidetracking operation by notifying the Operator, within forty-eight (48) hours, inclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays, after receiving notice of the decision.  In such event any Non-Participating Party which elects to participate in deepening or Sidetracking the well as proposed shall immediately pay to the Participating Parties its Participating Interest share of the costs of the well as if it had originally participated to the initial objective depth or that point the Sidetracking operation is commenced if lesser than the initial objective depth.  Thereafter such Non-Participating Party shall be deemed for all purposes to be a Participating Party as to such deepening or Sidetracking operations, and the provisions of Section 10.4 shall not be applicable to such Party as to the deepened or Sidetracked portion of the well.  The initial Participating Parties, however, shall continue to be entitled to recoup out of the proceeds received from production from the non-consent portion of the Non-Consent Well any balance remaining pursuant to the terms specified in Section 10.4 applicable to such Non-Consent Well, less the amount paid by a Non-Participating Party pursuant to this Section 10.6.4.
 
 
 
 
 
24
 
10.6.5
Plugging and Abandoning Cost.  The Participating Parties shall pay all costs of plugging and abandoning except any costs associated with a subsequent Non-Consent Operation.  The participants in a subsequent Non-Consent Operation shall pay any plugging and abandoning costs associated with such operation.  A Non-Consent Operation does not include the abandonment of the original wellbore above the depth at which the Non-Consent Operation commenced.

ARTICLE 11
DEVELOPMENT OPERATIONS

11.1           Operations by All Parties.  Any Party may propose Development Operations, including any wells (whether drilling, completing, recompleting, deepening, deviating or Sidetracking, plugging back or working over), Platform,  Facilities and/or Subsequent Facilities required by such operations, by submitting a Development Operation AFE to the other Parties for approval pursuant to the response to notice procedures set forth in Article 9.  If all Parties elect to participate in the proposed operation, Operator shall conduct such operation at their cost and risk.
 
 
11.2           Second Opportunity to Participate.  If fewer than all but one (1) or more Parties having a combined Working Interest of twenty percent (20%) or more elect to participate, the Operator shall inform the Parties of the elections made, whereupon any Party originally electing not to participate may then elect to participate by notifying the Operator within forty-eight (48) hours, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays.  This provision shall apply only in the event that there are three (3) or more Parties to this Agreement.
 
11.3           Final Election to Participate.  If fewer than all but one (1) or more Parties having a combined Working Interest of twenty percent (20%) or more approve any proposed operation, the Operator, immediately after the expiration of the applicable response time, shall inform the Parties who have elected to participate of the total interest of the Parties approving such operation.  Each Participating Party, within forty-eight (48) hours, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays, after receipt of such notice, shall advise the Operator of its desire to: (a) limit participation to such Party's interest as shown on the proposed AFE; or (b) carry its proportionate part of Non-Participating Parties interests.  Failure to advise the proposing Party shall be deemed an election under (a), notwithstanding Section 9.4.  Should any Party elect to limit its participation to its interest as shown on the proposed AFE, the remaining Participating Parties shall carry the Non-Participating Parties interest in such proportions as the remaining Participating Parties agree to by mutual consent.  In the event a drilling rig is on location, the time permitted for any response under this Article 11 shall not exceed a total of twenty-four (24) hours, inclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays.  This provision shall apply only in the event that there are three (3) or more Parties to this Agreement.
 
25
11.4           Operations by Fewer Than All Parties.  If fewer than all but one (1) or more Parties having a combined Working Interest of twenty percent (20%) or more elect to participate in and agree to bear all of the cost, risk and liability of a Development Operation, Operator shall conduct such operation pursuant to Article 12.
 
11.5           Timely Operations.  Development Operations shall be commenced within one hundred twenty (120) days following the date upon which the last applicable election may be made; however, the one hundred twenty (120) day period shall automatically be extended for an additional period, not to exceed sixty (60) days, as may be necessary, in order to obtain all applicable required regulatory permits so long as applications for such required permits were properly filed within thirty (30) days after the last applicable election date.  If no operations are commenced within such time period, the effect shall be as if the proposal had not been made.  Operations shall be deemed to have commenced: (a) on the date the contract for a new Platform is let, if the notice indicated a need for such Platform, or (b) on the date the rig charges begin according to the terms of the drilling contract.  For all other Development Operations, Development Operations shall be deemed to have commenced on the day charges are incurred pursuant to an approved AFE.
 
11.6           Substitute Well.  If, prior to reaching the proposed depth or objective zone or zones to be tested for the Development Operation as originally proposed, the Participating Party or Parties encounter mechanical difficulties, inpenetrable formation, and/or Gulf Coast conditions which render further drilling impossible, then the Participating Party of Parties, or any of them, shall have the right, but not the obligation, to carry out the original proposed operation by drilling a Substitute Well.  Operations for the Substitute Well shall be commenced within sixty (60) days after the date the drilling operations cease on the well for which the Substitute Well is a substitute.  Operations for the Substitute Well shall be commenced were the original proposed Development Operation for which it is the substitute, and the relationship, rights and obligations as between the Participating Party and Non-Participating Party or Parties shall be the same as if the Substitute Well were, in fact, the proposed Development Operation, as applicable.
 
26
11.7           Course of Action After Drilling to Initial Objective Depth.  At such time as a Development Well has been drilled to the initial objective depth as proposed and all approved logs, cores and other tests have been completed and the results thereof furnished to the Participating Parties, Operator shall notify the Participating Parties setting forth Operator's recommendation to either:
 
 
(a)
Conduct additional coring, testing, or logging of the formations encountered.  (If conflicting proposals are approved, the proposal receiving the largest percentage of Working Interest approval shall take precedence.  In the event of a tie between two or more approved proposals, the approved proposal first received by the Parties shall take precedence.)
 
(b)
Run casing and temporarily abandon the well for future completion.  (This election is not applicable for a well drilled from a Platform.)
 
(c)
Attempt completion, with a deeper completion having priority over a shallower completion attempt.  (If conflicting proposals for a single completion and a dual completion are approved, the proposal receiving the largest Working Interest shall take precedence.  Provided however, if the proposal taking precedence is a dual completion, then the dual must either include the zone approved for the single completion or provide for the completion in zones all of which are deeper than the zone approved for the single completion.)
 
(d)
Deepen the well.  (If conflicting proposals are approved, the operation proposed to the deepest depth shall take precedence.)
 
(e)
Sidetrack the well to another bottom hole location not deeper than the stratigraphic equivalent of the initial objective depth;
 
(f)
Perform other operations on the well.  (If conflicting proposals are approved, the proposal receiving the largest percentage of Working Interest approval shall take precedence.  In the event of a tie between two or more approved proposals, the approved proposal first received by the Parties shall take precedence.)
 
(g)
Plug and abandon the well.
 
The Participating Parties, within forty-eight (48) hours, inclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays, after receipt of Operator's recommendation, shall respond thereto by either approving it or making another proposal.  If another proposal is made, the Participating Parties shall have an additional twenty-four (24) hours to respond thereto.  If conflicting proposals are made, the priority of operations shall be given first to (a) above and next to (b) above and so forth.  Failure of a Participating Party to respond to a proposal shall be deemed a negative response.
 
27
11.7.1       Operations by All Parties.  If all Participating Parties approve a proposal, Operator shall conduct the operation at the Participating Parties' cost and risk.
 
11.7.2       Operations by Fewer than All Parties.  If fewer than all but one (1) or more Parties having a combined Participating Interest in the well of twenty percent (20%) or more approve a proposal and agree to bear the cost, risk, and liabilities (including loss of the hole due to deepening of any well) thereof, except a proposal to plug and abandon, Operator shall conduct the same as a Non-Consent Operation for such Parties pursuant to the provisions of Article 12.  If no proposal receives the required approval, the well shall be plugged and abandoned at the expense of all Participating Parties unless any Participating Party notifies Operator within twenty-four (24) hours after the end of the last applicable election period that it desires to immediately assume all costs and risks including liabilities of further operations, in which event Operator shall, as promptly as possible, commence the proposed operation pursuant to the provisions of Article 12.  In the event there is more than one (1) Party, each of which is willing to assume all costs, risks and liabilities of further operations, but each desires to perform a different operation, then the order of priority as listed above herein shall prevail and govern.
 
11.7.3       Obligations and Liabilities of Participating Parties.  If the decision is to complete at initial objective depth, to plug back and complete at a lesser depth, to deepen or to Sidetrack to another bottomhole location, a Party, by becoming a Non-Participating Party, shall be relieved of the obligations and liabilities as to such operation, except as to its share of the costs of plugging and abandoning that portion of the well in which it was a Participating Party.
 
11.8           Deeper Drilling.  If a well is proposed to be drilled below the deepest Producible Reservoir penetrated by a Producible Well, any Party may elect to participate either in the well as proposed or to the base of the deepest Producible Reservoir.  A Party electing to participate in such well to the base of said Producible Reservoir shall bear its proportionate part of the cost and risk of drilling to said Producible Reservoir including completion or abandonment. All operations below the depth to which such Party agreed to participate shall be governed by Article 12.  However, if the proposal to drill below the deepest Producible Reservoir penetrated by a Producible Well meets the requirements of an Exploratory Operation, the percentage of recoupment shall be that specified in Section 10.4(b) and shall be subject to the provisions of Article 10 with respect to such operations.
 
11.9           Plugging and Abandoning Cost.  The Participating Parties shall pay all costs of plugging and abandoning except any costs associated with a subsequent Non-Consent Operation.  The participants in a subsequent Non-Consent Operation shall pay any plugging and abandoning costs associated with such operation.  A Non-Consent Operation does not include the abandonment of the original wellbore above the depth at which the Non-Consent Operation commenced.
 
28
11.10          Subsequent Facilities.  The affirmative vote of one (1) or more Parties having a combined Participating Interest of fifty-one percent (51%) or more in the wells to be served by the proposed Subsequent Facilities shall constitute approval for the construction of such Subsequent Facilities and all Parties having an interest in the wells to be served shall be bound by such approval and be required to participate in the costs therefor.  Nothing hereunder shall limit a Party's rights under Section 21.1 to incur additional costs for separate facilities.
 
11.11          Contracts.  Operator may enter into contracts with independent contractors for Development Operations and shall utilize competitive bidding.
 
ARTICLE 12
NON-CONSENT OPERATIONS

12.1           Non-Consent Operations.  Operator shall conduct Non-Consent Operations at the sole risk, expense, and liability of the Participating Parties, in accordance with the following provisions:
 
12.1.1
Non-Interference.  Non-Consent Operations shall not interfere unreasonably with any other operations being conducted within the Contract Area.
 
12.1.2
Multiple Completion Limitation.  Non-Consent Operations shall not be conducted in a well having multiple completions unless: (a) each completion is owned by the same Parties participating in the Non-Consent Operations and in the same proportions; (b) the well is incapable of producing from any of its completions; or (c) all Participating Parties in the well consent to such operations.
 
12.1.3
Metering.  In Non-Consent Operations, production need not be separately metered, but subject to approval by appropriate governmental authority, may be determined on the basis of well tests.
 
12.1.4
Non-Consent Well.  Operations on a Non-Consent Well shall not be conducted in any Producible Reservoir penetrated by a Producible Well without written approval of each Non-Participating Party unless these four (4) conditions are satisfied: (a) such Producible Reservoir shall have been designated in the notice as an objective zone; (b) completion of such well in said Producible Reservoir will not increase the well density governmentally prescribed or approved for such Producible Reservoir; (c) the horizontal distance between the vertical projections of the midpoint of the Producible Reservoir in such well and any existing well in the same Producible Reservoir will be at least one thousand (1,000) feet if an oil-well completion or two thousand (2,000) feet if a gas-well completion; and (d) completion of such well as a producer will not cause or result in a decreased "MER" or "MPR" for any existing Producible Reservoir or Producible Well.  The terms "MER" and "MPR" are defined under 30 Code of Federal Regulations, Subpart K-Production rates, Parts 250.170 through 250.177.
 
 
 
 
29
 
 
12.1.5
Cost Information.  Operator shall, within one hundred twenty (120) days after completion of a Non-Consent Well, furnish the Parties an inventory and either a joint interest billing or an itemized statement of the cost of such well and equipment pertaining thereto.  Operator shall furnish to the Parties a quarterly statement showing operating expenses and the proceeds from the sale of production from the well for the preceding three (3) month period.  When Operator’s payout calculation indicates that payout has occurred, Operator shall promptly notify all Parties.
 
12.1.6
Completion.  For the purposes of determinations hereunder, each completion shall be considered a separate well.
 
 
12.2        Forfeiture of Interest.  Upon commencement of Non-Consent Operations, each Non-Participating Party's leasehold operating rights in the Non-Consent Operation and title to production therefrom shall be owned by and vested in each Participating Party in proportion to its Participating Interest or in proportions agreed to by the Participating Parties for as long as the operations originally proposed are being conducted or production is obtained, subject to the following:
 
12.2.1
Production Reversion.  Such leasehold operating rights and title to production shall revert to each Non-Participating Party at 7:00 a.m. on the day following the date when the Participating Parties have recouped out of the Non-Participating Party's Share of the proceeds of production from such Non-Consent Operations an amount, which when added to any amounts received under Section 12.3, equals the sum of the following:
 
 
(a)
Six hundred percent (600%) of the Non-Participating Party's Share of the cost of drilling, testing, completing, recompleting, working over, deepening, deviating or Sidetracking, plugging back, or temporarily plugging and abandoning each Non-Consent Well (or any Non-Consent Operation(s) in a joint well), and equipping it through the wellhead connections, reduced by any contribution received under Article 20; plus
 
(b)
Three hundred percent (300%) of the Non-Participating Party's Share of the cost of any Non-Consent Facilities necessary to establish the production resulting from the operations defined in Section 12.2.1.(a) above; plus

Three hundred percent (300%) of the Non-Participating Party's Share of the cost of any Platform in which it does not participate and which must be installed to establish the production resulting from the operations defined in Section 12.2.1.(a) above; plus,
 
(d)
Three hundred percent (300%) of the Non-Participating Party's Share of the cost of using any existing Platform, whether or not owned by the Joint Account; plus,
 
(e)
Three hundred percent (300%) of the Non-Participating Party's Share of the cost of using any existing Facilities not owned by the Joint Account, including leased facilities; plus
 
(f)
One hundred percent (100%) of the Non-Participating Party's Share of gathering, treating, and operating expenses, royalties, and severance, production, and other similar taxes.
 
At 7:00 a.m. upon the day following the date of recoupment of such costs, a Non-Participating Party shall become a Participating Party in such operations.
 
 
30
 
12.2.2
Non-Production Reversion.  If such Non-Consent Operations fail to obtain production or if such operations result in production which ceases prior to recoupment by the Participating Parties of the penalties provided for above, such operating rights shall revert to each Non-Participating Party except that all wells (or portions thereof associated with any Non-Consent Operation(s) in a joint well), Platforms and Facilities of the Non-Consent Operations, as well as all liabilities and benefits related thereto, shall remain vested in the Participating Parties; however, any salvage in excess of the sum remaining under Section 12.2.1 shall be credited to all Parties.
 
 
12.3           Deepening or Sidetracking of Non-Consent Development Well.  If any Participating Party proposes to deepen or Sidetrack a Non-Consent Development Well, a Non-Participating Party may participate by notifying the Operator within thirty (30) days after receiving the proposal (forty-eight (48) hours, inclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays, if a rig is on location) that it will join in the deepening or Sidetracking operation and by paying to the Participating Parties; 1) if it is a deepening an amount equal to the costs of the well as if such Non-Participating Party had originally participated to the objective depth or; 2) if it is a sidetrack operation an amount equal to the Non-Participating Parties share of drilling the non-consent well to that point the Sidetracking operation is commenced.  The Participating Parties shall continue to be entitled to recoup the full sum specified in Section 12.2.1 applicable to the non-consent portion of the well out of the proceeds received from production from the non-consent portion of the well, less any amount received under this Section 12.3.
 
 
12.4           Operations from Non-Consent Platforms and Facilities.  Subject to the following, a Party which did not originally participate in a Platform or Facilities shall be a Non-Participating Party as to ownership therein and all operations thereon until the Participating Parties as to such Platform or Facilities have recouped the full sum specified in Section 12.2.1 applicable to such non-consent Platform or Facilities and the Non-Consent Operations which resulted in the setting of such Platform or Facilities and other Non-Consent Operations thereon or therefrom.  However, any original Non-Participating Party may participate in additional operations from such Platform or Facilities by notifying the Operator within thirty (30) days after receiving a proposal for operations from such Platform or Facilities that it will join in such proposed operations by paying to the Participating Parties in such Platform or Facilities an amount equal to the non-consent penalty provided for in Section 12.2.1 applicable to such Non-Participating Party’s Share of the actual cost of such Platform or Facilities, less any recoupment therefor previously obtained.  Thereafter, such original Non-Participating Party in such non-consent Platform or Facilities shall own its proportionate share thereof.  The Participating Parties in such non-consent Platform or Facilities shall continue to be entitled to recoup the full sum specified in Section 12.2.1 applicable to any other Non-Consent Operations thereon or therefrom.
 
31
12.5           Discovery or Extension from Mobile Drilling Operations.  If a Non-Consent Well is drilled from a mobile drilling rig or floating drilling vessel and results in the discovery of oil or gas or extension of a Producible Reservoir and, if within one (1) year from the date the drilling equipment is released, a Platform or other fixed structure is ordered and if its location is within three thousand (3,000) feet from the vertical projection of the bottom-hole location of any such well (unless limited by surface restrictions or seabed conditions), the recoupment of costs applicable to such well shall be governed by Section 12.2 and shall be recovered by the Participating Parties in the following manner:
 
 
(a)
If such Non-Consent Well is not completed and produced, recoupment shall be out of one-half (1/2) of the Non-Participating Party's Share of production from all subsequently completed wells on the Contract Area which are completed in the Producible Reservoir discovered or extended by such Non-Consent Well and in which the Non-Participating Party in such Non-Consent Well has a Participating Interest.
 
(b)
If such Non-Consent Well is completed and produced, recoupment shall be out of the Non-Participating Party's Share of all production from such Non-Consent Well and one-half (1/2) of the Non-Participating Party's Share of production from all subsequently completed wells on the Contract Area which are completed in the Producible Reservoir discovered or extended by such Non-Consent Well and in which the Non-Participating Party in such Non-Consent Well has a Participating Interest.
 
12.6           Non-Consent Operations to Maintain Lease.  Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if a Lease has no wells thereon capable of commercial production in the final six (6) months of the primary term of such Lease and such Lease is not held by a unit or a Suspension of Production pursuant to other operations on the Lease or in the unit, any Party electing not to participate in the drilling of a well or other operation in the final six (6) months of the primary term or at any time during the secondary term, shall assign its full interest in such Lease pro-rata to the Parties hereto undertaking the drilling of such well or participating in such operation.  Such assignment shall be executed and delivered within thirty (30) days after commencement of the well or operation.  If at any time after the expiration of the primary term of a Lease, a well must be drilled or an operation conducted because of cessation of production or to fulfill an obligation to develop such Lease, such well or operation being required to extend the term of such Lease or a portion thereof, any Party electing not to participate in the operation or the drilling of such a well shall assign its full interest in that Lease, or portion thereof, pro-rata to the Parties hereto undertaking the drilling of such a well.  Such assignment shall be executed and delivered within thirty (30) days after commencement of the well or operation, but shall be limited to the portion of the Lease the term of which was extended by the operation or drilling the well, and provided any Non-Participating Party shall retain its rights and liabilities with respect to any previously completed wells on that Lease and the production therefrom.  Thereafter, that Lease shall no longer be a part of the Contract Area, and the Non-Participating Party or Parties shall no longer own an interest in any wells drilled on such Lease, other than those wells drilled prior to the occurrence set out herein.  Should the Parties electing to undertake the drilling of a well or conduct operations under this Section 12.6 fail to perform, as Participating Parties, the drilling of the well or operations substantially as proposed, the Parties receiving the aforementioned assignment shall assign back to the Party or Parties originally electing not to participate, that interest which was caused to be assigned pursuant to this Section 12.6.  A Party hereunder executing an assignment of its interest in a Lease pursuant to the foregoing shall not be relieved of any obligation hereunder accruing prior to such assignment.  If more than one (1) well is drilled or more than one (1) operation conducted, any of which would maintain or extend such Lease or such portions thereof, an assignment shall not be required from any Party participating in any such well(s) or operation(s) as to that portion of the Lease or unit which would have been maintained by such well(s) or operation(s).
 
32
12.7           Allocation of Platform Costs to Non-Consent Operations.  Non-Consent Operations shall be subject to further conditions as follows:
 
 
12.7.1
Charges.  If a Non-Consent Well is drilled from a Platform, the Participating Parties in such well shall be liable to the Joint Account owners of the Platform for the use of the Platform and its Facilities as follows:
 
 
(a)
Such Participating Parties shall pay a sum equal to that portion of the total cost of the Platform which one (1) Platform slot bears to the total number of slots on the Platform.  If the Non-Consent Well is abandoned, the right of Participating Parties to use that Platform slot shall terminate, unless such Parties commence drilling a substitute well from the same slot within ninety (90) days after abandonment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Non-Consent Well is abandoned as an unsuccessful well, and no substitute well is drilled by the Participating Parties, then, if the slot is abandoned in a condition such that it could be used for the drilling of a future well, the Participating Parties shall not be required to pay the sum set out in this Section 12.7.1.
 
(b)
If the Non-Consent Well production is handled through the Facilities, the Participating Parties shall pay a sum equal to that portion of the total cost of such Facilities, less accumulated depreciation, which one (1) well completion bears to the total number of Producible Well completions utilizing the Facilities.
 
 
 
 
33
 
 
12.7.2
Operating and Maintenance Charges.  The Participating Parties shall pay on a monthly basis all costs necessary to connect a Non-Consent Well to the Facilities and that proportionate part of the expense of operating and maintaining the Platform and Facilities applicable to the Non-Consent Well.  Platform and Facilities operating and maintenance expenses shall be allocated in proportion to the producing well count during a calendar month as it relates to the total number of wells producing from such Platform during such calendar month.  For the purpose of this provision, a producing zone or each completion in a multi-completed well shall be considered as a separate well.

12.7.3
Payments.  Payment of sums pursuant to Section 12.7.1 is not a purchase of an additional interest in the Platform or Facilities.  Such payments, if the recoupment provisions of Section 12.2 are applicable, shall be included in the total amount which the Participating Parties are entitled to recoup out of production from the Non-Consent Well.
 
12.8           Allocation of Costs Between Depths (Single Completion).  For the purpose of allocating costs on any well with a single completion in which the Participating Interests of the Parties are not the same for the entire depth or the completion thereof, the cost of drilling, completing, equipping, and plugging and abandoning such well shall be allocated on the following basis:
 
 
(a)
Intangible drilling, completion, casing string, and material costs from the surface to a depth one hundred feet (100') below the base of the Producible Reservoir in which the well is completed shall be charged to the Participating Parties in such completion in accordance with their respective Participating Interest.
 
(b)
Intangible drilling, completion, casing string, and material costs, other than tubing costs, from a depth of one hundred feet (100') below the base of the Producible Reservoir in which the well is completed to total depth shall be charged to the Participating Parties in the well to total depth in accordance with their respective Participating Interest.
 
(c)
All plugging and abandonment costs directly associated with the Producible Reservoir in which the well is completed will be allocated to the Participating Parties in that completion in accordance with their respective Participating Interests.  All final plugging and abandonment costs associated with the wellbore will be allocated proportionately among all Participating Parties in the well.
 
 
 
 
 
34
 
12.9           Allocation of Costs Between Depths (Multiple Completions).  For the purpose of allocating costs on any well completed in dual or multiple Producible Reservoirs in which the Participating Interests of the Parties are not the same for the entire depth or the completion thereof, the cost of drilling, completing, equipping, and plugging and abandoning such well shall be allocated on the following basis:
 
 
(a)
Intangible drilling, completion, casing string, and material costs other than tubing costs, from the surface to a depth one hundred feet (100') below the base of the upper completed Producible Reservoir shall be divided equally between the completed Producible Reservoirs and charged to the Participating Parties in
 
each Producible Reservoir in accordance with their respective Participating Interest.
 
(b)
Intangible drilling, completion, casing string, and material costs, other than tubing, from a depth one hundred feet (100') below the base of the upper completed Producible Reservoir to a depth one hundred feet (100') below the base of the second completed Producible Reservoir shall be divided equally between the second and any other Producible Reservoir completed below such depth and charged to the Participating Parties in each such Producible Reservoir in accordance with their respective Participating Interest.  If the well is completed in additional Producible Reservoirs, the costs applicable to each such Producible Reservoir shall be determined and charged to the Participating Parties in the same manner as prescribed for wells completed in dual Producible Reservoirs.
 
(c)
Intangible drilling, completion, casing string, and material costs, other than tubing costs, from a depth one hundred feet (100') below the base of the lowest completed Producible Reservoir to total depth shall be charged to the Participating Parties in the well to total depth in accordance with their respective Participating Interest.
 
(d)
Costs of tubing strings serving each separate Producible Reservoir shall be charged to the Participating Parties in each Producible Reservoir in accordance with their respective Participating Interest.
 
(e)
For the purposes of allocating tangible and intangible costs between Producible Reservoirs that occur at less than one hundred feet (100') intervals, the distance between the base of the upper reservoir to the top of the next lower reservoir shall be allocated equally between reservoirs.
 
(f)
All plugging and abandonment costs directly associated with a Producible Reservoir will be allocated to the Participating Parties in that reservoir in accordance with their respective Participating Interests.  All final plugging and abandonment costs associated with the wellbore will be allocated proportionately among all Participating Parties in the well.
 
 
 
 
 
35
 
12.10                      Allocation of Costs Between Depths (Dry Hole).  For the purpose of this Section, a dry hole shall mean a well drilled to an objective depth in which the Participating Parties elected not to complete, or if completed, the well was not a Producible Well and did not establish a Producible Reservoir.  In allocating costs on any well containing a dry hole, and in which the Participating Interests of the Parties are not the same for the entire depth or the completion thereof, the cost of drilling and plugging and abandoning such well shall be allocated on the following basis:
 
 
(a)
Costs to drill and plug and abandon a well proposed for completion in single, dual, or multiple objective depths shall be charged to the Participating Parties in the same manner as if the well had established a Producible Reservoir at each objective depth.
 
(b)
Additional plugging and abandoning costs related to any deepening, completion attempt, or other operation shall be at the sole risk and expense of the Participating Parties in such operation.
 
12.11                      Intangible Drilling and Completion Cost Allocations.  For the purposes of allocating costs under Sections 12.8, 12.9, and 12.10, intangible drilling and completion costs, including non controllable materials costs, shall be allocated between Producible Reservoirs, including dry holes as defined in Section 12.10, and including the interval from one hundred feet (100') below the deepest Producible Reservoir to total depth on a drilling day ratio basis where the factor for each reservoir is determined by a fraction for which the numerator is the number of drilling and completion days applicable to that reservoir and the denominator is the total number of days spent on the well, beginning on the day the rig arrives on location and terminating when the rig is released.
 
 
12.12                      Subsequent Operations in Non-Consent Well.  Except as provided in Section 10.6.4 or 12.3, as applicable, an election not to participate in the drilling, Sidetracking, or deepening of a well shall be deemed to be an election not to participate in any subsequent operations in the well before full recovery by the Participating Parties of the Non-Participating Party's recoupment amount.  A subsequent operation conducted during the recoupment period by the Parties entitled to participate shall be subject to the recoupment provided in Section 12.2.1.

ARTICLE 13
ABANDONMENT AND SALVAGE

13.1           Platform Salvage and Removal Costs.  When the Parties owning a Platform mutually agree to dispose of such Platform, it shall be disposed of by the Operator as approved by such Parties with such Parties having a preferential right to acquire the Platform.  The costs, risks, and net proceeds, if any, resulting from such disposition shall be shared by such Parties in proportion to their ownership of the Platform.
 
13.2           Abandonment of Producing Well.  Any Participating Party may propose the abandonment of a well by notifying the other Participating Parties.  No well shall be abandoned without the unanimous approval of the Participating Parties.  The Participating Parties not consenting to the abandonment shall pay to each Participating Party desiring to abandon such abandoning Party's share of the current value of the well's salvageable material and equipment as determined pursuant to Exhibit "C", less the estimated current
costs of salvaging same and of plugging and abandoning the well as determined by the Participating Parties.  In the event such abandoning Party's interest in such salvage value is less than such Party's share of the estimated costs of salvaging materials, plugging and abandoning, the abandoning Party shall pay the Operator, for the benefit of the non-abandoning Parties, a sum equal to the deficiency.
 
13.3           Assignment of Interest.  Each Participating Party desiring to abandon a well pursuant to Section 13.2 shall assign effective as of the last applicable election date, to the non-abandoning Parties, in proportion to their Participating Interests, its interest in such well and the equipment therein and its ownership in the production from such well.  Any Party so assigning shall be relieved, after delivering the assignment, from any further liability with respect to said well, and each non-abandoning Party shall assume and bear all such liabilities in proportion to the share of interest that it receives from the abandoning Parties.  Notwithstanding Section 13.2, no Party shall be required to accept an assignment of an interest of a Party desiring to abandon a well.  If no Party is willing to accept the assignment, the Party seeking to abandon the well shall remain an owner in the well.
 
13.4           Abandonment Operations Required by Governmental Authority.  Any well abandonment or Platform removal required by a governmental authority shall be accomplished by Operator with the costs, risks, and net proceeds, if any, to be shared by the Parties owning such well or Platform in proportion to their Participating Interests.

ARTICLE 14
WITHDRAWAL

14.1           Withdrawal.  A Party may withdraw from this Agreement by assigning to the other Parties who do not desire to withdraw, all of its interest in the Contract Area and the wells, Platforms and Facilities used in operations thereon; provided that such assignment shall not relieve such Party from any obligation or liability incurred prior to the first day of the month following receipt of the assignment by assignees.  The assigned interest shall be owned by the assignees in proportion to their respective Participating Interests.  The assignees, in proportion to the respective interests so acquired, shall pay the assignor for its interest in the wells, Platforms and Facilities, the current salvage value thereof less its share of the estimated current cost of salvaging same, plugging and abandoning of wells, and removal of all Platforms and Facilities, as determined by the Parties.  In the event such withdrawing Party's interest in such salvage value is less than such Party's share of the estimated costs, the withdrawing Party shall pay the Operator, for benefit of the non-withdrawing Parties, a sum equal to the deficiency.  Within ninety (90) days after receiving notice of the assignment, Operator shall render a final statement to the withdrawing Party for its share of all expenses incurred through the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the assignment, plus any deficiency in salvage value.  Providing all such expenses, including any deficiency hereunder due from the withdrawing Party have been paid within thirty (30) days after the rendering of such final statement, the assignment shall be effective the first day of the month following its receipt, and the withdrawing Party shall thereafter be relieved from all further obligations and liabilities with respect to the Contract Area; provided, however, that such withdrawing Party shall remain liable for any costs, expenses, or damages theretofore accrued or arising out of any event accruing prior to such Party's withdrawal.
 
37
14.2           Limitations on Withdrawal.  No Party shall be relieved of its obligations hereunder during a blowout, a fire, or other emergency, but may withdraw from this Agreement after termination of such emergency, provided such Party shall remain liable for its share of all costs arising from said emergency.  Notwithstanding Section 14.1, no Party shall be required to accept an assignment of a withdrawing Party's interest.  If no Party is willing to accept the assignment, the Party seeking to withdraw shall remain subject to this Agreement.

ARTICLE 25
SUCCESSORS, ASSIGNS AND PREFERENTIAL RIGHTS

25.1           Successors and Assigns. This Agreement binds and inures to the benefit of the Parties and their respective heirs, successors, and assigns and shall constitute a covenant running with the Leases within the Contract Area. Each Party shall incorporate in each assignment of an interest in a Lease a provision that the assignment is subject to this Agreement.
 
 
 
 
25.2           Transfer of Interest. No transfer, assignment, or other disposition of interest by a Party shall relieve the Party of liabilities and obligations it has incurred or that are attributable to the interest transferred before the date of the transfer, and the obligation to pay and bear all costs and risks attributable to an operation in which the Party was a Participating Party before making the transfer, and the lien and security rights granted by Section 8.5 (Security Rights) shall continue to burden the interest transferred to secure payment of the obligations. The transferor shall be liable for all costs, expenses, and liabilities for well plugging and abandonment, Platform and Facilities removal and disposal, and site clearance for property and equipment attributable to the assigned interest before the date of the transfer, net of salvage proceeds.
 
25.3           Consent to Assign. A Party may not sell, transfer, farm out, assign, or otherwise dispose of all or part of its interest in a Lease without the prior written consent of the other Parties, unless:
 
 
(a)
the transferee is financially capable of assuming the obligations hereunder and, in accordance with Subsection 25.3(c), the transferor furnishes the Parties with proof of such financial capability that, in the case of Outer Continental Shelf leases, shall be proof that the transferee is currently qualified by the Minerals Management Service, an agency of the United States Department of the Interior, or a successor agency having jurisdiction (hereinafter “MMS”), to own Outer Continental Shelf leases and that the transferee has on file with the MMS the appropriate lessee and Operator bonds;
 
(b)
the transferee agrees in writing to assume all obligations and liabilities under this Agreement related to the interest acquired; and
 
(c)
the transferor has given the other Parties written notice of the transfer at least fifteen (15) days before the date of the transfer, such notice to include the name of each proposed transferee, a description of the interests to be transferred, and the proof set forth in Subsection 25.3(a).
 
The requirements of this Section 25.3 shall not apply to a merger, consolidation, reorganization, sale or transfer to an Affiliate, a mortgage by a Party of its interest in the Leases within the Contract Area, a sale of all, or substantially all, of a Party’s domestic exploration and production properties, or a transfer or disposition between the Parties hereto.
 
 
 
 
45
 
 
 
25.4           Transfers Between Parties. A transfer, relinquishment, or other disposition of interests in the Leases between Parties under Section 12.6 (Non-Consent Operations to Maintain Lease); Article 14 (Withdrawal); or Section 15.3 (Non-participation in Payments) shall be made without warranty of title. Any such transfer between the Parties, if applicable, shall be free and clear of all overriding royalty, production payment, net profits interest, mortgage, lien, security interest, or other burden or encumbrance, other than lessor’s royalty burdens and the Permitted Encumbrance shown on Exhibit “A”.
 
25.5           Division of Interest. If, at any time, the interest of a Party is divided among and owned by four (4) or more co-owners, Operator, at its discretion, may require the co-owners to appoint a single trustee or agent with full authority to receive notices, approve expenditures, receive billings for, and approve and pay the Party’s share of the joint expenses, and to deal generally with, and with power to bind the co-owners of the Party’s interest within the scope of the operations embraced in this Agreement. All such co-owners may separately dispose of their respective shares of the oil, gas, and condensate produced from the Contract Area and may receive, separately, payment of the sale proceeds thereof.
 
25.6           Preferential Rights. If a Party desires to transfer, sell, farmout, assign, or otherwise dispose of all or part of its Working Interest (“Disposing Party”), it shall promptly give written notice to the other Parties with full information about the proposed transaction, including, but not limited to, the name and address of the prospective transferee (who must be ready, willing, and able to acquire the interest and deliver the stated consideration therefor), the consideration for the transfer, farmout terms, and all other terms of the offer. In the case of a package sale of oil and gas interests that includes all or part of the Disposing Party’s Working Interest, or if the proposed transaction is structured as a non-simultaneous, like-kind exchange under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“Code”), the Working Interest that is subject to this preferential right shall be separately valued and the notice shall state the value attributed to the interest by the prospective transferee. The other Parties shall then have an optional prior right, for a period of thirty (30) days after receipt of the notice, to elect to purchase or acquire on the same terms and conditions, or on equivalent terms for a non-cash transaction, all of the Working Interest that the Disposing Party is proposing to transfer. If this preferential right is exercised by a Party, the purchasing or acquiring Parties shall share the purchased or acquired interest in the proportions that the Working Interest of each bears to the total Working Interest of all acquiring Parties, or in such proportions as the acquiring Parties otherwise agree. This preferential right shall apply separately to each Working Interest or part thereof covered by this Agreement, regardless of whether it is included in the proposed transaction along with other oil and gas interests, whether as a sale, farmout, or non-simultaneous, like-kind exchange, and no provision in this Agreement shall be interpreted to defeat this preferential right. Upon exercise of this preferential right, the acquiring Parties shall agree to perform all obligations of the prospective transferee under the proposed transaction only for the Working Interest subject to the proposed transaction. This preferential right, however, shall not exist or apply when a Party proposes (a) to mortgage its interest; (b) to dispose of or transfer its interest to an Affiliate by (i) merger, (ii) reorganization, or (iii) consolidation; (c) to sell all, or substantially all, of its exploration and production properties located in the United States of America; or (d) to transfer the interest under a property exchange transaction other than a non-simultaneous, like-kind exchange under Section 1031 of the Code. If the proposed transaction is not consummated within six (6) months after receipt of the notice by the other Parties, the Working Interest shall again be governed by this Section 25.6 and the preferential right shall again arise for the offered interest as herein described.

46
ARTICLE 26
TERM

26.1           Term.  This Agreement shall remain in effect so long any Lease or part thereof within the Contract Area remains in force and effect and thereafter until: (a) all wells within the Contract Area have been abandoned and plugged or turned over to a single Working Interest owner in accordance with Article 14; (b) all equipment and any real property acquired for the Joint Account has been disposed of by Operator; and (c) there has been a final accounting made under this Agreement, including settlement of any gas imbalances pursuant to Exhibit "D".  Termination of this Agreement shall not relieve a Party of any liability or obligation which accrued or was incurred before such termination.

ARTICLE 27
MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

27.1          Headings.  Except for the headings contained in Article 2 (Definitions), the headings and table of contents used herein are inserted for convenience only and shall be disregarded in construing this Agreement.
 
27.2          Waiver.  Failure to act upon a breach of any provision of this Agreement does not waive a Party's right to enforce a subsequent breach of the same or any other provision.

ARTICLE 28
EXECUTION

28.1           Counterpart Execution.  This Agreement may be executed by signing the original or a counterpart thereof.  If this Agreement is executed in counterparts, all counterparts taken together shall have the same effect as if all the Parties had signed the same instrument.

2.           Tax Reporting Partner and Tax Matters Partner

2.1           Tax Reporting Partner.
The Operator (or the Party listed in Sec. 9.1) as the Tax Reporting Partner (“TRP”) is responsible for compliance with all tax reporting obligations of the Partnership, see Sec. 3.1. below. In the event of any change in the TRP, the Party serving as the TRP at the beginning of a given taxable year shall continue as TRP with respect to all matters concerning such year.

2.2           IF SMALL PARTNERSHIP EXCEPTION FROM TEFRA NOT APPLICABLE
If the Partnership does not qualify for the “small partnership exception” from, or if the Partnership elects (see infra Elections at Sec. 4.1 and 9.2) to be subject to, §§6221 et seq., Subchapter C of Chapter 63 of Subtitle F (the “TEFRA rules”) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) the TRP shall also be the Tax Matters Partner as defined in Code §6231(a) (the “TMP”) and references to the TRP shall then include references to TMP and vice versa.
2.2.1
The TMP shall not be required to incur any expenses for the preparation for, or pursuance of, administrative or judicial proceedings, unless the Parties agree on a method for sharing such expenses.
2.2.2
The Parties shall furnish the TMP, within two weeks from the receipt of the request, the information the TMP may reasonably request to comply with the requirements on furnishing information to the Internal Revenue Service.
2.2.3
The TMP shall not agree to any extension of the statute of limitations for making assessments on behalf of the Partnership without first obtaining the written consent of all Parties. The TMP shall not bind any other Party to a settlement agreement in tax audits without obtaining the written concurrence of any such Party.
2.2.4
Any other Party who enters in a settlement agreement with the Secretary of the Treasury with respect to any partnership items, as defined in Code §6231(a)(3), shall notify the other Parties of the terms within ninety (90) days from the date of such settlement.
2.2.5
If any Party intends to file a notice of inconsistent treatment under Code §6222(b), such Party shall, prior to filing of such notice, notify the TMP of the (actual or potential) inconsistency of the Party’s intended treatment of a partnership item with the treatment of that item by the Partnership. Within one week of receipt the TMP shall remit copies of such notification to the other Parties. If an inconsistency notice is filed solely because a Party has not received a Schedule K-1 in time for filing of its income tax return, the TMP need not be notified.
2.2.6
No Party shall file pursuant to Code §6227 a request for an administrative adjustment of partnership items (the “RFAA”) without first notifying all other Parties. If all other Parties agree with the requested adjustment, the TMP shall file the RFAA on behalf of the Partnership. If unanimous consent is not obtained within thirty (30) days from such notice, or within the period required to timely file the RFAA, if shorter, any Party, including the TMP, may file a RFAA on its own behalf.
2.2.7
Any Party intending to file with respect to any partnership item, or any other tax matter involving the Partnership, a petition under Code §§6226, 6228, or any other provision, shall notify the other Parties prior to such filing of the nature of the contemplated proceeding. In the case where the TMP is the Party intending to file such petition, such notice shall be given within reasonable time to allow the other Parties to participate in the choice of the form of such petition. If the Parties do not agree on the appropriate forum, then the forum shall be chosen by majority vote. Each Party shall have a vote in accordance with its percentage interest in the Partnership for the year under audit. If a majority cannot agree, the TMP shall choose the forum. If a Party intends to seek review of any court decision rendered as a result of such proceeding, the Party shall notify the other Parties prior to seeking such review.

3.           Income Tax Compliance and Capital Accounts

3.1           Tax Returns.
The TRP shall prepare and file all required Federal and State partnership income tax returns. Not less than thirty (30) days prior to the return due date (including extensions), the TRP shall submit to each Party for review a copy of the return as proposed.

3.2           Fair Market Value Capital Accounts.
The TRP shall establish and maintain for each Party fair market value (“FMV”) capital accounts and tax basis capital accounts. Upon request, the TRP shall submit to each Party along with a copy of any proposed partnership income tax return an accounting of such Party’s FMV capital accounts as of the end of the return period.

3.3.        Information requests.
In addition to any obligation under Sec. 2.2.2, each Party agrees to furnish to the TRP not later than sixty (60) days before the return due date (including extensions) such information relating to the operations conducted under the Agreement as may be required for the proper preparation of such returns. Similarly, each Party agrees to furnish timely to the TRP, as requested, any the information and data necessary for the preparation and/or filing of other required reports and notifications, and for the computation of the capital accounts. As provided in Code  §6050K(c), a Party transferring its interest must notify the TRP to allow compliance with Code §6050K(a) (see also Sec.8.1).

4.
Tax and FMV Capital Account Elections

4.1        General Elections.
For both income tax and capital account purposes, the Partnership shall elect:
a)
to deduct when incurred intangible drilling and development costs (“IDC”);
b)
to use the maximum allowable accelerated tax method and the shortest permissible tax life for depreciation;
c)
the accrual method of accounting;
d)
to report income on a calendar year basis;
and the Partnership shall also make any elections as specially noted in Sec.9.2, below.

4.2        Depletion.
Solely for FMV capital account purposes, depletion shall be calculated by using simulated cost depletion within the meaning of Treas. Reg. §1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(k)(2), unless the use of simulated percentage depletion is elected in Sec.9.2, below. The simulated cost depletion allowance shall be determined under the principles of Code  §612 and be based on the FMV capital account basis of each Lease. Solely for purposes of this calculation, remaining shall be determined consistently by the TRP.

4.3        Election Out Under Code §761(a).
4.3.1
The TRP shall notify all Parties of an intended election to be excluded from the application of Subchapter K of Chapter 1 of the Code not later than sixty (60) days prior to the filling date or due date (including extensions) for the Federal partnership income tax return, whichever comes earlier. Any Party that does not consent must provide the TRP with written objection within thirty (30) days of such notice. Even after an effective election-out the TRP’s right and obligations, other than the relief from tax return filing obligations of the partnership, continue.
4.3.2
After an election-out, to avoid an unintended impairment of the election-out: The Parties will avoid, without prior coordination, any operational changes which could terminate the qualification for the election-out status; all Parties will monitor the continuing qualification of the Partnership for the election-out status and will notify the other Parties if, in their opinion, a change in operations will jeopardize the election-out; and, all Parties will use, unless agreed to by them otherwise, the cumulative gas balancing method as described in Treas. Reg. §1.761-2(d)(2).

4.4        Consent Requirements For Subsequent Tax Or FMV Capital Account Elections.
Unless stipulated differently in Sec. 9.3, future elections, in addition to or in amendment of those in this agreement, must be approved by the affirmative vote of two (2) or more Parties owning a majority of the working interest based upon post-Payout ownership.

5.
Capital Contributions and FMV Capital Accounts
The provisions of this Sec. 5 and any other provisions of the TPPs relating to the maintenance of the capital accounts are intended to comply with Treas. Reg. §1.704-1(b) and shall be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with such regulations.

5.1        Capital Contributions.
The respective capital contributions of each Party to the Partnership shall be (a) each Party’s interest in the oil and gas lease(s), including all associated lease and well equipment, committed to the Partnership, and (b) all accounts of money paid by each Party in connection with the acquisition, exploration, development, and operation of the lease(s), and all other costs characterized as contributions or expenses borne by such Party under the Agreement. The contribution of the leases and any other properties committed to the Partnership shall be made by each Party’s agreement to hold legal title to its interest in such leases or other property as nominee of the Partnership.

5.2        FMV Capital Accounts.
The FMV capital accounts shall be increased and decreased as follows:
5.2.1
The FMV capital account of a Party shall be increased by:
(i)
the amount of money and the FMV (as of the date of contribution) of any property contributed by such Party to the Partnership (net of liabilities assumed by the Partnership or to which the contributed property is subject);
(ii)
that Party’s share of Partnership items of income or gain, allocated in accordance with Sec. 6.1; and
(iii)
that Party’s share of any Code §705(a)(1)(B)item.
5.2.2
The FMV capital account of a Party shall be decreased by:
(i)
the amount of money and the FMV of property distributed to a Party (net of liabilities assumed by such Party or to which the property is subject):
(ii)
that Party’s Sec. 6.1 allocated share of Partnership loss and deductions, or items thereof; and,
(iii)
that Party’s share of any Code §705(a)(2)(B) item.
5.2.3
The “FMV” when it applies to property contributed by a Party to the Partnership shall be assumed, for purposes of Sec.5.2.1, to equal the adjusted tax basis, as defined in Code § 1011, of that property unless the Parties agree otherwise as indicated in Sec. 9.2.
5.2.4
As provided in Treas. Reg. §1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(e), upon distribution of Partnership property to a Party the capital accounts will be adjusted to reflect the manner in which the unrealized income, gain, loss and deduction inherent in distributed property (not previously reflected in the capital accounts) would be allocated among the Parties if there were a disposition of such property at its FMV as of the time of distribution. Furthermore, if so agreed to in Sec. 9.2, under the rules of Treas. Reg. §1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f), the FMV capital accounts shall be revalued at certain times to reflect value changes of the Partnership property.
5.2.5
The provisions of section 5 is intended to satisfy the requirements of section 704(b) of the Code and section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv) of the Treasury Regulations and shall be so construed and, if necessary, modified, to cause the allocation of profits, losses, income, gain and credit under section 6, to have substantial economic effect under such sections of the Code and Regulations, and in the event of any conflict between the provisions of this section 5.2 and such Regulations, the Regulations shall control.


F-3
6.
Partnership Allocations.

  6.1        FMV Capital Account Allocations.
Each item of income, gain, loss or deduction shall be allocated to each Party as follows:
6.1.1
Actual or deemed income from the sale, exchange, distribution or other disposition of production shall be allocated to the Party entitled to such production or the proceeds from the sale of such production. The amount received from the sale of production and the amount of the FMV of production taken in kind by the Parties are deemed to be identical; accordingly, such items may be omitted from the adjustments made to the Parties’ FMV capital accounts.
6.1.2
Exploration cost, IDC, operating and maintenance cost shall be allocated to each Party in accordance with its respective contribution, or obligation to contribute, to such cost.
6.1.3
Depreciation shall be allocated to each Party in accordance with its contributions, or obligations to contribute, to the cost of the underlying asset.
6.1.4
Simulated depletion shall be allocated to each Party in accordance with its FMV capital account adjusted basis in each oil and gas property of the Partnership.
6.1.5
Loss (or simulated loss) upon the sale, exchange, distribution, abandonment or other disposition of depreciable or depletable property shall be allocated to the Parties in the ratio of their respective FMV capital account adjusted bases n the depreciable or depletable property.
6.1.6
Gain (or simulated gain) upon the sale, exchange, distribution, or other disposition of depreciable or depletable property shall be allocated to the Parties so that the FMV capital account balances of the Parties will most closely reflect their respective percentage of fractional interests under the Agreement.
6.1.7
Costs or expenses of any other kind shall be allocated to each Party in accordance with its respective contribution, or obligation to contribute, to such cost or expense.
6.1.8
Any other income item shall be allocated to the Parties in accordance with the manner in which such income is realized by each Party.

6.2           Tax return and Tax Basis Capital Account allocations.
6.2.1
Unless otherwise expressly provided in the Sec. 6.2, the allocations of the Partnership’s items of income, gain, loss, or deduction for tax return and tax basis capital account purposes shall follow the principles of the allocation under Sec. 6.1. However, the Partnership’s gain or loss on the taxable disposition of a Partnership property in excess of the gain or loss under Sec 6.1, if any, is allocated to the contributing Party to the extent of such Party’s pre-contribution gain or loss.
6.2.2
The Parties recognize that under Code §613A(c)(7)(D) the depletion allowance is to be computed separately by each Party. For this purpose, each Party’s share of the adjusted tax basis in each oil and gas property shall be equal to its contribution to the adjusted tax basis of such property.
6.2.3
Under Code §613A(c)(7)(D) gain or loss on the disposition of an oil and gas property is to be computed separately by each Party. According to Treas. Reg. §1.704-1(b)(4)(v), the amount realized shall be allocated as follows: (i) An amount that represents recovery of the adjusted simulated depletion basis is allocated (without being credited t the capital accounts) to the Parties in the same proportion as the aggregate simulated depletion basis was allocated to such Parties under Sec. 5.2; and (ii) any remaining realization is allocated in accordance with Sec. 6.1.6.
6.2.4
Depreciation shall be allocated to each Party in accordance with its contribution to the adjusted tax basis of the depreciable asset.
6.2.5
In accordance with Treas. Reg. §1.1245-I(c), depreciation  recapture shall be allocated, to the extent possible, among the Parties to reflect their prior sharing of the depreciation.
6.2.6
In accordance with the principles of Treas. Reg. §1.1254-5, any recapture of IDC is determined and reported by each Party separately. Similarly, any recapture of depletion shall be computed separately by each Party, in accordance with its depletion allowance computed pursuant to Sec. 6.2.2.
6.2.7
For Partnership properties with FMV capital account values different from their adjusted tax bases the Parties intend that the allocations described in the Section 6.2 constitute a “reasonable method” of allocating gain or loss under Treas. Reg. §1.704-3(a)(1).
6.2.8
Take-in-kind.
If checked “Yes” in Sec. 9.2, below, each Party has the right to determine the market for its proportionate share of production. All items of income, deductions, and credits arising from such marketing of production shall be recognized by the Partnership and shall be allocated to the Party whose production is so marketed.


7.
Termination and Liquidating Distribution

7.1           Termination of the Partnership.
7.1.1
Upon termination, as provided in Code §708(b)(I)(A), the business shall be wound-up and concluded, and the assets shall be distributed to the Parties as described below by the end of such calendar year (or, if later, within ninety (90) days after the date of such termination). The assets shall be valued and distributed to the Parties in the order provided in Secs. 7.1.2, 7.5. and 7.7.
7.1.2
First, all cash representing unexpended contributions by any Party and any property in which no interest has been earned by any other Party under the Agreement shall be returned to the contributor.
 
7.2           Balancing of FMV Capital Accounts.
Second, the FMV capital accounts of the Parties shall be determined as described hereafter. The TRP shall take the actions specified under Secs. 7.2 through 7.5 in order to cause the ratios of the Parties’ FMV capital accounts to reflect as closely as possible their interests under the Agreement. The ratio of a Party’s FMV capital account is represented by a fraction, the numerator of which the Party’s FMV capital account balance and the denominator of which is the sum of all Parties’ FMV capital account balances. This is thereafter referred to as the “balancing of the FMV capital accounts” and, when completed, the FMV capital accounts of the Parties shall be referred to as “balanced”.

F-4
7.3           Deemed Sale Gain/Loss Charge Back.
The FMV of all Partnership properties shall be determined and the gain or loss for each property, which would have resulted if sold at such FMV, shall be allocated in accordance with Secs. 6.1.5 and 6.1.6.

7.4        Deficit make-up Obligation and Balancing Cash Contributions.
If hereafter a Party has a negative FMV capital account balance, that is a balance of less than zero, in accordance with Treas. Reg. §1.1704-I(b)(2)(ii)(b)(3) such Party is obligated to contribute, by the end of the taxable year, or if later, within ninety (90) days form the Partnership’s liquidation, an amount of money to the Partnership sufficient to achieve a zero balance FMV capital account (the “Deficit Make-Up Obligation”). Moreover, any Party may contribute an amount of cash to the Partnership to facilitate the balancing of the FMV capital accounts. If after these adjustments the FMV capital accounts are not balanced, Sec. 7.5 shall apply.

7.5           Distribution to balance capital accounts.
7.5.1
If all Parties agree, any cash or an undivided interest in certain selected properties shall be distributed to one or more Parties as necessary for the purpose of balancing the FMV capital accounts.
7.5.2
Distribution of undivided interests.
Unless Sec. 7 applies, an undivided interest in each and every property shall be distributed to one or more Parties in accordance with the ratios of their FMV capital accounts.

7.6           FMV determinations.
If a property is to be valued for purposes of balancing the capital accounts and making distributions under this Sec. 7, the Parties must first attempt to agree on the FMV of the property; failing such an agreement, the TRP shall cause a nationally recognized independent engineering firm to prepare an appraisal of the FMV of such property.

7.7           Final Distribution.
After the FMV capital accounts of the Parties have been adjusted pursuant to Secs. 7.2 to 7.5, all remaining property and interests then held by the Partnership shall be distributed to the Parties in accordance with their positive FMV capital account balances.

8.           Transfers and Correspondence

8.1           Transfer of Partnership Interests.
Transfers of Partnership interests shall be governed by the Agreement. A Party transferring its interest, or any part thereof, shall notify the TRP in writing within two weeks after such transfer.

ARTICLE 4
OPERATOR

4.1           Operator. RIDGELAKE ENERGY, INC. is hereby designated as Operator for the purposes of this Agreement, and for all operations conducted on or related to the Contract Area.
 
4.2           Resignation or Removal of Operator.  Operator may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to Non-Operators.  In addition, Operator may be removed by the affirmative vote of the Parties owning a combined Working Interest of fifty-one percent (51%) or more after excluding Operator’s Working Interest if:
 
 
(a)
Operator becomes insolvent or unable to pay its debts as they mature, makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, commits an act of bankruptcy, or seeks relief under laws providing for the relief of debtors; or
 
(b)
a receiver is appointed for Operator or for substantially all of its property or affairs.
 
(c)
Operator sells, trades, transfers or assigns all or a portion of its Working Interest, thereby reducing its Working Interest to less than ten percent (10%); or
 
(d)
Operator commits a substantial breach of a material provision of this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within sixty (60) days after receipt of a Non-operator’s notice to Operator of such breach.
 
The resignation or removal of the Operator shall become effective as soon as practical, but not later than 7:00 o'clock a.m. on the first day of the calendar month following a period of ninety (90) days after i) the date of notice of resignation by Operator or ii) the date of receipt of written notice by Operator from Non-Operator detailing the alleged grounds for removal and Operator has failed to cure same within sixty (60) days from its receipt of the notice, unless a longer period is required for the Parties to obtain approval of the designation of the successor Operator by the MMS; however, in no event shall the resignation or removal of Operator become effective until a successor Operator has assumed the duties of Operator.  Upon approval of the designation of the successor Operator by the MMS, the resigning or removed Operator shall be bound by the terms of this Joint Operating Agreement as a Non-Operator.  A change of a corporate name or structure of Operator or transfer of Operator’s interest to any single subsidiary, parent or successor corporation shall not be the basis for removal of Operator.

 
4
 

4.3           Selection of Successor.  Upon resignation or removal of Operator, a successor Operator shall be selected by an affirmative vote of the Parties having a combined majority Working Interest.  However, if the removed or resigned Operator fails to vote or votes only to succeed itself, the successor Operator shall be selected by an affirmative vote of the Parties having a combined Working Interest of fifty-one percent (51%) or more of the remaining Working Interest left after excluding the Working Interest of the removed or resigned Operator.  In no event shall the resignation or removal of Operator become finally effective unless and until a successor Operator has been elected and assumed its duties.
 
4.4           Delivery of Property.  Prior to the effective date of resignation or removal, the former Operator shall deliver to the successor Operator all records and data relating to the operations conducted by the former Operator that the successor Operator is entitled to have and that are not already in the possession of the successor Operator, as well as all other property in the possession of the former Operator that was acquired for the Joint Account.
 
4.5           Liability of Operator.  If Operator resigns, or if Operator is removed as Operator, such resignation, or removal shall not relieve Operator of any liabilities it may have to Non-Operator(s) or third parties for damages arising out of Operator's breach of this Agreement.
 
4.6           Removal and Selection of a Successor Operator in a Two-party Agreement.  If this Agreement involves only two parties, the following provisions shall apply:
 
 
4.6.1  On the occurrence of an event specified in Section 4.2 that allows removal of Operator, Non-Operator shall have the option of either becoming Operator or allowing Operator to continue in that position.
 
 
4.6.2  If Operator resigns, Non-Operator, at its option, shall have the option of either becoming Operator or terminating this Agreement.
 
4.7           Designation of Operator.  The Parties hereto agree to execute such Designation of Operator forms as are required to have the Operator or its successor properly designated as operator with the Minerals Management Service or any other governmental authority having jurisdiction over the Lease and the operations conducted thereunder.



ARTICLE 5
AUTHORITY AND DUTIES OF OPERATOR

5.1           Exclusive Right to Operate.  Unless otherwise provided, Operator shall have the exclusive right to conduct all operations pursuant to this Agreement.  In performing services under this Agreement for the Non-Operator, Operator shall be an independent contractor, not subject to the control or direction of Non-Operator, except for the type of operation to be undertaken in accordance with the voting and election procedures contained within this Agreement.  Operator shall not be deemed to be, or hold itself out as, the agent or fiduciary of Non-Operator.
 
5
5.2           Workmanlike Conduct.  Operator shall conduct all operations in a good and workmanlike manner as would a prudent operator under the same or similar circumstances.  Operator shall not be liable to Non-Operator for losses sustained or liabilities incurred, except such as may result from Operator’s gross negligence or willful misconduct.  Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, Operator shall consult with Non-Operator and keep them informed of all important matters.  However, Operator shall never be required under this Agreement to conduct an operation that it believes would be unsafe or would endanger persons or property.
 
5.3           Liens and Encumbrances.  Operator shall endeavor to keep the Lease within the Contract Area and equipment free from all liens and encumbrances occasioned by operations hereunder, except those provided for in Section 8.5 (Security Rights).
 
5.4           Employees.  The number of employees and their selection, and the hours of labor and compensation for services performed shall be determined by Operator.  Except as provided in Exhibit “C”, such employees shall be the employees of Operator.
 
5.5           Records.  Operator shall keep accurate books, accounts, and records of operations under this Agreement, which, unless otherwise provided for in this Agreement, shall be available to Non-Operator as provided in Exhibit "C".
 
5.6           Compliance.  Operator shall comply with, and require all agents and contractors to comply with, all applicable laws, rules, regulations and orders of any governmental authorities having jurisdiction.
 
5.7           Contractors.  Operator may enter into contracts with independent contractors for the design, construction, installation, or operation of Platforms and Facilities.  Insofar as possible, Operator shall use competitive bidding to procure goods and services for the benefit of the Parties.  All drilling operations conducted under this Agreement shall be conducted by qualified and responsible drilling contractors under current competitive contracts.  A drilling contract will be deemed to be a current competitive contract if it (a) was made within one hundred (180) days before the commencement of the well and (b) contains terms, rates, and provisions that, when the contract was made, did not exceed those generally prevailing in the area for operations involving substantially equivalent rigs that are capable of drilling the proposed well.  At its election, Operator may use its own or an Affiliate’s drilling equipment, derrick barge, tools, or machinery to conduct drilling operations, but the work shall be (a) performed by Operator acting as an independent contractor, (b) approved by written agreement with the Participating Parties before commencement of operations, and (c) conducted under the same terms and conditions and at the same rates as are customary and prevailing in competitive contracts  of third parties doing work of a similar nature.  Before awarding a drilling contract or performing work with its own or an Affiliate’s drilling equipment, derrick barge, tools, or machinery, Operator shall attempt to obtain competitive bids for the work from independent contractors.

 
6
 

5.8           Governmental Reports.  Operator shall make reports to governmental authorities that it has a duty to make as Operator and shall furnish copies of such reports to the Participating Parties.

A copy of application for permit to drill and all amendments thereto.
 
(b)
Daily drilling reports.
 
(c)
A complete report of all core analyses, if any.

Non-Operator shall give Operator at least twenty-four (24) hours’ notice of Non-Operator’s intention to visit the Lease.  To protect Operator and Non-Operator from unnecessary lawsuits, claims, and legal liability, if it is necessary for a person who is not performing services for Operator directly related to a joint operation, but is performing services solely for a Non-Operator or pertaining to the business or operations of a Non-Operator, to visit, use, or board a rig, Platform, or Facility on a Lease subject to this agreement, the Non-Operator shall give Operator advance notice of the visit, use or boarding, and shall secure from that person an agreement, in a form satisfactory to Operator, indemnifying and holding Operator and Non-Operator harmless, or shall itself provide the same hold harmless and indemnification in favor of Operator and the other Non-Operators before the visit, use, or boarding.


7.2           Reports.  Upon written request, Operator shall furnish a requesting Party any information not otherwise furnished under Article 5 to which such Party is otherwise entitled under this Agreement.

Operator is not obligated to furnish interpretative data that was generated by Operator at its sole cost.

7.3           Confidentiality.  For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "Confidential Information" shall mean any geological, geophysical, engineering, technical, production test, exploratory, or reservoir information, or any logs or other information pertaining to any well drilled pursuant to this Agreement or any operation conducted under the terms of this Agreement to the extent that such information was acquired at joint expense.  Except as provided in Section 7.5 and except for necessary disclosures to governmental authorities having jurisdiction, no Party shall during the term of this Agreement and for a period of three (3) years thereafter, trade, sell, publish or release any such Confidential Information without the agreement of all Participating Parties.  Otherwise, the Parties shall jointly own all such Confidential Information without duty to account.  Each Party's obligation to protect Confidential Information shall be considered met by each Party using at least the same degree of care as it uses in protecting its own proprietary materials of like kind.
 
7.4           Exceptions.  No Party shall have any obligation to limit disclosure or use any portion of Confidential Information which:
 
 
(a)
is already in that Party's possession prior to receipt as a result of this Agreement;
 
(b)
is now in or hereafter becomes publicly available through no fault of that Party;
 
(c)
is disclosed to that Party without obligation of confidence by a third party which has the right to make such disclosure; or;
 
(d)
is independently developed by or for such Party without reference to information received under this Agreement.
 
7.5           Limited Disclosure.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Parties may make Confidential Information available to third parties as follows:
 
 
(a)
outside professional consultants  and reputable engineering firms for the purpose of evaluations;

(f)
third parties with whom a party is engaged in a bona fide effort to effect a merger or consolidation, sell all or a controlling part of that Party’s stock, or sell all or substantially all assets of that Party or an Affiliate of that Party;
 
(g)
an Affiliate of a Party; and
 
(h)
third parties with whom a Party is engaged in a bona fide effort to sell, farmout, or trade all or a portion of its interest in the Lease.
 
Confidential Information made available under Subsections 7.4(f) and 7.4(h) shall not be removed from the custody or premises of the Party making the Confidential Information available to third parties as described in those Subsections.  Also, a third party permitted access under Subsections 7.4(a), (b), (c), (f) and (h) shall first agree in writing neither to disclose the Confidential Information to others nor to use the Confidential Information, except for the purpose for which it was disclosed.  The disclosing Party shall give prior notice to the other Parties that it intends to make the Confidential Information available.

7.6           Proceeds.  During the term of this Agreement, the Parties agree that any proceeds obtained from the sale of Confidential Information (excluding, however, transfers of Confidential Information incidental to a Party’s sale of all or any portion of its interest in the Contract Area) shall be shared by the Parties in proportion to their share of the total costs and expenses to acquire same.
 
7.7           Media Releases.  Except as agreed by all parties or otherwise permitted by this Section, no Party shall issue a news or media release about operations on the Lease.  In an emergency involving extensive property damage, operations failure, loss of human life, or other clear emergency, and for which there is insufficient time to obtain the prior approval of the Parties, Operator may furnish the minimum, strictly factual, information necessary to satisfy the legitimate public interest of the media and governmental authorities having jurisdiction.  Operator shall then promptly advise the other Parties of the information furnished in response to the emergency.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, upon prior written notice to the other Parties, a Party shall be allowed to make any press release or announcement required by a recognized stock exchange on which the Party’s (or its Affiliate’s) stock is listed; provided, however, that the press release shall contain the following statement: “The information, opinions or projections contained in this press release are (the disclosing Party’s) and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of its co-owners.”

EXPENDITURES

8.1           Basis of Charge to the Parties.

8.2           Authorization.  Prior to undertaking any project or making any single expenditure related to the Contract Area in excess of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00), Operator shall submit for the approval of the Parties an Authorization for Expenditure ("AFE") for such project or expenditure.  Operator shall furnish written information to all the Parties on any project or single expenditure costing less than One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00) but in excess of Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00) if Operator prepares same for its own use.  Notwithstanding the One Hundred Thousand Dollar ($100,000.00) limitation, where such project or expenditure involves changing zones in a well or a workover operation, an AFE shall be submitted to the Parties for approval.  Approval of a Development Well or an Exploratory Well operation shall include approval of all necessary expenditures through drilling, coring and logging to the objective depth and plugging and abandoning costs, if applicable.  In the event of an actual or imminently threatened blowout, explosion, accident, fire, flood, storm, or other emergency, Operator may immediately conduct such operations and make such expenditures as in its opinion are required to overcome the emergency, including, but not limited to, any and all measures to protect life, health, safety, property, natural resources or the environment.  Operator shall report to the Parties, as promptly as possible, the nature of the emergency and action taken.  The Operator shall provide supplemental AFE’s to Participating Parties, for informational purposes only, if it reasonably determines that the expected actual costs of an operation will exceed the amount of the approved AFE by 15% or more, but only if the dollar amount of such expected excess is greater than Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000.00).
 
10
8.3           Advance Billings.  Operator shall have the right to require each Party to advance its respective share of estimated expenditures pursuant to Exhibit "C".

8.5           Security Rights (Louisiana).  In addition to any other security rights and remedies provided by law with respect to services rendered or materials and equipment furnished under this Agreement, for and in consideration of the covenants and mutual undertakings of the Operator and the Non-operators herein, the Parties shall have the following security rights:
(a)           Mortgage in Favor of the Operator.  Each Non-operator hereby grants to the Operator a mortgage, hypothecate, and pledge of and over all of its rights, titles, and interests in and to (a) the Lease within the Contract Area, (b) the oil, gas and other minerals in, on, under, and that may be produced from the lands within the Contract Area, and (c) all other immovable property susceptible of mortgage situated within the Contract Area.
 
This mortgage is given to secure the complete and timely performance of and payment by each Non-operator of all obligations and indebtedness of every kind and nature, whether now owed by such Non-operator or hereafter arising, pursuant to this Agreement.  To the extent susceptible under applicable law, this mortgage and the security interests granted in favor of the Operator herein shall secure the payment of all costs and other expenses properly charged to such Party, together with (A) interest on such indebtedness, costs, and other expenses at the rate set forth in Exhibit "C" attached hereto (the "Accounting Procedure") or the maximum rate allowed by law, whichever is the lesser, (B) reasonable attorneys' fees, (C) court costs, and (D) other directly related collection costs.  If any Non-operator does not pay such costs and other expenses or perform its obligations under this Agreement when due, the Operator shall have the additional right to notify the purchaser or purchasers of the defaulting Non-operator's production of oil, gas and other minerals and collect such costs and other expenses out of the proceeds from the sale of the defaulting Non-operator's share of production of oil, gas and other minerals until the amount owed has been paid.  The Operator shall have the right to offset the amount owed against the proceeds from the sale of such defaulting Non-operator's share of production of oil, gas and other minerals.  Any purchaser of such production shall be entitled to rely on the Operator's statement concerning the amount of costs and other expenses owed by the defaulting Non-operator and payment made to the Operator by any purchaser shall be binding and conclusive as between such purchaser and such defaulting Non-operator.
 
The maximum amount for which the mortgage herein granted by each Non-operator shall be deemed to secure the obligations and indebtedness of such Non-operator to the Operator as stipulated herein is hereby fixed in an amount equal to $25,000,000.00 (the "Limit of the Mortgage of each Non-operator").  Except as provided in the previous sentence (and then only to the extent such limitations are required by law), the entire amount of obligations and indebtedness of each Non-operator to the Operator is secured hereby without limitation.  Notwithstanding the foregoing Limit of the Mortgage of each Non-operator, the liability of each Non-operator under this Agreement and the mortgage and security interest granted hereby shall be limited to (and the Operator shall not be entitled to enforce the same against such Non-operator for, an amount exceeding) the actual obligations and indebtedness [including all interest charges, costs, attorneys' fees, and other charges provided for in this Agreement or in the Memorandum of Operating Agreement and Financing Statement (Louisiana), as such term is defined in Article 8.5.(e) (Recordation) hereof] outstanding and unpaid and that are attributable to or charged against the interest of such Non-operator pursuant to this Agreement.

To secure the complete and timely performance of and payment by each Non-operator of all obligations and indebtedness of every kind and nature, whether now owed by such Non-operator or hereafter arising, pursuant to this Agreement, each Non-operator hereby grants to the Operator a continuing security interest in and to all of its rights, titles, interests, claims, general intangibles, proceeds, and products thereof, whether now existing or hereafter acquired, in and to (a) all oil, gas and other minerals produced from the lands or offshore blocks covered by the Leases within the Contract Area or attributable to the Leases within the Contract Area when produced, (b) all accounts receivable accruing or arising as a result of the sale of such oil, gas and other minerals (including, without limitation, accounts arising from gas imbalances or from the sale of oil, gas and other minerals at the wellhead), (c) all cash or other proceeds from the sale of such oil, gas and other minerals once produced, and (d) all Platforms and Facilities, wells, fixtures, other corporeal property, whether movable or immovable, whether now or hereafter placed on the lands or offshore blocks covered by the Leases within the Contract Area or maintained or used in connection with the ownership, use or exploitation of the Leases within the Contract Area, and other surface and sub-surface equipment of any kind or character located on or attributable to the Leases within the Contract Area and the cash or other proceeds realized from the sale, transfer, disposition or conversion thereof.  The interest of the Non-operators in and to the oil and gas produced from or attributable to the Leases within the Contract Area when extracted and the accounts receivable accruing or arising as the result of the sale thereof shall be financed at the wellhead of the well or wells located on the Leases within the Contract Area.  To the extent susceptible under applicable law, the security interest granted by each Non-operator hereunder covers: (A) all substitutions, replacements, and accessions to the property of such Non-operator described herein and is intended to cover all of the rights, titles and interests of such Non-operator in all movable property now or hereafter located upon or used in connection with the Leases within the Contract Area, whether corporeal or incorporeal; (B) all rights under any gas balancing agreement, farmout rights, option farmout rights, acreage and cash contributions, and conversion rights of such Non-operator in connection with the Leases within the Contract Area, or the oil, gas and other minerals produced from or attributable to the Leases within the Contract Area, whether now owned and existing or hereafter acquired or arising, including, without limitation, all interests of each Non-operator in any partnership, tax partnership, limited partnership, association, joint venture, or other entity or enterprise that holds, owns, or controls any interest in the Leases within the Contract Area; and (C) all rights, claims, general intangibles, and proceeds, whether now existing or hereafter acquired, of each Non-operator in and to the contracts, agreements, permits, licenses, rights-of-way, and similar rights and privileges that relate to or are appurtenant to the Leases within the Contract Area, including the following:

 
12
 

(1)           all of its rights, titles, and interests, whether now owned and existing or hereafter acquired or arising, in, to, and under or derived from any present or future operating, farmout, bidding, pooling, unitization, and communitization agreements, assignments, and subleases, whether or not described in Exhibit "A," to the extent, and only to the extent, that such agreements, assignments, and subleases cover or include any of its rights, titles, and interests, whether now owned and existing or hereafter acquired or arising, in and to all or any portion of the Leases within the Contract Area, and all units created by any such pooling, unitization, and communitization agreements and all units formed under orders, regulations, rules, or other official acts of any governmental authority having jurisdiction, to the extent and only to the extent that such units cover or include all or any portion of the Leases within the Contract Area;
 
(2)           all of its rights, titles, and interests, whether now owned and existing or hereafter acquired or arising, in, to, and under or derived from all presently existing and future advance payment agreements, and oil, casinghead gas, and gas sales, exchange, and processing contracts and agreements, including, without limitation, those contracts and agreements that are described on Exhibit "A," to the extent, and only to the extent, those contracts and agreements cover or include all or any portion of the Leases within the Contract Area; and
 
(3)           all of its rights, titles, and interests, whether now owned and existing or hereafter acquired or arising, in, to, and under or derived from all existing and future permits, licenses, rights-of-way, and similar rights and privileges that relate to or are appurtenant to the Leases within the Contract Area.
 
(c)           Mortgage in Favor of the Non-operators.  The Operator hereby grants to each Non-operator a mortgage, hypothecate, and pledge of and over all of its rights, titles, and interests in and to (a) the Lease within the Contract Area; (b) the oil, gas and other minerals in, on, under, and that my be produced from the lands within the Lease within the Contract Area; and (c) all other immovable property or other property susceptible of mortgage situated within the Lease within the Contract Area.
 
This mortgage is given to secure the complete and timely performance of and payment by the Operator of all obligations and indebtedness of every kind and nature, whether now owed by the Operator or hereafter arising, pursuant to this Agreement.  To the extent susceptible under applicable law, this mortgage and the security interests granted in favor of each Non-operator herein shall secure the payment of all costs and other expenses properly charged to the Operator, together with (A) interest on such indebtedness, costs, and other expenses at the rate set forth in Exhibit “C” or the maximum rate allowed by law, whichever is the lesser, (B) reasonable attorneys' fees, (C) court costs, and (D) other directly related collection costs.

The Non-operators shall have the right to offset the amount owed against the proceeds from the sale of the Operator’s share of production of oil, gas and other minerals.  Any purchaser of such production shall be entitled to rely on the Non-operators’ statement concerning the amount of costs and other expenses owed by the Operator and payment made to the Non-operators by any purchaser shall be binding and conclusive as between such purchaser and the Operator.

The maximum amount for which the mortgage herein granted by the Operator shall be deemed to secure the obligations and indebtedness of the Operator to all Non-operators as stipulated herein is hereby fixed in an amount equal to $25,000,000.00 in the aggregate (the "Limit of the Mortgage of the Operator").  Except as provided in the previous sentence (and then only to the extent such limitations are required by law), the entire amount of obligations and indebtedness of the Operator to the Non-operators is secured hereby without limitation.  Notwithstanding the foregoing Limit of the Mortgage of the Operator, the liability of the Operator under this Agreement and the mortgage and security interest granted hereby shall be limited to (and the Non-operators shall not be entitled to enforce the same against the Operator for, an amount exceeding) the actual obligations and indebtedness [including all interest charges, costs, attorneys' fees, and other charges provided for in this Agreement or in the Memorandum of Operating Agreement and Financing Statement (Louisiana), as such term is defined in Article 8.5.(e) hereof] outstanding and unpaid and that are attributable to or charged against the interest of the Operator pursuant to this Agreement.
 
(d)           Security Interest in Favor of the Non-operators.  To secure the complete and timely performance of and payment by the Operator of all obligations and indebtedness of every kind and nature, whether now owed by the Operator or hereafter arising, pursuant to this Agreement, the Operator hereby grants to each Non-operator a continuing security interest in and to all of its rights, titles, interests, claims, general intangibles, proceeds, and products thereof, whether now existing or hereafter acquired, in and to (a) all oil, gas and other minerals produced from the lands or offshore blocks covered by the Leases within the Contract Area or included within the Leases within the Contract Area or attributable to the Leases within the Contract Area when produced, (b) all accounts receivable accruing or arising as a result of the sale of such oil, gas and other minerals (including, without limitation, accounts arising from gas imbalances or from the sale of oil, gas and other minerals at the wellhead), (c) all cash or other proceeds from the sale of such oil, gas and other minerals once produced, and (d) all Platforms and Facilities, wells, fixtures, other corporeal property whether movable or immovable, whether now or hereafter placed on the offshore blocks covered by the Leases within the Contract Area or maintained or used in connection with the ownership, use or exploitation of the Leases within the Contract Area, and other surface and sub-surface equipment of any kind or character located on or attributable to the Leases within the Contract Area and the cash or other proceeds realized from the sale, transfer, disposition or conversion thereof.  The interest of the Operator in and to the oil, gas and other minerals produced from or attributable to the Leases within the Contract Area when extracted and the accounts receivable accruing or arising as the result of the sale thereof shall be financed at the wellhead of the well or wells located on the Leases within the Contract Area. To the extent susceptible under applicable law, the security interest granted by the Operator hereunder covers: (A) all substitutions, replacements, and accessions to the property of the Operator described herein and is intended to cover all of the rights, titles and interests of the Operator in all movable property now or hereafter located upon or used in connection with the Leases within the Contract Area, whether corporeal or incorporeal; (B) all rights under any gas balancing agreement, farmout rights, option farmout rights, acreage and cash contributions, and conversion rights of the Operator in connection with the Leases within the Contract Area, the oil, gas and other minerals produced from or attributable to the Leases within the Contract Area, whether now owned and existing or hereafter acquired or arising, including, without limitation, all interests of the Operator in any partnership, tax partnership, limited partnership, association, joint venture, or other entity or enterprise that holds, owns, or controls any interest in the Leases within the Contract Area; and (C) all rights, claims, general intangibles, and proceeds, whether now existing or hereafter acquired, of the Operator in and to the contracts, agreements, permits, licenses, rights-of-way, and similar rights and privileges that relate to or are appurtenant to the Leases within the Contract Area, including the following:
 
 
14
 
(1)           all of its rights, titles, and interests, whether now owned and existing or hereafter acquired or arising, in, to, and under or derived from any present or future operating, farmout, bidding, pooling, unitization, and communitization agreements, assignments, and subleases, whether or not described in Exhibit "A," to the extent, and only to the extent, that such agreements, assignments, and subleases cover or include any of its rights, titles, and interests, whether now owned and existing or hereafter acquired or arising, in and to all or any portion of the Leases within the Contract Area, and all units created by any such pooling, unitization, and communitization agreements and all units formed under orders, regulations, rules, or other official acts of any governmental authority having jurisdiction, to the extent and only to the extent that such units cover or include all or any portion of the Leases within the Contract Area;

(3)           all of its rights, titles, and interests, whether now owned and existing or hereafter acquired or arising, in, to, and under or derived from all existing and future permits, licenses, rights-of-way, and similar rights and privileges that relate to or are appurtenant to any of the Leases within the Contract Area.
 
15
(e)           Recordation.  To provide evidence of, and to further perfect the Parties' security rights created hereunder, upon request, each Party shall execute and acknowledge the Memorandum of Operating Agreement and Financing Statement (Louisiana) attached as Exhibit "E" (the "Memorandum of Operating Agreement and Financing Statement (Louisiana)") in multiple counterparts as appropriate.  The Party requesting execution of the aforesaid document shall file the Memorandum of Operating Agreement and Financing Statement (Louisiana) in the public records set forth below at its sole cost and expense to serve as notice of the existence of this Agreement as a burden on the title of the Operator and the Non-operators to their interests in the Leases within the Contract Area and for purposes of satisfying otherwise relevant recording and filing requirements of applicable law and to attach an original of the Memorandum of Operating Agreement and Financing Statement (Louisiana) to a standard UCC-1 in mutually agreeable forms for filing in the UCC records set forth below to perfect the security interests created by the Parties in this Agreement.  Upon the acquisition of a leasehold interest in a Lease within the Contract Area, the Parties shall, within five business days following request by one of the Parties hereto, execute and furnish to the requesting Party for recordation such a Memorandum of Operating Agreement and Financing Statement (Louisiana) describing such leasehold interest.  Such Memorandum of Operating Agreement and Financing Statement (Louisiana) shall be amended from time to time upon acquisition of additional leasehold interests in the Leases within the Contract Area, and the Parties shall, within five business days following request by one of the Parties hereto, execute and furnish to the requesting Party for recordation any such amendment.
 
The Memorandum of Operating Agreement and Financing Statement (Louisiana) is to be filed or recorded, as the case may be, in (a) the conveyance records of the parish or parishes adjacent to the lands or offshore blocks covered by the Leases within the Contract Area or contained within the Leases within the Contract Area pursuant to La. R.S. 9:2731 et seq., (b) the mortgage records of such parish or parishes, and (c) the appropriate Uniform Commercial Code records.

 
16
 

 
 
8.6           Default.  If any Party does not pay its share of the charges authorized under this Agreement when due, the Operator may give the defaulting Party notice that unless payment is made within thirty (30) days from delivery of the notice, the non-paying Party shall be in default.  A Party in default shall have no further access to the rig, Platform or Facilities, any Confidential Information or other maps, records, data, interpretations, or other information obtained in connection with activities or operations hereunder or be allowed to participate in meetings.  A Party in default shall not be entitled to vote or to make an election until such time as the defaulting Party is no longer in default.  The voting interest of each non-defaulting Party shall be counted in the proportion its Participating Interest share bears to the total non-defaulting Participating Interest shares.  As to any operation approved during the time a Party is in default, such defaulting Party shall be deemed to be a Non-participating Party, except where such approval is binding on all Parties or Participating Parties, as applicable. In the event a Party believes that such statement of charges is incorrect, the Party shall nevertheless pay the amounts due as provided herein, and the Operator shall attempt to resolve the issue as soon as practicable, but said attempt shall be made no later than sixty (60) days after receiving notice from the Party of such disputed charges.
 
17
8.7           Unpaid Charges.  If any Participating Party fails to pay its share of the costs and other expenses authorized under this Agreement in accordance with Exhibit “C” or to otherwise perform any of its obligations under this Agreement when due, the Party to whom such payment is due, in order to take advantage of the provisions of Article 8.5, shall notify the other Party by certified or registered U.S. Mail that it is in default and has thirty (30) days from the receipt of such notice to pay.  If such payment is not made timely by the non-paying Party after the issuance of such notice to pay, the Party requesting such payment may take immediate steps to diligently pursue collection of the unpaid costs and other expenses owed by such Participating Party and to exercise the mortgage and security rights granted by this Agreement.  The bringing of a suit and the obtaining of a judgment by any Party for the secured indebtedness shall not be deemed an election of remedies or otherwise affect the security rights granted herein.  In addition to any other remedy afforded by law, each Party shall have, and is hereby given and vested with, the power and authority to foreclose the lien, mortgage, pledge, and security interest established hereby in its favor in the manner provided by law, to exercise all rights of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code as adopted by the state in which the Leases within the Contract Area are located or such other states as such Party may deem appropriate.  The Operator shall keep an accurate account of amounts owed by the nonperforming Party (plus interest and collection costs) and any amounts collected with respect to amounts owed by the nonperforming Party.  In the event there become three or more Parties to this Agreement, then if any nonperforming Party's share of costs remains delinquent for a period of sixty (60) days, each other Participating Party shall, upon the Operator's request, pay the unpaid amount of costs in the proportion that its Working Interest bears to the total non-defaulting Working Interests.  Each Participating Party paying its share of the unpaid amounts of a nonperforming Party shall be subrogated to the Operator's mortgage and security rights to the extent of the payment made by such Participating Party.
 
8.8           Carved-out Interests.  Except for the “Permitted Encumbrance” identified on Exhibit “A”, any agreements creating any overriding royalty, production payment, net proceeds interest, net profits interest, carried interest or any other interest carved out of a Working Interest in the Leases within the Contract Area shall specifically make such interests inferior to the rights of the Parties to this Agreement. If any Party whose Working Interest is so encumbered does not pay its share of costs and other expenses authorized under this Agreement, and the proceeds from the sale of its production of oil, gas and other minerals pursuant to Article 8.5 are insufficient to pay such costs and expenses, the security rights provided for in this Article 8.5 may be applied against the carved-out interests with which the defaulting or non-performing Party’s interest in the Leases within the Contract Area is burdened. In such event, the rights of the owner of such carved-out interest shall be subordinated to the security rights granted by Article 8.5.

All notices and responses thereto shall be in writing and delivered in person or by telephone followed by United States mail, telex, telegraph, telecopier (facsimile) or cable; however, if a drilling rig is on location and standby charges are accumulating, such notices and responses shall be given by telephone and immediately confirmed in writing.  Notices and responses shall be deemed given only when received by the Party to whom such notice or response is directed, except that any notice or response by certified United States mail or equivalent, telegraph, or cable properly addressed, pursuant to Section 6.1, and with all postage and charges prepaid shall be deemed given seventy-two (72) hours after such notice is deposited in the mail exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays, or twenty-four (24) hours after such notice or response is sent by telecopier (facsimile), receipt confirmed, or filed with an operating telegraph or cable company for immediate transmission exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays.
 
9.2           Content of Notice.  Any notice which requires a response shall indicate the response time specified in Section 9.3.  If a proposal involves a Platform, Facility or Subsequent Facility, the notice shall contain a description of same, including location and the estimated costs of design fabrication, transportation and installation.  If a proposal involves an Exploratory Operation or a Development Operation, the notice shall include the proposed depth, the objective zone or zones to be tested, the surface and bottom-hole locations, applicable details regarding directional drilling, the equipment to be used, and the estimated costs of the operation including all necessary expenditures through installation of the wellhead or abandonment of the well.
 
9.3           Response to Notices.  Each Party's response to a proposal shall be in writing to all other Parties.  Unless otherwise specified herein, response times shall be as follows:
 
9.3.1
Platform Construction.  When any proposal for well operations involves the construction of a Platform, each Party shall respond within sixty (60) days after receipt of notice.
 
 
 
19
 
9.3.2
Proposal Without Platform.  When any proposal for well operations does not require construction of a Platform, each Party shall respond within thirty (30) days after receipt of notice.  However, if a drilling rig is on location as a result of a joint Exploratory or Development Operation previously conducted thereon and standby charges are accumulating, the response shall be made within twenty-four (24) hours, inclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays, after receipt of notice.
 
9.3.3
Other Matters.  For all other matters requiring notice, each Party shall respond within thirty (30) days after receipt of notice.
 
9.4           Failure to Respond.  Failure of any Party to respond to a proposal or notice, to vote, or to elect to participate within the period required by this Agreement shall be deemed to be a negative response, vote, or election.
 
9.5           Restrictions on Multiple Well Proposals.  Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, it is specifically provided that no notice shall be given under this Article 9 hereof which simultaneously proposes the drilling of more than two (2) wells, or proposes the drilling of more than one (1) more well while there is an outstanding proposal.  Further, these provisions of this Article 9, insofar as they pertain to notification by a Party of its desire to drill a well, shall be suspended for so long as: (1) a prior notice has been given which is still in force and effect and the period of time during which the well regarding same may be commenced has not expired; or (2) a well is presently drilling hereunder.  This section shall not apply under those circumstances where the well to which notice is directed is a well which is required under the terms of a Lease or one required to maintain a portion thereof in force.  In the event drilling operations are necessary to perpetuate a Lease, any Party may propose and commence the drilling of such additional well(s) pursuant to the terms and conditions hereof no earlier than one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the date operations must be commenced, regardless of other proposals then under consideration or drilling operations then in progress.



ARTICLE 10
EXPLORATORY OPERATIONS

10.1           Operations by All Parties.  Any Party may propose an Exploratory Well by notifying the other Parties.  If all the Parties agree to participate in drilling the proposed well, Operator shall drill same at their cost and risk.  If a mobile drilling rig is not already on location as a result of a prior Exploratory or Development Operation and the proposal ("Original Proposal") has not already been approved, then any Party may submit an alternate well proposal for consideration within ten (10) days after receiving the Original Proposal to drill a well.  If one or more alternate proposals have been submitted in accordance with the foregoing, then the Operator shall call a meeting of the Parties to be held within seven (7) days following receipt of the alternate proposal(s), at which the Parties shall determine by majority vote in interest which proposal shall be considered by the Joint Account.  In the event that no proposal receives support of a majority in interest, then the proposal receiving the greatest support shall prevail.  In the event of a tie between two or more proposals, then the proposal (including the Original Proposal) supported by the largest number of Parties shall prevail.  Each Party having the right to participate in the proposal so selected shall make its election whether to join in the drilling of such well within fifteen (15) days after the meeting was held.  If drilling of such well is not commenced within one hundred twenty (120) days after the last applicable election date, the effect shall be the same as if the proposal had not been made; however, the one hundred twenty (120) day period shall automatically be extended for an additional period, not to exceed sixty (60) days, as may be necessary, in order to obtain all applicable required regulatory permits, so long as applications for such required permits were properly filed within thirty (30) days after the last applicable election date.  Drilling operations shall be deemed to have commenced on the date rig charges begin according to the terms of the drilling contract.
 
20
10.2           Second Opportunity to Participate.  If fewer than all but one (1) or more Parties having a combined Working Interest of twenty (20%) or more elect to participate, the Operator shall inform the Parties of the elections made, whereupon any Party originally electing not to participate may then elect to participate by notifying the Operator within forty-eight (48) hours, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays, after receipt of such information.  This provision shall apply only in the event that there are three (3) or more Parties to this Agreement.
 
10.3           Final Election to Participate.  If fewer than all but one (1) or more Parties having a combined Working Interest of twenty (20%) or more approve any proposed  operation, the Operator, immediately after the expiration of the applicable response time, shall inform the Parties who have elected to participate of the total interest of the Parties approving such operation.  Each Participating Party, within forty-eight (48) hours (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays) after receipt of such notice, shall advise the Operator of its desire to (a) limit participation to such Party's working interest as shown on the proposed AFE; or (b) carry its proportionate part of Non-Participating Parties’ interests.  Failure to advise the proposing Party shall be deemed an election under (a), notwithstanding Section 9.4.  Should any Party elect to limit its participation to its interest as shown on the proposed AFE, the remaining Participating Parties shall carry the Non-Participating Parties' interests in such proportions as the remaining Participating Parties agree to by mutual consent.  In the event a drilling rig is on location, the time permitted for any response under this Article 10 shall not exceed a total of twenty-four (24) hours, inclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays.  This provision shall apply only in the event that there are three (3) or more Parties to this Agreement.


10.4           Operations by Fewer Than All Parties.  If fewer than all but one (1) or more Parties having a combined Working Interest of twenty percent (20%) or more elect to participate in and agree to bear all of the cost and risk of drilling the proposed well, Operator shall drill such well under this Agreement and the applicable provisions of Article 12 and the following special provisions shall apply:
 
 
(a)
If the well will be the first Exploratory Well drilled under this Agreement, then as of the last applicable election date, each Non-Participating Party shall be deemed to have relinquished to the Participating Parties, in proportion to their Participating Interests or in the proportions otherwise agreed by the Participating Parties, all of its interest in the Contract Area.  If such well is commenced within the time provided in Section 10.1 and is drilled as proposed in accordance with this Agreement, each Non-Participating Party shall execute an assignment of all of its interest in the Contract Area to the Participating Parties, in proportion to their Participating Interests or in the proportions otherwise agreed by the Participating Parties.
 
(b)
If the well will not be the first Exploratory Well drilled under this Agreement and if such well is commenced within the time provided in Section 10.1 and is drilled as proposed in accordance with this Agreement, then, all of the Non-Participating Party's(ies') operating rights and interests in production from such well shall be vested in the Participating Parties in proportion to their Participating Interest, whether or not any instrument evidencing a transfer of rights and interests has been delivered by the Non-Participating Party(ies).  The Participating Party(ies) shall have the right to recoup the costs applicable to such well as determined by Section 12.2 and/or Section 12.5 and the drilling of such well shall be governed by Article 12, except that the percentage of recoupment as provided in Section 12.2.1 (a) shall be eight hundred percent (800%) of the Non-Participating Party's Share of the cost of drilling the well.
 
If the well is not commenced within the time period provided in Section 10.1, the effect shall be as if the proposal had not been made.
 
21
10.5           Substitute Well.  If, prior to reaching the proposed depth or objective zone or zones to be tested for the Initial Exploratory Well or Exploratory Well as originally proposed, the Participating Party or Parties encounter mechanical difficulties, inpenetrable formation, and/or Gulf Coast conditions which render drilling impractical, then the Participating Party of Parties, or any of them, shall have the right, but not the obligation, to carry out the original proposed operation by drilling a Substitute Well.  Operations for the Substitute Well shall be commenced within sixty (60) days after the date the drilling operations cease on the well for which the Substitute Well is a substitute.  Operations for the Substitute Well shall be commenced as if it were the original proposed Initial Exploratory Well or Exploratory Well for which it is the substitute; and the relationship, rights and obligations as between the Participating Party and Non-Participating Party or Parties shall be the same as if the Substitute Well were, in fact, the proposed Initial Exploratory Well or Exploratory Well, as applicable.
 
22
10.6           Course of Action After Drilling to Initial Objective Depth.  At such time as an Exploratory Well has been drilled to the initial objective depth as proposed, or a mutually agreed upon lesser depth, and all approved logs, cores, and other tests have been completed, and the results thereof furnished to the Participating Parties, Operator shall notify the Participating Parties setting forth Operator's recommendation to either:
 
 
(a)
Conduct additional coring, testing, or logging of the formations encountered.  (If conflicting proposals are approved, the proposal receiving the largest percentage of Working Interest approval shall take precedence.  In the event of a tie between two or more approved proposals, the approved proposal first received by the Parties shall take precedence.)
 
(b)
Run casing and temporarily abandon the well for future completion.  (This election is not applicable for a well drilled from a Platform.)
 
(c)
Attempt completion, with a deeper completion having priority over a shallower completion attempt.  (If conflicting proposals for a single completion and a dual completion are approved, the proposal receiving the largest Working Interest shall take precedence.  Provided however, if the proposal taking precedence is a dual completion, then the dual must either include the zone approved for the single completion or provide for the completion in zones all of which are deeper than the zone approved for the single completion.)
 
(d)
Deepen the well.  (If conflicting proposals are approved, the operation proposed to the deepest depth shall take precedence.)
 
(e)
Sidetrack the well to another bottom hole location not deeper than the stratigrephic equivalent of the initial objective depth.
 
(f)
Perform other operations on the well. (If conflicting proposals are approved, the proposal receiving the largest percentage of Working Interest approval shall take precedence.  In the event of a tie between two or more approved proposals, the approved proposal first received by the Parties shall take precedence.)
 
(g)
Plug and abandon the well.
 
The Participating Parties, within twenty-four (24) hours, inclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal Holidays, after receipt of Operator's recommendation, shall respond thereto by either approving it or making another proposal.  If another proposal is made, the Participating Parties shall have an additional twenty-four (24) hours, inclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays, to respond thereto.  If conflicting proposals are made, the priority of operations shall be given first to (a) above and next to (b) above and so forth.  Failure of a Participating Party to respond to a proposal shall be deemed a negative response.
 
23
10.6.1
Operation by All Parties.  Subject to Section 10.6.4, if all Participating Parties approve a proposal, Operator shall conduct the operation at the Participating Parties’ cost and risk.
 
10.6.2
Operations by Fewer than All Parties.  If one (1) or more Parties having a combined Participating Interest in the well of twenty percent (20%) or more approve a proposal and agree to bear the cost, risk and liabilities (including loss of the hole due to deepening of any well) thereof, except a proposal to plug and abandon, Operator shall conduct the same as a Non-Consent Operation for such Parties pursuant to the provisions of Article 12, except that the percentage of recoupment as provided in Section 12.2.1(a) shall be the same as provided for in Section 10.4(b).  If no proposal receives the required approval, the well shall be plugged and abandoned at the expense of all Participating Parties unless any Participating Party notifies Operator within twenty-four (24) hours, inclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays, after the end of the last applicable election period that it desires to immediately assume all costs and risks including liabilities of further operations, in which event Operator shall, as promptly as possible, commence the proposed operation pursuant to the provisions of Article 12.  In the event there is more than one (1) Participating Party, each of which is willing to assume all costs, risks and liabilities of further operations, but each desires to perform a different operation, then the order of priority as listed above herein shall prevail and govern.
10.6.3
Obligations and Liabilities of Participating Parties.  If the decision is to complete at initial objective depth, to plug back and complete at a lesser depth, to deepen or to Sidetrack to another bottomhole location, a Party, by becoming a Non-Participating Party, shall be relieved of the obligations and liabilities as to such operation, except as to its share of the costs of plugging and abandoning that portion of the well in which it was a Participating Party.
 
10.6.4
Deepening or Sidetracking of Non-Consent Exploratory Well.  Subject to the terms of Section 10.6 above, if drilling to the initial objective depth does not result in a well which will be qualified as a Producible Well and the decision is to drill deeper or Sidetrack, each Non-Participating Party shall be notified by the Operator of such decision.  Any Non-Participating Party may then agree to participate in a deepening or Sidetracking operation by notifying the Operator, within forty-eight (48) hours, inclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays, after receiving notice of the decision.  In such event any Non-Participating Party which elects to participate in deepening or Sidetracking the well as proposed shall immediately pay to the Participating Parties its Participating Interest share of the costs of the well as if it had originally participated to the initial objective depth or that point the Sidetracking operation is commenced if lesser than the initial objective depth.  Thereafter such Non-Participating Party shall be deemed for all purposes to be a Participating Party as to such deepening or Sidetracking operations, and the provisions of Section 10.4 shall not be applicable to such Party as to the deepened or Sidetracked portion of the well.  The initial Participating Parties, however, shall continue to be entitled to recoup out of the proceeds received from production from the non-consent portion of the Non-Consent Well any balance remaining pursuant to the terms specified in Section 10.4 applicable to such Non-Consent Well, less the amount paid by a Non-Participating Party pursuant to this Section 10.6.4.
 
 
 
24
 
10.6.5
Plugging and Abandoning Cost.  The Participating Parties shall pay all costs of plugging and abandoning except any costs associated with a subsequent Non-Consent Operation.  The participants in a subsequent Non-Consent Operation shall pay any plugging and abandoning costs associated with such operation.  A Non-Consent Operation does not include the abandonment of the original wellbore above the depth at which the Non-Consent Operation commenced.

ARTICLE 11
DEVELOPMENT OPERATIONS

11.1           Operations by All Parties.  Any Party may propose Development Operations, including any wells (whether drilling, completing, recompleting, deepening, deviating or Sidetracking, plugging back or working over), Platform,  Facilities and/or Subsequent Facilities required by such operations, by submitting a Development Operation AFE to the other Parties for approval pursuant to the response to notice procedures set forth in Article 9.  If all Parties elect to participate in the proposed operation, Operator shall conduct such operation at their cost and risk.


11.2           Second Opportunity to Participate.  If fewer than all but one (1) or more Parties having a combined Working Interest of twenty percent (20%) or more elect to participate, the Operator shall inform the Parties of the elections made, whereupon any Party originally electing not to participate may then elect to participate by notifying the Operator within forty-eight (48) hours, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays.  This provision shall apply only in the event that there are three (3) or more Parties to this Agreement.
 
11.3           Final Election to Participate.  If fewer than all but one (1) or more Parties having a combined Working Interest of twenty percent (20%) or more approve any proposed operation, the Operator, immediately after the expiration of the applicable response time, shall inform the Parties who have elected to participate of the total interest of the Parties approving such operation.  Each Participating Party, within forty-eight (48) hours, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays, after receipt of such notice, shall advise the Operator of its desire to: (a) limit participation to such Party's interest as shown on the proposed AFE; or (b) carry its proportionate part of Non-Participating Parties interests.  Failure to advise the proposing Party shall be deemed an election under (a), notwithstanding Section 9.4.  Should any Party elect to limit its participation to its interest as shown on the proposed AFE, the remaining Participating Parties shall carry the Non-Participating Parties interest in such proportions as the remaining Participating Parties agree to by mutual consent.  In the event a drilling rig is on location, the time permitted for any response under this Article 11 shall not exceed a total of twenty-four (24) hours, inclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays.  This provision shall apply only in the event that there are three (3) or more Parties to this Agreement.
 
25
11.4           Operations by Fewer Than All Parties.  If fewer than all but one (1) or more Parties having a combined Working Interest of twenty percent (20%) or more elect to participate in and agree to bear all of the cost, risk and liability of a Development Operation, Operator shall conduct such operation pursuant to Article 12.
 
11.5           Timely Operations.  Development Operations shall be commenced within one hundred twenty (120) days following the date upon which the last applicable election may be made; however, the one hundred twenty (120) day period shall automatically be extended for an additional period, not to exceed sixty (60) days, as may be necessary, in order to obtain all applicable required regulatory permits so long as applications for such required permits were properly filed within thirty (30) days after the last applicable election date.  If no operations are commenced within such time period, the effect shall be as if the proposal had not been made.  Operations shall be deemed to have commenced: (a) on the date the contract for a new Platform is let, if the notice indicated a need for such Platform, or (b) on the date the rig charges begin according to the terms of the drilling contract.  For all other Development Operations, Development Operations shall be deemed to have commenced on the day charges are incurred pursuant to an approved AFE.


11.6           Substitute Well.  If, prior to reaching the proposed depth or objective zone or zones to be tested for the Development Operation as originally proposed, the Participating Party or Parties encounter mechanical difficulties, inpenetrable formation, and/or Gulf Coast conditions which render further drilling impossible, then the Participating Party of Parties, or any of them, shall have the right, but not the obligation, to carry out the original proposed operation by drilling a Substitute Well.  Operations for the Substitute Well shall be commenced within sixty (60) days after the date the drilling operations cease on the well for which the Substitute Well is a substitute.  Operations for the Substitute Well shall be commenced were the original proposed Development Operation for which it is the substitute, and the relationship, rights and obligations as between the Participating Party and Non-Participating Party or Parties shall be the same as if the Substitute Well were, in fact, the proposed Development Operation, as applicable.
 
26
11.7           Course of Action After Drilling to Initial Objective Depth.  At such time as a Development Well has been drilled to the initial objective depth as proposed and all approved logs, cores and other tests have been completed and the results thereof furnished to the Participating Parties, Operator shall notify the Participating Parties setting forth Operator's recommendation to either:
 
 
(a)
Conduct additional coring, testing, or logging of the formations encountered.  (If conflicting proposals are approved, the proposal receiving the largest percentage of Working Interest approval shall take precedence.  In the event of a tie between two or more approved proposals, the approved proposal first received by the Parties shall take precedence.)
 
(b)
Run casing and temporarily abandon the well for future completion.  (This election is not applicable for a well drilled from a Platform.)
 
(c)
Attempt completion, with a deeper completion having priority over a shallower completion attempt.  (If conflicting proposals for a single completion and a dual completion are approved, the proposal receiving the largest Working Interest shall take precedence.  Provided however, if the proposal taking precedence is a dual completion, then the dual must either include the zone approved for the single completion or provide for the completion in zones all of which are deeper than the zone approved for the single completion.)
 
(d)
Deepen the well.  (If conflicting proposals are approved, the operation proposed to the deepest depth shall take precedence.)
 
(e)
Sidetrack the well to another bottom hole location not deeper than the stratigraphic equivalent of the initial objective depth;
 
(f)
Perform other operations on the well.  (If conflicting proposals are approved, the proposal receiving the largest percentage of Working Interest approval shall take precedence.  In the event of a tie between two or more approved proposals, the approved proposal first received by the Parties shall take precedence.)
 
(g)
Plug and abandon the well.
 
The Participating Parties, within forty-eight (48) hours, inclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays, after receipt of Operator's recommendation, shall respond thereto by either approving it or making another proposal.  If another proposal is made, the Participating Parties shall have an additional twenty-four (24) hours to respond thereto.  If conflicting proposals are made, the priority of operations shall be given first to (a) above and next to (b) above and so forth.  Failure of a Participating Party to respond to a proposal shall be deemed a negative response.
 
27
11.7.1          Operations by All Parties.  If all Participating Parties approve a proposal, Operator shall conduct the operation at the Participating Parties' cost and risk.
 
11.7.2          Operations by Fewer than All Parties.  If fewer than all but one (1) or more Parties having a combined Participating Interest in the well of twenty percent (20%) or more approve a proposal and agree to bear the cost, risk, and liabilities (including loss of the hole due to deepening of any well) thereof, except a proposal to plug and abandon, Operator shall conduct the same as a Non-Consent Operation for such Parties pursuant to the provisions of Article 12.  If no proposal receives the required approval, the well shall be plugged and abandoned at the expense of all Participating Parties unless any Participating Party notifies Operator within twenty-four (24) hours after the end of the last applicable election period that it desires to immediately assume all costs and risks including liabilities of further operations, in which event Operator shall, as promptly as possible, commence the proposed operation pursuant to the provisions of Article 12.  In the event there is more than one (1) Party, each of which is willing to assume all costs, risks and liabilities of further operations, but each desires to perform a different operation, then the order of priority as listed above herein shall prevail and govern.
 
11.7.3          Obligations and Liabilities of Participating Parties.  If the decision is to complete at initial objective depth, to plug back and complete at a lesser depth, to deepen or to Sidetrack to another bottomhole location, a Party, by becoming a Non-Participating Party, shall be relieved of the obligations and liabilities as to such operation, except as to its share of the costs of plugging and abandoning that portion of the well in which it was a Participating Party.

11.8           Deeper Drilling.  If a well is proposed to be drilled below the deepest Producible Reservoir penetrated by a Producible Well, any Party may elect to participate either in the well as proposed or to the base of the deepest Producible Reservoir.  A Party electing to participate in such well to the base of said Producible Reservoir shall bear its proportionate part of the cost and risk of drilling to said Producible Reservoir including completion or abandonment. All operations below the depth to which such Party agreed to participate shall be governed by Article 12.  However, if the proposal to drill below the deepest Producible Reservoir penetrated by a Producible Well meets the requirements of an Exploratory Operation, the percentage of recoupment shall be that specified in Section 10.4(b) and shall be subject to the provisions of Article 10 with respect to such operations.
 
                11.9           Plugging and Abandoning Cost.  The Participating Parties shall pay all costs of plugging and abandoning except any costs associated with a subsequent Non-Consent Operation.  The participants in a subsequent Non-Consent Operation shall pay any plugging and abandoning costs associated with such operation.  A Non-Consent Operation does not include the abandonment of the original wellbore above the depth at which the Non-Consent Operation commenced.
 
28
                11.10         Subsequent Facilities.  The affirmative vote of one (1) or more Parties having a combined Participating Interest of fifty-one percent (51%) or more in the wells to be served by the proposed Subsequent Facilities shall constitute approval for the construction of such Subsequent Facilities and all Parties having an interest in the wells to be served shall be bound by such approval and be required to participate in the costs therefor.  Nothing hereunder shall limit a Party's rights under Section 21.1 to incur additional costs for separate facilities.
 
                11.11         Contracts.  Operator may enter into contracts with independent contractors for Development Operations and shall utilize competitive bidding.

ARTICLE 12
NON-CONSENT OPERATIONS

                12.1           Non-Consent Operations.  Operator shall conduct Non-Consent Operations at the sole risk, expense, and liability of the Participating Parties, in accordance with the following provisions:
 
12.1.1
Non-Interference.  Non-Consent Operations shall not interfere unreasonably with any other operations being conducted within the Contract Area.
 
12.1.2
Multiple Completion Limitation.  Non-Consent Operations shall not be conducted in a well having multiple completions unless: (a) each completion is owned by the same Parties participating in the Non-Consent Operations and in the same proportions; (b) the well is incapable of producing from any of its completions; or (c) all Participating Parties in the well consent to such operations.
12.1.3
Metering.  In Non-Consent Operations, production need not be separately metered, but subject to approval by appropriate governmental authority, may be determined on the basis of well tests.
 
12.1.4
Non-Consent Well.  Operations on a Non-Consent Well shall not be conducted in any Producible Reservoir penetrated by a Producible Well without written approval of each Non-Participating Party unless these four (4) conditions are satisfied: (a) such Producible Reservoir shall have been designated in the notice as an objective zone; (b) completion of such well in said Producible Reservoir will not increase the well density governmentally prescribed or approved for such Producible Reservoir; (c) the horizontal distance between the vertical projections of the midpoint of the Producible Reservoir in such well and any existing well in the same Producible Reservoir will be at least one thousand (1,000) feet if an oil-well completion or two thousand (2,000) feet if a gas-well completion; and (d) completion of such well as a producer will not cause or result in a decreased "MER" or "MPR" for any existing Producible Reservoir or Producible Well.  The terms "MER" and "MPR" are defined under 30 Code of Federal Regulations, Subpart K-Production rates, Parts 250.170 through 250.177.
 
 
 
29
 
 
12.1.5
Cost Information.  Operator shall, within one hundred twenty (120) days after completion of a Non-Consent Well, furnish the Parties an inventory and either a joint interest billing or an itemized statement of the cost of such well and equipment pertaining thereto.  Operator shall furnish to the Parties a quarterly statement showing operating expenses and the proceeds from the sale of production from the well for the preceding three (3) month period.  When Operator’s payout calculation indicates that payout has occurred, Operator shall promptly notify all Parties.
 
12.1.6
Completion.  For the purposes of determinations hereunder, each completion shall be considered a separate well.
 
12.2                         Forfeiture of Interest.  Upon commencement of Non-Consent Operations, each Non-Participating Party's leasehold operating rights in the Non-Consent Operation and title to production therefrom shall be owned by and vested in each Participating Party in proportion to its Participating Interest or in proportions agreed to by the Participating Parties for as long as the operations originally proposed are being conducted or production is obtained, subject to the following:
 
12.2.1
Production Reversion.  Such leasehold operating rights and title to production shall revert to each Non-Participating Party at 7:00 a.m. on the day following the date when the Participating Parties have recouped out of the Non-Participating Party's Share of the proceeds of production from such Non-Consent Operations an amount, which when added to any amounts received under Section 12.3, equals the sum of the following:

    (a) 
Six hundred percent (600%) of the Non-Participating Party's Share of the cost of drilling, testing, completing, recompleting, working over, deepening, deviating or Sidetracking, plugging back, or temporarily plugging and abandoning each Non-Consent Well (or any Non-Consent Operation(s) in a joint well), and equipping it through the wellhead connections, reduced by any contribution received under Article 20; plus
 
 
(b)
Three hundred percent (300%) of the Non-Participating Party's Share of the cost of any Non-Consent Facilities necessary to establish the production resulting from the operations defined in Section 12.2.1.(a) above; plus
 
(c)
Three hundred percent (300%) of the Non-Participating Party's Share of the cost of any Platform in which it does not participate and which must be installed to establish the production resulting from the operations defined in Section 12.2.1.(a) above; plus,
 
(d)
Three hundred percent (300%) of the Non-Participating Party's Share of the cost of using any existing Platform, whether or not owned by the Joint Account; plus,
 
(e)
Three hundred percent (300%) of the Non-Participating Party's Share of the cost of using any existing Facilities not owned by the Joint Account, including leased facilities; plus
 
(f)
One hundred percent (100%) of the Non-Participating Party's Share of gathering, treating, and operating expenses, royalties, and severance, production, and other similar taxes.
 
At 7:00 a.m. upon the day following the date of recoupment of such costs, a Non-Participating Party shall become a Participating Party in such operations.
 
30
12.2.2
Non-Production Reversion.  If such Non-Consent Operations fail to obtain production or if such operations result in production which ceases prior to recoupment by the Participating Parties of the penalties provided for above, such operating rights shall revert to each Non-Participating Party except that all wells (or portions thereof associated with any Non-Consent Operation(s) in a joint well), Platforms and Facilities of the Non-Consent Operations, as well as all liabilities and benefits related thereto, shall remain vested in the Participating Parties; however, any salvage in excess of the sum remaining under Section 12.2.1 shall be credited to all Parties.
 
 
12.3             Deepening or Sidetracking of Non-Consent Development Well.  If any Participating Party proposes to deepen or Sidetrack a Non-Consent Development Well, a Non-Participating Party may participate by notifying the Operator within thirty (30) days after receiving the proposal (forty-eight (48) hours, inclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays, if a rig is on location) that it will join in the deepening or Sidetracking operation and by paying to the Participating Parties; 1) if it is a deepening an amount equal to the costs of the well as if such Non-Participating Party had originally participated to the objective depth or; 2) if it is a sidetrack operation an amount equal to the Non-Participating Parties share of drilling the non-consent well to that point the Sidetracking operation is commenced.  The Participating Parties shall continue to be entitled to recoup the full sum specified in Section 12.2.1 applicable to the non-consent portion of the well out of the proceeds received from production from the non-consent portion of the well, less any amount received under this Section 12.3.


12.4           Operations from Non-Consent Platforms and Facilities.  Subject to the following, a Party which did not originally participate in a Platform or Facilities shall be a Non-Participating Party as to ownership therein and all operations thereon until the Participating Parties as to such Platform or Facilities have recouped the full sum specified in Section 12.2.1 applicable to such non-consent Platform or Facilities and the Non-Consent Operations which resulted in the setting of such Platform or Facilities and other Non-Consent Operations thereon or therefrom.  However, any original Non-Participating Party may participate in additional operations from such Platform or Facilities by notifying the Operator within thirty (30) days after receiving a proposal for operations from such Platform or Facilities that it will join in such proposed operations by paying to the Participating Parties in such Platform or Facilities an amount equal to the non-consent penalty provided for in Section 12.2.1 applicable to such Non-Participating Party’s Share of the actual cost of such Platform or Facilities, less any recoupment therefor previously obtained.  Thereafter, such original Non-Participating Party in such non-consent Platform or Facilities shall own its proportionate share thereof.  The Participating Parties in such non-consent Platform or Facilities shall continue to be entitled to recoup the full sum specified in Section 12.2.1 applicable to any other Non-Consent Operations thereon or therefrom.

12.5           Discovery or Extension from Mobile Drilling Operations.  If a Non-Consent Well is drilled from a mobile drilling rig or floating drilling vessel and results in the discovery of oil or gas or extension of a Producible Reservoir and, if within one (1) year from the date the drilling equipment is released, a Platform or other fixed structure is ordered and if its location is within three thousand (3,000) feet from the vertical projection of the bottom-hole location of any such well (unless limited by surface restrictions or seabed conditions), the recoupment of costs applicable to such well shall be governed by Section 12.2 and shall be recovered by the Participating Parties in the following manner:
 
 
(a)
If such Non-Consent Well is not completed and produced, recoupment shall be out of one-half (1/2) of the Non-Participating Party's Share of production from all subsequently completed wells on the Contract Area which are completed in the Producible Reservoir discovered or extended by such Non-Consent Well and in which the Non-Participating Party in such Non-Consent Well has a Participating Interest.
 
(b)
If such Non-Consent Well is completed and produced, recoupment shall be out of the Non-Participating Party's Share of all production from such Non-Consent Well and one-half (1/2) of the Non-Participating Party's Share of production from all subsequently completed wells on the Contract Area which are completed in the Producible Reservoir discovered or extended by such Non-Consent Well and in which the Non-Participating Party in such Non-Consent Well has a Participating Interest.
 
        12.6           Non-Consent Operations to Maintain Lease.  Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if a Lease has no wells thereon capable of commercial production in the final six (6) months of the primary term of such Lease and such Lease is not held by a unit or a Suspension of Production pursuant to other operations on the Lease or in the unit, any Party electing not to participate in the drilling of a well or other operation in the final six (6) months of the primary term or at any time during the secondary term, shall assign its full interest in such Lease pro-rata to the Parties hereto undertaking the drilling of such well or participating in such operation.  Such assignment shall be executed and delivered within thirty (30) days after commencement of the well or operation.  If at any time after the expiration of the primary term of a Lease, a well must be drilled or an operation conducted because of cessation of production or to fulfill an obligation to develop such Lease, such well or operation being required to extend the term of such Lease or a portion thereof, any Party electing not to participate in the operation or the drilling of such a well shall assign its full interest in that Lease, or portion thereof, pro-rata to the Parties hereto undertaking the drilling of such a well.  Such assignment shall be executed and delivered within thirty (30) days after commencement of the well or operation, but shall be limited to the portion of the Lease the term of which was extended by the operation or drilling the well, and provided any Non-Participating Party shall retain its rights and liabilities with respect to any previously completed wells on that Lease and the production therefrom.  Thereafter, that Lease shall no longer be a part of the Contract Area, and the Non-Participating Party or Parties shall no longer own an interest in any wells drilled on such Lease, other than those wells drilled prior to the occurrence set out herein.  Should the Parties electing to undertake the drilling of a well or conduct operations under this Section 12.6 fail to perform, as Participating Parties, the drilling of the well or operations substantially as proposed, the Parties receiving the aforementioned assignment shall assign back to the Party or Parties originally electing not to participate, that interest which was caused to be assigned pursuant to this Section 12.6.  A Party hereunder executing an assignment of its interest in a Lease pursuant to the foregoing shall not be relieved of any obligation hereunder accruing prior to such assignment.  If more than one (1) well is drilled or more than one (1) operation conducted, any of which would maintain or extend such Lease or such portions thereof, an assignment shall not be required from any Party participating in any such well(s) or operation(s) as to that portion of the Lease or unit which would have been maintained by such well(s) or operation(s).

12.7          Allocation of Platform Costs to Non-Consent Operations.  Non-Consent Operations shall be subject to further conditions as follows:
 
12.7.1
Charges.  If a Non-Consent Well is drilled from a Platform, the Participating Parties in such well shall be liable to the Joint Account owners of the Platform for the use of the Platform and its Facilities as follows:
 
 
(a)
Such Participating Parties shall pay a sum equal to that portion of the total cost of the Platform which one (1) Platform slot bears to the total number of slots on the Platform.  If the Non-Consent Well is abandoned, the right of Participating Parties to use that Platform slot shall terminate, unless such Parties commence drilling a substitute well from the same slot within ninety (90) days after abandonment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Non-Consent Well is abandoned as an unsuccessful well, and no substitute well is drilled by the Participating Parties, then, if the slot is abandoned in a condition such that it could be used for the drilling of a future well, the Participating Parties shall not be required to pay the sum set out in this Section 12.7.1.
 
(b)
If the Non-Consent Well production is handled through the Facilities, the Participating Parties shall pay a sum equal to that portion of the total cost of such Facilities, less accumulated depreciation, which one (1) well completion bears to the total number of Producible Well completions utilizing the Facilities.
 
 
 
 
33
 
12.7.2
Operating and Maintenance Charges.  The Participating Parties shall pay on a monthly basis all costs necessary to connect a Non-Consent Well to the Facilities and that proportionate part of the expense of operating and maintaining the Platform and Facilities applicable to the Non-Consent Well.  Platform and Facilities operating and maintenance expenses shall be allocated in proportion to the producing well count during a calendar month as it relates to the total number of wells producing from such Platform during such calendar month.  For the purpose of this provision, a producing zone or each completion in a multi-completed well shall be considered as a separate well.
 
12.7.3
Payments.  Payment of sums pursuant to Section 12.7.1 is not a purchase of an additional interest in the Platform or Facilities.  Such payments, if the recoupment provisions of Section 12.2 are applicable, shall be included in the total amount which the Participating Parties are entitled to recoup out of production from the Non-Consent Well.
 
12.8        Allocation of Costs Between Depths (Single Completion).  For the purpose of allocating costs on any well with a single completion in which the Participating Interests of the Parties are not the same for the entire depth or the completion thereof, the cost of drilling, completing, equipping, and plugging and abandoning such well shall be allocated on the following basis:
       
    (a)      Intangible drilling, completion, casing string, and material costs from the surface to a depth one hundred feet (100') below the base of the Producible Reservoir in which the well is completed shall be charged to the Participating Parties in such completion in accordance with their respective Participating Interest.
 
(b)
Intangible drilling, completion, casing string, and material costs, other than tubing costs, from a depth of one hundred feet (100') below the base of the Producible Reservoir in which the well is completed to total depth shall be charged to the Participating Parties in the well to total depth in accordance with their respective Participating Interest.
 
(c)
All plugging and abandonment costs directly associated with the Producible Reservoir in which the well is completed will be allocated to the Participating Parties in that completion in accordance with their respective Participating Interests.  All final plugging and abandonment costs associated with the wellbore will be allocated proportionately among all Participating Parties in the well.
 
 
 
34
 
 
12.9        Allocation of Costs Between Depths (Multiple Completions).  For the purpose of allocating costs on any well completed in dual or multiple Producible Reservoirs in which the Participating Interests of the Parties are not the same for the entire depth or the completion thereof, the cost of drilling, completing, equipping, and plugging and abandoning such well shall be allocated on the following basis:
 
 
(a)
Intangible drilling, completion, casing string, and material costs other than tubing costs, from the surface to a depth one hundred feet (100') below the base of the upper completed Producible Reservoir shall be divided equally between the completed Producible Reservoirs and charged to the Participating Parties in each Producible Reservoir in accordance with their respective Participating Interest.
 
(b)
Intangible drilling, completion, casing string, and material costs, other than tubing, from a depth one hundred feet (100') below the base of the upper completed Producible Reservoir to a depth one hundred feet (100') below the base of the second completed Producible Reservoir shall be divided equally between the second and any other Producible Reservoir completed below such depth and charged to the Participating Parties in each such Producible Reservoir in accordance with their respective Participating Interest.  If the well is completed in additional Producible Reservoirs, the costs applicable to each such Producible Reservoir shall be determined and charged to the Participating Parties in the same manner as prescribed for wells completed in dual Producible Reservoirs.
 
(c)
Intangible drilling, completion, casing string, and material costs, other than tubing costs, from a depth one hundred feet (100') below the base of the lowest completed Producible Reservoir to total depth shall be charged to the Participating Parties in the well to total depth in accordance with their respective Participating Interest.
 
(d)
Costs of tubing strings serving each separate Producible Reservoir shall be charged to the Participating Parties in each Producible Reservoir in accordance with their respective Participating Interest.
 
(e)
For the purposes of allocating tangible and intangible costs between Producible Reservoirs that occur at less than one hundred feet (100') intervals, the distance between the base of the upper reservoir to the top of the next lower reservoir shall be allocated equally between reservoirs.
