Banner shall connect onto its Gathering System and accept delivery of crude oil at mutually acceptable connection points for each lease, well or facility identified on Exhibit A
attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference. All such crude oil shall be transported in the Gathering System pursuant to CLR instructions at either a delivery point at Banners Albin Station and delivered into Plains Pipeline L.P.
facilities at Lone Tree, Montana or a delivery point at Banners Vaira Station and delivered into Bridger Pipeline Companys pipeline for the account of CLR.

delivered into Bridger Pipeline Companys facilities at Vaira Station. Payment by CLR shall be made in response to detailed invoices from Banner which may be sent no more frequently than once per month. 
 


LINE LOSS:

The price agreed to be paid above includes compensation for any and all line loss that may be experienced in the gathering or transporting of the crude oil contemplated herein. In no event will
additional charges be made to CLR to compensate Banner for line loss regardless of how described or classified.   


LINE FILL:

CLR agrees to provide its pro rata share of barrels of crude oil for line fill required for operation of the Gathering System. Such line fill may be withdrawn from the Gathering System within
(30) days after termination of this agreement.  B. NON-PIPELINE/TRUCKED TRANSPORTATION: 
 


SERVICE:

Banner hereby agrees to unload and accept into its facilities at its Albin Station or Vaira Station as designated by CLR for CLRs account crude oil from the leases, wells or facilities
identified or listed on Exhibit B attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference. It is anticipated that all such crude oil shall be transported by means other than through the Gathering System to either Albin Station or Vaira
Station.   


QUANTITY:

Crude oil volumes made subject to this agreement for non-pipeline delivered crude oil include but are not limited to production from the list of leases, wells and properties attached hereto as
Exhibit B.   


PRICE:

CLR shall pay to Banner an amount equal to $0.10/barrel of crude oil delivered for its account to Albin Station or Vaira Station by non-pipeline means. Payment by CLR shall be made in response
to detailed invoices from Banner which may be sent no more frequently than once per month.  C. ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS:
  


TERM:

The term of this Agreement (the Term) shall commence on July 1, 2007, and shall continue month to month until terminated. This Agreement is terminable by either party upon
thirty (30) days written notice delivered pursuant to the contact information provided below.   


INDEMNITIES:

Banner shall be liable to and indemnify, defend and hold CLR, its affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and consultants, harmless from and against any and all
claims, demands, causes of action, losses and penalties (including, without limitation, attorneys fees) in any way related to the design, construction, operation, maintenance, ownership, repair, disconnection and removal of the Gathering
System or other facilities relating thereto or the Albin Station, Vaira Station, or its truck unloading facilities (including, without limitation, all environmental liability), except, and to the extent that, such claims, demands, causes of action,
losses and penalties are resulting from or attributable to CLRs gross negligence or willful misconduct. This provision shall survive termination of this agreement. 
 


 EXPANSION OF SCOPE: 
The parties recognize that the list of properties attached hereto and covered hereby may change as CLRs regional business expands. The list of properties covered hereby may be expanded,
altered or amended by written consent executed by the parties.   


AUDIT RIGHTS:

Each party shall have the right at all reasonable times, upon written request, to audit all records of the other party pertinent to this agreement to verify such partys compliance with the
terms and conditions of this agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall be entitled to protect the confidentiality of all information it considers proprietary. If any audit conducted pursuant to this section reveals that there was an
inaccuracy or omission in the invoices submitted under this agreement, the parties shall, within ten (10) days of a request by either party therefore, meet to discuss the adjustments and/or payments that would be necessary to correct such
inaccuracy or omission; provided, however, that no adjustments and/or payment shall be made with respect to any inaccuracy or omission first alleged after the second anniversary of the date of the invoice containing such inaccuracy or omission.
  


NOTICES:

Any notice to be given under this agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given to the party to whom it is addressed on the date presented in person or 3 days following
the date of mailing if sent by prepaid first class mail or, if delivered via facsimile transmission, 4 hours following the time of transmission of such facsimile provided such deemed receipt is within normal business hours of the recipient party,
failing which such notice will be deemed to have been received at the commencement of the next following business day. Any notice to be given shall be given in accordance with the following particulars or such other particulars of which a party
