COULTER LIMITED PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT
 
This Coulter Limited Participation Agreement ("Agreement") is made and entered into as of January 10th, 2012, by and between La Sal Energy, LLC, a Texas limited liability company ("La Sal"), and Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc., a Nevada corporation ("Torchlight"). La Sal and Torchlight are hereinafter referred to collectively as "Parties" and individually as a "Party".
 
WHEREAS, La Sal is the owner of (i) a One Hundred Percent (100%) Working Interest and a Seventy-Five Percent (75%) Net Revenue Interest (the "La Sal Interest") in and to those certain Oil, Gas and Mineral Leases attached as "Exhibit A" hereto (collectively, the "Lease") upon which the following well exists: John Coulter #1-R drilled to 11,406 TD (the "Well"); and
 
WHEREAS, the Parties desire to set forth the terms and conditions pursuant to which Torchlight can acquire an interest in the Well;
 
Now THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual benefits and obligations hereunder, the Parties agree as follows:
 
1.             Definitions :
 
1.1           "Closing" means the later of the date on which La Sal and Torchlight sign this Agreement or Torchlight initiates a wire transfer to La Sal's account in the amount of the Purchase Price defined in Paragraph 2.1 below, which transfer shall initiate no later than 2 days after signature of this Agreement.
 
1.2           "Production" means completion of operations on the Well resulting in first gas sold following Closing.
 
2.             Closing Obligations; Torchlight Options:
 
2.1           At Closing, Torchlight will pay La Sal $350,000.00 (the "Purchase Price") by cashier's check.
 
2.2           In exchange for the Purchase Price, La Sal will assign and convey to Torchlight a Thirty-Four Percent (34%) Working Interest and a Thirty-Four Percent (34%) Net Revenue Interest in the La Sal Interest in the Well pursuant to an Assignment of Oil and Gas Interests and Bill of Sale ("Assignment") substantially in the form attached hereto as "Exhibit B".

2.3          Torchlight Option No. 1. At Closing and thereafter, Torchlight may pay up to an additional $75,000 in 3 tranches ("Option") in exchange for La Sal's assignment and conveyance to Torchlight of up to an additional Six Percent (6%) interest in the La Sal Interest in the Wells pursuant to an Assignment(s): (i) $15,000 paid at Closing as a deposit towards acquisition of an additional Two Percent (2%) interest ("Option 1"); (ii) $25,000 paid within 45 days after Closing for an additional Two Percent (2%) interest ("Option 2"); and (iii) $35,000 paid within 75 days after Closing for a final additional Two Percent (2%) interest and to complete acquisition of the initial additional Two Percent (2%) interest ("Option 3"). If any Option payment deadline is missed, Torchlight may not exercise its Option with respect to any remaining 2% tranches. If Torchlight declines to exercise Option 2 or Option 3, then Torchlight shall either pay to La Sal within three (3) days thereafter the remaining $10,000 to complete Option 1, or La Sal shall return to Torchlight the $15,000 deposit to Torchlight. Torchlight shall not acquire any additional Two Percent (2%) interests until a tranche is paid for in full. For example, until the entire $25,000 is paid by Torchlight for Option 1, La Sal shall remain the owner of the Two Percent interest associated with Option1 and shall be entitled to all benefits and revenue therefrom. The first revenue paid with respect to any Two Percent (2%) interest after acquisition by Torchlight shall be apportioned pro rata between the Parties based on the length of ownership during that revenue period. Any amount of the $75,000 that Torchlight may pay to La Sal is for La Sal's sole benefit and is not for use in the Wells' operations unless La Sal in its sole discretion so decides.
 
2.4          Torchlight Option No. 2. Torchlight also may purchase up to an additional Five Percent (5%) interest in the La Sal Interest in the Wells pursuant to an Assignment(s) in full percentage points at $10,000 per point, the total number of full percentage points times $10,000 per point totaling the "Purchase Price". Torchlight must exercise this option to purchase within 30 days from the first date of Production by notifying La Sal in writing of the number of points, if any, Torchlight will acquire and by paying La Sal (i) fifty percent of the Purchase Price within thirty (30) days and (ii) the remaining fifty percent of the Purchase Price within 60 days from election.
 
La Sal has right to keep the points, or sell the points in full or part to a third party, if Torchlight has not made its election in writing to La Sal within the 30 days and paid as described above. La Sal will assign and convey percentage points purchased by Torchlight pursuant to an Assignment pro rata in accordance with each fifty percent payment. Until receipt of payment, however, La Sal shall remain the owner of the additional full percentage points and shall be entitled to all benefits and revenue therefrom.

2.5           The rights granted by La Sal to Torchlight pursuant to the terms hereof are without warranty, either express or implied. Upon request, La Sal will furnish to Torchlight, at Torchlight's cost, such abstracts or evidence of title as it has in its files, but there shall be no obligation on the part of La Sal to purchase new or supplemental abstracts or to do any curative work in connection with title to the Well or the Lease. Any Assignment shall be subject to the reservations, obligations to reassign, depth limitations and other terms and provisions set forth in this Agreement. Torchlight acknowledges that it has completed and is satisfied with its due diligence review of the Well and has no reservations with respect to the same and that due diligence is not a condition precedent to the Closing.
 
3.          Performance Obligations:
 
3.1           Operator Position. Evergreen Energy, Inc. is the current Operator. La Sal will at all times have sole authority to appoint the Operator under the Joint Operating Agreement (" JOA" ), and all JOAs will include a provision to this effect.
 
3.2           Drilling and Costs. Upon Closing, the Parties will cause the Operator to frac the John Coulter #1-R well. The Parties anticipate that the initial Purchase Price will fund the fracing, but if there is a shortfall, the Parties shall pay for additional costs out of pocket in accordance with their actual percentage interests in the Well.
 
4.          Additional Deliveries at Closing.
 
4.1           Each Party shall deliver at Closing certified resolutions of its Board of Directors approving this Agreement.
 
4.2           All of the Parties shall execute, acknowledge, and deliver or cause to be executed, acknowledged and delivered such instruments and take such other actions as may be necessary or advisable to carry out their obligations under this Agreement and under any document, certificate, or other instrument delivered pursuant hereto.
 
5.          Revenue and Expense Sharing.
 
5.1           Upon Production, the net revenue split shall be 80% to Torchlight and 20% to La Sal until net revenue is an accumulated $437,500.
 
5.2           While net revenue split is 80%/20%, expenses above the $350,000 initiall paid in shall be split according to actual percentage interests in the Well.

6.            Remedies on Default.
 
6.1          If Closing does not occur on or before January 16, 2012, then this Agreement shall be null and void and neither Party shall be liable to the other for failure to close.
