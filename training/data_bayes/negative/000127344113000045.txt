CLAUSE 13 - DETERMINATION OF QUANTITIES AND QUALITY13.1Measurement Equipment and regulations applicable13.1.1The quantity and quality measurements and the samples of Hydrocarbons Delivered or Withdrawn will be done by the Transporter or by whomever it appoints through the static or dynamic measurement systems that are installed at the Entry Node and at the Exit Node. Each measurement system installed can include, among other things: 13.1.2Calibration unit (Prover) installed and calibrated according to the “water – draw” method (water distillation) as per the specifications of the API MPMS – 4 Manual “Petroleum Measurement Standard”, Chapter 4 “Proving Systems” in its most recent edition. 13.1.3Positive displacement or Coriolis – type Turbine meters, installed according to the API MPMS – 4 Manual “Petroleum Measurement Standard”, Chapter 6 “Metering Assemblies Standards” in its most recent edition. The factors of the meters will be derived by calibration, utilizing the same standards, taking into account the correction by temperature and pressure. 13.1.4A device for the ongoing taking of samples as per the specifications of the PI MPMS – 4 Manual “Petroleum Measurement Standard”, Chapter 8 “Sampling” in its most recent edition. The methods to be utilized to determine the characteristics of the samples are as follows: ▪Water (by distillation) ASTM D 4006▪Water by Karl Fisher ASTM D 4377▪Salt Contents ASTM D 3230▪Sediments (by extraction) ASTM D 473▪API Density 1298▪Sulphur ASTM D 429413.1.5Also, a BS&W equipment may be available, by the centrifuge method, following, for that case, the ASRM D 4007 test method. The density of the Samples will DC – Contrato de Transporte de Crude Oil – 017 – 2013    58be determined in the event of damage of the densitometer or to validate or calibrate the samples of the densitometer. 13.1.6A densitometer for the permanent measurement of density. 13.1.7A flow – measuring electronic system adjusted to the requirements of API MPMS Chapter 21.2, in its last edition. 13.1.8The volumetric correction factor that must be applied will be the one that appears in the last edition of tables 23 and 24 of the ASTM 1250 method. 13.1.9The liquidation of the measurements, dynamic or static, will be made according to the API standard in force, chapter 12 or 14, as corresponds. 13.1.10The Transporter will give back to the Sender, measured in the Exit Nodes specified by the Sender, a volume of Crude Oil equivalent to the volume delivered by the Sender and measured in the Entry Nodes, with the following adjustments: 13.1.11Deduction by Identifiable Losses and No – Identifiable Losses. The Identifiable Losses and No – Identifiable Losses will be distributed among the Senders according to the provisions of Clause 20 of this Manual. 13.1.12Increases or Reductions that it is necessary to make as a result of making the Volumetric Compensation adjustments. 13.2Accounting by losses: The volume of all the losses of Crude Oil that occur in the pipeline will be figured out by the Transporter according to the Prudent Practices of the Industry. 13.3Process of Determination of Quantities and Quality at the Entry and Exit Points: 13.3.1The quantity measurements and the quality sampling of the Deliveries and Withdrawals (including the calibration of the instruments) will be the responsibility of the Transporter and will be made according to the standards ad the prevailing practices accepted by the API and the ASTM. The equipment installed for the measurement and sampling will be determined by the Transporter. 13.3.2The Transporter will ensure that there are adequate measuring and calibration procedures in place in the Entry Nodes as well as in the Exit nodes. The calibration of the measuring systems will be made according to the Prudent DC – Contrato de Transporte de Crude Oil – 017 – 2013    59Practices of the Industry. The calibration factor of the meters will be effective only as from the date of the last calibration, excepting in case of manifest error, in which case the last valid calibration factor will be applied. 13.3.3The Transporter has the responsibility to rake Crude Oil samples that are representative according to the API Standards and with the adequate volume per each Delivery and each Withdrawal made. The frequency of said sampling will be occasionally determined by the Transporter based on the continuity of the quality of the Crude oil, among other factors. The samples will be utilized for the following purposes: (i) to determine the quality of each Delivery or Withholding, and (ii) as counter – sample that the Transporter will preserve for a period of no more than thirty (30) days for the transfer of custody at the Point of Entry and / or Exit Point of the Pipelines other than the export ports. In these, the preservation period will be governed by the provisions of the Technical Rules of Operation of he respective port and it will be considered up to ninety (90) days. The counter – sample will be preserved for the case in which there is any claim regarding a specific Delivery or Withdrawal. 13.3.4The volumes of Crude Oil that the Transporter commits to transport will be determined using the Pipeline’s measurement systems, following the API and ASTM standards. The Transporter will assure the filling of the official forms that it has for each measurement modality, which will contain the following information, at least: the date, the reading of the meters or the measures of the storage tank or tanks, before the start and after the end of the Deliveries and Withdrawals, the API Gravity, densities, temperatures, pressures, sediment and water percentages and any other characteristic necessary for its identification. The forms mentioned above are documents that will be used to make the calculation of the amount of the transportation and the volumetric compensation adjustment, and will be useful as evidencing documents for any other purpose. 13.3.5At any moment before the start of any Delivery or Withdrawal and in intervals with a frequency not greater than twice (2) a month, the Sender can inspect, through an independent inspector, and with the Transporter’s approval, the accuracy of the results and of the measurement and the sampling made to determine the quantity and quality of the Hydrocarbon. The cost of said inspection is on the Sender’s account. For this purpose, the respective Sender must notify the name and the position of the independent inspector to the Transporter at least five (5) business days before the relevant measurement of the Crude oil. 13.3.6The Calibration of the measurement equipment must be made when the operational circumstances so require, by written request received from a DC – Contrato de Transporte de Crude Oil – 017 – 2013    60particular sender and according to the calibration and verification program established by the Transporter. Every time this procedure is made, the factors of the meters will be updated. Before the calibration of the Meters, the Transporter will notify the Senders about the dates in which said calibration will take place, so the same may, if they deem it as necessary, attend the calibration. The meters’ calibration factor will be effective only as from the date of the last calibration, and minutes will be signed by the parties that took part in the calibration or, if this is not possible, it will be documented in a letter of the Transporter to the Senders. 13.3.7According to the API recommendations, the provers will be re – calibrated at least once every five years (as from the date of the last calibration) or immediately after any alteration n the measuring section. 13.3.8The volumes of Hydrocarbons that the Transporter accepts and schedules for transportation will be determined by meters installed in the Entry and / or Exit Nodes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Transporter may utilize alternate methods included in the API Standards. If a static measurement of tanks is used, these must have their volume approved by the Ministry of Mines and Energy or competent entity. The measurement of tanks will be determined following the standards in force for such purposes. CLAUSE 14 - VOLUMETRIC COMPENSATION FOR QUALITY14.1The Rules for the Volumetric Compensation for Quality is an integral part of this Manual as Attachment 2 (QUALITY COMPENSATION MECHANISMS FOR THE BLEND OF CRUDE OILS). 14.2The adjustments in the volume of the hydrocarbon pursuant to the Volumetric Compensation for Quality will not affect the amount payable for the Transportation Service, which will be figured out on the gross volumes actually delivered less the losses that are not in the charge of the Sender under the Manual or under the respective Transportation Contract. 14.3With a monthly periodicity, in the third week of the Calendar Month after the Month of Operation, the Volumetric Compensation for Quality will be made.14.4Principles of the Volumetric Compensation for Quality14.4.1Each one of the senders will deliver to the Transporter, at a Point of Entry, a volume of hydrocarbons which, and only for Volumetric Compensation for DC – Contrato de Transporte de Crude Oil – 017 – 2013    61Quality (CVC) purposes, will be assessed according with it particular quality. This quality will be determined by an independent quantity and quality inspector. 14.4.2Considering that because of the transportation the Hydrocarbons Delivered in the Pipeline get mixed, each Sender will receive at the Exit Point a volume of Hydrocarbon with a quality other than that of its Hydrocarbon delivered, excepting when it has requested and it has accepted the transportation of the Hydrocarbon in a segregated manner. The quality of this segregated hydrocarbon will also be determined by an independent quantity and quality inspector. This Hydrocarbon will be assessed only for purposes of Volumetric Compensation by Quality and it will consider the quality compensation because of the interfaces that occur when the same are transported with other Crude Oils. 14.4.3The Transporter will apply the mechanism of Volumetric Compensation for Quality for the Pipeline, which will have the following main characteristics: 14.4.4The Senders who Delivered to the Transporter Hydrocarbons with a quality higher than that of the blended Hydrocarbon Withdrawn at the Pipeline’s Exit Point, will have the right to a volume compensation equivalent to the one that have to be assumed by the Senders who delivered Hydrocarbon of a lower quality than the one Withdrawn by them at the Exit Point. 14.4.5The Volumetric Compensation for Quality will be internal between the Senders in a way that the final volumetric balances are equal to zero and the Transporter will not charge or pay any volume for this and it will only be the mediator, regulator, liquidator and responsible for the volumetric distribution of the compensations. 14.4.6The Volumetric Compensation for Quality is not part of the Transportation Fee and therefore it cannot be compensated and it will have no variation whatsoever for this reason. 14.4.7In each month of operation the Transporter will make a balance of the volumes and qualities existing at the beginning of the month, Delivered to the Pipeline, lost, withdrawn, and existing at the end of the Month, both for the total Hydrocarbons and for the individual hydrocarbons of each sender. 14.5Indemnity: The Sender will indemnify, release and hold the Transporter harmless for any cost, action, claim, procedures brought by third parties, losses and all the damages and obligations incurred inherent in the mix of hydrocarbons in the transportation process and of the Volumetric Compensation for Quality. DC – Contrato de Transporte de Crude Oil – 017 – 2013    6214.6Amendments: In any case, the Volumetric Compensation for Quality mechanism herein included, in the respective annexes and other documents related to the CVC may be amended by the Transporter, with the prior agreement of the Senders. 14.7The Senders of a given Hydrocarbon may agree with the Transporter that the CVC is not applied to said hydrocarbon. The foregoing will be applicable provided that the Hydrocarbon of other Senders that do not take part in said agreement is not affected, and that there is full consensus between the senders that take part in the mix. 14.8By agreement of all the Senders and the Transporter, it will be possible to opt for not implementing the CVC process for the crude oils transported through the pipeline. In this case the transporter may implement any other mechanism validated with the Senders to make the volumetric balances. CLAUSE 15 - PIPELINE TRANSPORTATION BULLETIN – BTO The Transporter will implement the Pipeline Transportation Bulletin – BTO that will contain, as a minimum, the following information: 15.1Public Access Data: 15.1.1General Description of the Pipeline15.1.2Transportation Fees in force for each Segment15.1.3Tables of values or formulas for the calculation of the Monetary Conditions in force15.1.4Pipeline’s Design Capacity and Nominal Capacity15.1.5Monthly available capacity estimated for the next six (6) months, and annual for the next five (5) years15.1.6Sections of this Manual that correspond to the connection requests, Nomination process and minimum Hydrocarbon’s Quality requirements. 15.2Information of Exclusive Access for the Senders and Third Parties:15.2.1This ManualDC – Contrato de Transporte de Crude Oil – 017 – 2013    6315.2.2Discussion about amendments of the Manual15.2.3General information of the timetable of the Pipeline’s scheduled maintenance and of other scheduled activities that affect the Effective Capacity during the next six (6) months.15.2.4List of the Expansion projects and changes in the Pipeline’s infrastructure. 15.2.5Effective Capacity, confirmed for the Operation Month and estimated for the next five (5) months, and the corresponding Firm Available Capacity for each Segment. 15.2.6Transportation Program for the Month of Operation and tentative for the next five (5) months. 15.2.7Description of the mechanism established by the Transporter and set forth in the nomination process to assign, in an equitable manner, the Firm Capacity Available. 15.2.8The last volumetric balance made for the Pipeline15.2.9Daily statistics for the last Month of Operation and monthly ones since the date of enforceability of Resolution 18 – 1258 of 2010 of the Ministry of Mines and Energy, about the information on Effective Capacity and Volumetric Balances. 15.2.10The annual Transportation Fees and the Monetary Conditions for each stretch from the date of validity of Resolution 18 – 1258 of 2010 of the Ministry of Mines and Energy. 15.3The transporter will not have the obligation to publish the information of a reserved nature. 15.4The Transporter will give to the Senders and Third Parties interested in transporting Hydrocarbons through the Pipeline that so request it, within ten (10) days after the request and with the prior verification of the Transporter of their capacity as Sender or Third Party, a password for the access to the exclusive information the subject of item 15.3 of this Clause.

The Sender will pay the Transporter the costs incurred in the analysis and eventual treatment of this Hydrocarbon to bring it to the specifications required or to implement the scheme required for its transportation. 16.6The Transporter, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith, will have the right to suggest any change of the minimum Quality specifications of the Hydrocarbon from time to time, according to the Operational Practices, that may be necessary or adequate, including, but not limited to, to prevent material DC – Contrato de Transporte de Crude Oil – 017 – 2013    65damages or the material degradation of the Effective Capacity of the Pipeline, to prevent personal damages or damages to the property or to the environment. Any change of specification must be subject to an express written agreement of the Parties. 16.7The Hydrocarbon delivered by each Sender and transported through the Pipeline may vary in its quality due to the blend with other types of hydrocarbons. Excepting for the events in which Segregated Crude Oil is transported, the Transporter will not have any obligation whatsoever to give back, at the Exit Point, Hydrocarbons of the same Quality of the Hydrocarbons Delivered for its transportation at the Point of Entry. The Blend Crude Oils transported will have the adjustments regarding Volumetric Compensation for Quality applied to them. 16.8In the transportation of Blend Crude Oils and of Segregated Crude Oil, pollution fronts are generated. All the Senders of the Pipeline must accept as withdrawn volume part of the pollution fronts generated in the transportation through Pipeline. 16.9The Transporter commits to hand back to the Sender, and the latter agrees, on its part, to Withdraw at an Exit Point, the equivalent volume of Hydrocarbon, once the mechanism of the Volumetric Compensation for Quality has been applied. CLAUSE 17 - RULES FOR THE TRANSPORTATION OF SEGREGATED HYDROCARBON17.1Upon request of a Sender, the Transporter may opt for accepting the transportation of Segregated hydrocarbon, provided that it is an alternative that is technically and economically viable. The transportation of segregated Hydrocarbon cannot change the scheme established in Clause 10 and it will be made following the provisions of this manual. 17.2As a consequence of the foregoing, the Transporter will inform the Senders of its availability to start the transportation of segregated Hydrocarbon. The transportation of segregated Hydrocarbon will be subject to the Nomination process established in this Manual. 17.3The additional charges for the transportation of the segregated hydrocarbon will be on the charge of the Sender or Third Party that requests this service. 17.4In the transportation of Segregated Crude through the Pipeline, the Sender accepts and acknowledges that there will be a minimum front of Pollution Fronts. DC – Contrato de Transporte de Crude Oil – 017 – 2013    66 CLAUSE 18 - RISKS AND LIABILITY18.1Crude Oil’s Custody: The Transporter will exercise the custody over the Hydrocarbon as from the moment in which the Sender, or whoever it designates, delivers it at the Point of Entry, and until the Exit Point.18.2Transporter’s Liability: The Transporter will be liable for the damages or losses caused to the Senders, generated by, derived from or related to the fault or breach, on the Transporter’s part, of the Obligations contained in this Manual, its attachments, the Transportation Contract and the legislation applicable, unless it proves that the damage or loss occurred as a consequence of a Justified Event and that it also adopted a Reasonable Effort. The Transporter will not be responsible for the damages or impairment that the Hydrocarbon Delivered by a Sender can sustain, such as contamination with foreign matters, contamination by the contact of the different types of hydrocarbons, if the damage or deterioration is due to Justified Events. Id in any of those events one or more Senders are involved, all the Hydrocarbons affected will be apportioned between the Senders as a proportion of the Title of each one of the Hydrocarbons involved, without prejudice to the subsequent indemnifications, as the case may be.

It is made in GSV and NSV volumes. For the purposes of the Balance, CENIT’S pipelines consist of three points, as follows: ▪Initial Pumping Station▪Pipeline or line▪End StationThe submarine lines and even the mono – buoys are not owned by CENIT. However, these are the facilities used to perform the operations for the loading of tanker ships. To make the daily and monthly report, it is important to have clarity regarding the possible operations that there are in each Station: Special Operations: In each one of the stations the following special operations may occur, which must be duly supported and registered in the supports of the daily and monthly operation. DC – Contrato de Transporte de Crude Oil – 017 – 2013    82▪Tanks’ Conversion▪Loans▪Return of loans▪Withdrawals upon request of the Company▪Reliefs of afferent lines▪Withdrawals for self – consumption or consumptionThe following special operations can take place in the pipelines:▪Relief of volumes in intermediate stations▪Re – injection of volumes in intermediate stations▪Use of cross – over for the receipt from or dispatch to lines▪Drainage or injections due to maintenance2.1. DAILY BALANCE OF THE SYSTEMCENIT’S purpose is the transportation of Hydrocarbons so it will have no earnings or losses due to variations in quantities or qualities between Deliveries and Withdrawals. The withdrawals of Crude Oil may have a quality different from that of the deliveries and the quantities will take into account the Identifiable Losses, the Non – Identifiable Losses, the Line Fill and the variation of inventories. Description of Losses: Two (2) types of losses are considered: Identifiable Losses and Non – Identifiable Losses, defined in the Second Clause “Definitions” of this Manual. CENIT’S Transportation Systems consider three (3) possible loss points: ▪Initial Pumping Station or Plant▪Pipeline▪Final Station or TerminalIdentifiable Losses and Non – Identifiable Losses can occur in each point. Initial Pumping Station or PlantThe Identifiable Losses are allocated proportionally to the Deliveries in the Initial Pumping Station or Plant of the preceding Calendar Month.The Non – Identifiable Losses are allocated proportionally to the Deliveries in the Initial Pumping Station or Plant of the current Calendar Month.Pipeline or Line▪The Identifiable Losses are distributed as a proportion of the dispatches made from the Initial Pumping Station or Plant in the preceding Calendar Month.▪The Non - Identifiable Losses are distributed as a proportion of the dispatches made from the Initial Pumping Station or Plant in the current Calendar Month. DC – Contrato de Transporte de Crude Oil – 017 – 2013    83Final Station or Terminal▪The Identifiable Losses are distributed as a proportion of the Receipts made from the Final Station or Terminal in the preceding Calendar Month.▪The Non - Identifiable Losses are distributed as a proportion of the Receipts made from the Final Station or Terminal in the current Calendar Month. NON – IDENTIFIABLE LOSSES (P. N.

Monthly balance Initial Pumping Station or Plant: for this case, the calculation sequence is as follows: ▪Total PNI▪PNI per type of crude oil based on Deliveries▪Product Balance selected to identify interface▪Balance for other crude oils transported (checking)Monthly Balance Pipeline or Line: For CENIT SAS’ Pipeline Systems, the calculation sequence is the one established in a general way, taking into account which current is received by the interface volume. Monthly Balance Final Station or Terminal: For the Final Station or Terminal, the calculation sequence is the one set forth in a general way; if it applies for any of CENIT’S systems, this process will be defined by mutual consent among senders and the transporter in each specific case. 2.3.MONTHLY BALANCE PER SENDEROnce the monthly balance of the system per types of crude oil has been obtained, the monthly balance of the system per senders in NSV and GSV volumes; this means that the ownership of the Crude Oil to be transported must be determined through CENIT’S pipelines. For this, it is necessary to have the quality data reported by the inspection companies, the distribution per senders of the balances for transportation of systems or nodes afferent to CENIT SAS’ transportation infrastructure, as well as the distribution of deliveries per tanker trucks; the ships’ matrix per companies, the dispatch reports’ in the final station or terminal. Likewise, the following issues of the balance must be distributed among senders: DC – Contrato de Transporte de Crude Oil – 017 – 2013    86Allocation Criteria: Each one of the items of the Volumetric Balance is distributed per company according to the following criteria: PNIAre allocated among all the senders of the current as a proportion of their deliveries during the current month or month of reportPIAre allocated as a proportion of the deliveries per company of the previous month. In the offshore facilities, the same will be assumed by each one of the senders as a proportion to their participation in the hydrocarbon in each shipment, according to the measures taken in the onshore terminal at Coveñas, in case that loading operations are taking place; in the event that no loading operations are taking place, they will be assumed by the Senders, as a proportion of the deliveries of the previous month in the Terminal.IIIt corresponds to the allocation of the final inventory reported in the monthly balance per senders of the previous month.RcWithdrawals of Fuel, it is allocated according to the percentage of the deliveries of the owners of crude oil withdrawn, if applicableDDispatches. When they correspond to a Station, they are allocated according to the percentages of crude oil available per company, after deducting remaining volumes. In the volumetric balances of the lines, it is determined per system balance.RWithdrawals of companies. It is deducted to the company that requests the withdrawal of the volume.IFFinal Inventory. In the Stations it is calculated per station. In the Volumetric Balances of the lines it corresponds to the distribution according to the percentage of shareholding of the Sender in the company.CVCCorresponds to the adjustments per volumetric compensation per quality of the month to be reported, calculated according to the provisions of Item 5 of this ManualThe general formula of the balance per companies is as followsII + CVC + E – Rc – D – R – PI – PNI – IF = 0Balance Measurement Units: In the volumes’ registration process two (2) kinds of units are used to report the movements of crude oil of the system, as follows: ▪All the information regarding distribution of the ownership of the volume in inventories of the system is made in NSV. ▪The GSV balance will utilize the proportion of property figured out in the net balance of the system to distribute the items of the GSV balance whenever necessary. This means that the contents of water and sediment (BSW) present in the crude oil will be allocated among the senders pr rata to their share of the system’s balances. ▪The resulting information of the NSV balance will be utilized to record the official balances per company and for the report of volumes for collection of the transportation tax. DC – Contrato de Transporte de Crude Oil – 017 – 2013    87▪The resulting information of the GSV balance will be utilized for the charges of the transportation fees of CENIT’S transportation systems. 3.UPDATE OD THE CRUDE OILS’ BASKETThis update is made every year based on: ▪Graphs for the follow – up of the API gravity of each one of the crude oils characterized as pure in the afferent pipelines’ system▪Information of composition of pure crude oils of each afferent pipelines’ operator company. The characterization of Crude Oils is reviewed every month, led by the manager of the valuation and it is reported to and discussed with the Volumetric Compensation per Quality Group, because the systems’ operators are the ones who know, in detail, the operations thereof. The first criterion of review is the API, comparing the value of the Assay and the value of the month to be reported of each Crude. If there are differences of more than 2 API degrees, the following actions take place: ▪The behavior in prior months is reviewed▪It is reported, in writing, to the operator or person responsible of the current in the field in order to identify the causes of the differences.▪The information is analyzed and it is determined, together with the operators, whether or not to carry out a sampling process. ▪If the differences correspond to tests or special punctual operations, it is not shown once again but a more detailed follow up of the crude oil is made. ▪It is the responsibility of the operator to inform the manager of the CVC, in a timely manner, of the possible changes in the Blends to prevent distortions thereofTo make the decision to do the sampling, the following reasons are taken into account:  ▪Changes of more than 2 API degrees of the current to be assessed. Crude oils that present a behavior outside the minimum or maximum limits. ▪Crude oils that, according to the information of the operator, have changed their composition, even when it is not reflected in an API change (new wells, etc). DC – Contrato de Transporte de Crude Oil – 017 – 2013    88▪Entry of new crude oils to a current. New crude oils that have not been sampled and have been declared as commercial. ▪In the case of the extensive tests, it is important to assess the Crude oil or well production forecast and to determine, in a clear manner, the proportions in which it will affect the existing Blends. If the volumes to be transported affect in more than one (1) API degree the initial blend in which it participates, then one of the following actions must be done: ◦Demand that the Operator delivers the Crude oil’s characterization (Assay) or◦Immediate scheduling of sampling and characterization of the Crude oil, or◦Investigate if there is information of this crude oil and see the viability to make a re – cutting.The characterizations are of the Assay type and are done in a laboratory specialized in petroleum analysis. Responsibilities of the operator Companies: The operator companies of each field will be responsible for: ▪Defining which crude oils it considers that must be sampled; ▪Give transportation in the sampling area and necessary permits to do the sampling▪Provide jerrycans for the collection of the samples (3 of 5 gallons). ▪Inform to the representative of the sampling of the place in which the sample is to be taken, The representativeness of the sample is the full responsibility of the field operator. The sampling site cannot have water contents of more than 0.5% vil. If the % is higher, the samples are taken and dried by the operator and delivered in the agreed place. ▪If once the sampling has been made, it is identified that the Sample was not representative of the crude oil and the assay results are not accepted, the cost of the new sampling and analysis will be on the field operator’s account, or the operation company is asked to provide the crude oil characterization report. 4.CRUDE OIL ASSESSMENT PROCESSThis process is made on a monthly basis, between the 10th and the 15th day of each month, immediately after the month to be reported. It is made based on: ▪The price of the crude oil components in the distillation Cuts’ model will be the one established with the arithmetic average of the international prices of the DC – Contrato de Transporte de Crude Oil – 017 – 2013    89two (2) previous Calendar months and the same Calendar month for which the balance is being made. ▪Prices of the International market for petroleum by – products published by Platt’s and consolidated by the company called Purvin & Gertz. ▪Assay – Type characterization of the pure Crudes and simulation of the mixes that occur through the transportation service. ▪Real API of each pure crude and mixes, certified by independent inspectors in each transfer point in custody and / or production. The sequence for the management of information in this process is represented in figure 1 below: Input of Basic Data Product Prices===>Update of data Assay samples or pure crude oils===>Calculation of Prices $ US / Bl===>Update of prices and constants SummaryIllustration 1 – Sequence of activities in the process of assessmentTheoretical reasons of the assessment process: The current compensation utilizes two methods to assess the crude oil: ▪Distillation Cuts▪Linear regression of the API Y % S (Bulk Properties)Distillation Cuts: This method utilizes distillation in the lab that models the behavior of each one of the refining processes (the “Distillation Cut”). Combining the results of the fractioning of the Crude Oil with the prices in the U. S. Market (USGC) of some refined products, the value of the barrel of said crude oil in the same market is determined. Illustration 2 shows the simple refining scheme utilized to characterize the currents that take part in the transportation: DC – Contrato de Transporte de Crude Oil – 017 – 2013    90Illustration 2 – Distillation Scheme used by the TransporterThe cuts made during the distillation in the lab and the analyses made to each one of them are specified in Table 1.

This set of characteristics is internationally known as ASSAY. Additionally, general characteristics of the crude oil are determined, such as the API, sulphur and Factor K.International Prices of Products: The price assigned to each one of the cuts determined above corresponds to prices in the international market published in international magazines, such as Platt’s and Opis. See Table 2. The prices used are those of the USGC, since this is the main market for Colombian crude oils.

Once the constants have been described, it is possible to obtain the price of the crude oil utilizing only the API and sulfur characteristics of that crude oil. When the price must be figured out utilizing the SPI and %S characteristics, the B1 coefficient will be limited for crude oils with an API lower or equal than 35 º (S. G. > 0.8498); however, the B2 coefficient will make the adjustments that correspond to the prices of the crude oils in the entire range of API of the crude oil’s basket. The price equation is: USD $ = Bo + B1 * GE + B2 * %SEquation – calculation of prices per API and %SWhere: Bo = ConstantB1 = Adjustment for specific gravityB2 = Adjustment for sulfur contents5.VOLUMETRIC COMPENSATION FOR QUALITYThis process is made over a monthly basis between day 15 and day 20 of the month of report. It is made based on: ▪Monthly balance per senders▪Crude oil valuation price report5.1.Principles of the Volumetric CompensationDC – Contrato de Transporte de Crude Oil – 017 – 2013    92To make the transportation of Crude Oils of different producers viable, in the Pipelines Crude Oils of different quality characteristics and market values are mixed, and the resulting blend is transported in a segregated manner, As a consequence of the mix of crude oils of different qualities, some Senders will receive a Crude Oil that is more valuable than the one that they delivered to the system, while other senders will receive crude oil that is less valuable than the one delivered. The purpose of the Volumetric Compensation for Quality is to establish a system that allows compensating in volume the Senders that receive Crude oil of a lower quality, discounting the volume from those Senders who receive a Crude Oil of a better capacity than the one delivered. The addition of the volumes accredited and discounted between the Senders must be equal to zero, and therefore the compensation adjustments are made among the Senders and the Pipeline’s operator does not receive any income or has any egress of volume because of the procedure. 5.2.Calculation of the Volumetric Compensation for Quality: The Volumetric Compensation for Quality is a process independent from the monthly balance of the system per senders. This process is made after making said monthly balance official, and the adjustments generated by the process will be included in the monthly balance of the Month of Operation for which the adjustments of the Volumetric Compensation for Quality were figured out. The steps to be followed in the calculation of distribution of volumes in the Volumetric Compensation for Quality are shown in Illustration (3). §    Determine deliveries per Sender(Original Barrels = Ei§    Determine the price of the currents that converge(Qi = $ USD / BBL) x Ei§    Calculate the fraction of the cost fir each sender(F.

II.FRAMEWORK OF ACTIVITYChapter 1.– FRAMEWORK OF REFERENCE1.1.– What is the Ethics Code?It is Cenit’s reference document to manage ethics in the day to day, which contains a set of explicit declarations of behaviors that employees, Cenit’s board members, contractors and suppliers must have, independent from the position or function occupied by them. To act according to this code assures the coherence of the Cornerstones, Relationship Principles and Corporate Governance Code. 1.2.– Who must follow this code?The Ethics Code is applicable to all employees, Cenit’s board members, contractors and suppliers.1.3. What is expected from me?Cenit expects that each one internalizes and utilizes the Ethics Code with good criteria, to practice it, to solve dilemmas, to make decisions, to act and enter into relationships with the stakeholders. If at any point you are in doubt of how to decide, how to solve a dilemma, how to act and how to enter into relationships, resort to this Ethics Code and analyze, in a responsible manner, the consequences of your decision: ▪Is it coherent with what the company expects from me?▪Does it agree with the standards?▪Will it affect my reputation and that of the Company?▪Which are its benefits for the Company?This ethics code contemplates general situations, but it cannot consider all concrete cases, because the realities are complex and diverse; take your time to understand it and to act in a reasonable, prudent and just manner, seeking the reasons that support the decisions and the actions. If you are faced with a situation in which it is not clear for you how to decide, solve a dilemma, act or hold a relationship in a manner that is coherent with what has been established by Cenit, or simply if you have doubts, DC – Contrato de Transporte de Crude Oil – 017 – 2013    193Crude Oil Offloading Agreementquestions or concerns, simply stop and ask for advice from your coworkers, the President, Managers or Directors, or write to our “Ethics Channel”.1.3.1.– How can I promote a culture of ethical performance?Each person promotes, with its example, an ethical culture within Cenit when it is coherent with this Ethics Code in its manner to talk, act and handle relationships. Each one must be a model of the adequate conduct.

Dialog helps us to interpret, as a team, the Ethics Code and the Relationship Principles to apply them in the decisions and actions of the concrete cases and to generate an ethical culture of self – control and of social control. I allow the constructive dialog when: ◦I listen carefully and pay attention to persons◦Build my ideas and judgments based on true and clear information◦Consult my concerns with my coworkers◦Communicate with my coworkers in an appropriate manner◦Tackle any issue with evidences and arguments◦State only what is true and of what I have evidences◦Utilize the Ethics Code, the Cornerstones and the Relationship Principles as grounds of my positionChapter 2.– MY COMMITMENT MAINTAINS CENIT’S EQUITYDC – Contrato de Transporte de Crude Oil – 017 – 2013    194Crude Oil Offloading AgreementAt Cenit, to act in an ethical manner means the true and transparent record of the business, the good use of the corporate assets and the adequate management of information.2.1. – Veracity and Accuracy of the Documentary RecordsThe truthfulness and accuracy of the documentary information it is the responsibility of all.
