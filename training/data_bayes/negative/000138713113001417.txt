 satisfied within the time period set forth herein.

 Original Note), from Borrower to HB, WB and CADDO in the original
 principal amount of the Original Loan, which Original Note was secured by a
 first priority deed of trust dated November 16, 2011, made by Trustor for the
 benefit of HB, WB and CADDO (the Deed of Trust), covering Trustors
