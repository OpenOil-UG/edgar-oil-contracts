In consideration of the mutual promises contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Howell and Participant hereby agree as follows:

 

SECTION I.

SCOPE OF AGREEMENT

(b)           Unit Agreement For the Development and Operation of the Salt Creek South Unit dated September 11, 1961, covering the lands described in Exhibit “A-2” and located within the red boundary as depicted on Exhibit “A-3.”

 

The area included within the exterior boundaries of the Salt Creek Units shall hereafter be referred to together as the “Project Area.”

 

1.2     Participant Interests.  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, Participant hereby desires to jointly fund and participate with Howell in the development of the Salt Creek Units, as provided herein.  As such, Participant’s interests shall be as follows:

 

(a)           with respect to the Assets, Participant’s participation shall be an undivided twenty-three percent (23%) of the interest of Howell in the Assets as such interest existed immediately prior to Closing (“Participant’s Proportionate Share”) pursuant to the terms of this Agreement; and

 

(b)           with respect to any Oil and Gas Interests acquired pursuant to the AMI provisions of Section VI herein, Participant’s election to participate shall be an undivided twenty-three percent (23%) of any Oil and Gas Interest acquired by Howell or Participant, subject to any adjustment of either Party’s ownership interest in the Leases and other EOR Properties pursuant to Section 16.12, and subject to the provisions of Section VI.

 

1.3     Howell Interests.  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, including but not limited to Participant’s Commitment, Howell hereby desires to jointly fund and participate with Participant in the development of the Salt Creek Units as provided herein.  As such, Howell’s interests shall be as follows:



  



1







  



(a)           with respect to the Assets, Howell’s participation shall be an undivided seventy-seven percent (77%) of the interest of Howell in the Assets as such interest existed immediately prior to Closing (“Howell’s Proportionate Share”) pursuant to the terms of this Agreement; and

 

(b)           with respect to any Oil and Gas Interests acquired pursuant to the AMI provisions of Section VI herein, Howell’s election to participate shall be an undivided seventy-seven percent (77%) of any Oil and Gas Interest acquired by Howell or Participant, subject to any adjustment of either Party’s ownership interest in the Leases and other EOR Properties pursuant to Section 16.12, and subject to the provisions of Section VI.

 

1.4     Effective Date.  This Agreement and the conveyance of Participant’s Proportionate Share of the Assets shall be effective between the Parties at 7:00 a.m. Mountain Time on the first day of the month in which the Closing occurs (the “Effective Date”).

 

1.5     Casualty or Condemnation Loss.  

 

(a)           Subject to the terms and provisions of this Agreement, to the extent of Participant’s Proportionate Share of the Properties to be assigned to Participant pursuant to this Agreement, Participant shall assume all risk of loss with respect to, and any change in, the condition of the Properties during the period of time commencing on March 16, 2012 and ending on the Closing Date (such period, the “Pre-Closing Period”) for production of Hydrocarbons therefrom through normal depletion (including but not limited to the watering out of any Well or the collapsed casing or sand infiltration of any Well) and the depreciation of Equipment due to ordinary wear and tear.

 

(b)           If, during the Pre-Closing Period, any portion of the Assets is destroyed by fire or other casualty or is taken in condemnation or under right of eminent domain, Participant’s Commitment shall be reduced by the total amount of all sums received by Howell from Third Parties by reason of such casualty or taking including any insurance claims, unpaid awards, and other rights against Third Parties (other than Affiliates of Howell and its and their directors, officers, employees and agents) arising out of the casualty or taking (the total amount of such sums, the “Casualty Proceeds”). Howell shall notify Participant of any such casualty or taking as soon as reasonably practicable (but in any event, no later than three (3) days) after Howell acquires knowledge thereof.

 

1.6           Operation of Business.  During the Pre-Closing Period, Howell shall (a) operate its business and Assets in the ordinary course and in accordance with the standards used by a prudent oil and gas operator in a like position and (b) maintain all material Permits affecting the Properties.  In the event of an emergency, Howell may take such action as a prudent operator would take and shall notify Participant of such action promptly thereafter.  Participant acknowledges that Howell may not own an undivided interest in certain of the Properties and Participant agrees that the acts or omissions of the other working interest owners who are not affiliated with Howell shall not constitute a violation of the provisions of this Section 1.6 nor shall any action required by a vote of working interest owners constitute such a violation so long as Howell has voted its interest in a manner consistent with the provisions of this Section 1.6.

PARTICIPANT’S FUNDING OBLIGATIONS/PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT ACCOUNT

 

4.1     Participant’s Commitment.

 

(a)           Description of Participant’s Commitment.  As a material inducement to Howell to enter into this Agreement and subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, Participant agrees to pay and commits to fund Howell’s share of capital investment and costs as described herein in the total amount of Four Hundred Million Dollars U.S. ($400,000,000.00) (herein “Participant’s Commitment”).  Participant’s Commitment shall be tendered, deposited or expended pursuant to Section 10.1 solely for Howell’s Proportionate Share of costs attributable to the following: 

 

(i)           at Howell’s sole discretion, funding capital investment costs for G & G projects covering the Project Area or any part thereof (herein “G&G Projects”), including participation in a 3D or 2D seismic program or the purchase of a license to or ownership in existing 3D or 2D seismic surveys; and 

 

(ii)           funding all Unit Development Costs.

 

(b)           Limitations.  Howell’s use of such funds from Participant’s Commitment shall be limited as follows:

 

(i)           Not more than Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000.00) of Participant’s Commitment may be utilized by Howell at its election for the capital investment costs for G&G Projects (herein “Participant’s Non-UDC Commitment Cap”), with the balance of Participant’s Commitment being utilized by Howell for all Unit Development Costs.  In the event Howell elects not to spend the entire amount of Participant’s Non-UDC Commitment Cap for the costs and expenses for G&G Projects, then Howell may use the unspent balance of Participant’s Non-UDC Commitment Cap for any Unit Development Costs, subject in all respects to Participant’s Commitment. 

 

(ii)           The Participant’s Commitment shall be initially committed to the Unit Development Costs for the Initial EOR Program and (subject to Participant’s Non-UDC Commitment Cap) any G&G Projects included therein.  Upon completion of the Initial EOR Program the remaining balance of the Participant’s Commitment, if any, may be used for other EOR Programs, other Maintenance and Repair Costs or (subject to Participant’s Non-UDC Commitment Cap) other G&G Projects.



  



17







  



4.2     Allocation.  Participant’s Commitment shall be allocated as follows:  

 

(a)one hundred percent (100%) of the Unit Development Costs and (subject to Participant’s Non-UDC Commitment Cap) the capital investment costs for any G&G Projects, in each case, that Howell will “incur” pursuant to this Agreement, from and after the Effective Date (herein “Participant’s Commitment Effective Date”), and thereafter during calendar year 2012; and 

 

(b)ninety percent (90%) of the Unit Development Costs and (subject Participant’s Non-UDC Commitment Cap) the capital investment costs for any G&G Projects, in each case, that Howell will “incur” pursuant to this Agreement from and after January 1, 2013.

 

For the purposes of subparagraphs (a) and (b) above, and in order to avoid the allocation of costs for a particular operation or project for a time period occurring both prior to and after January 1, 2013,  if (i) a G&G Project is actually commenced on or before December 31, 2012, or (ii) an operation associated with an EOR Well or other Enhanced Recovery operations with an AFE less than $5,000,000 has commenced on or before December 31, 2012, then all of the costs of such G&G Project or all of the Unit Development Costs of such EOR Well, as the case may be, shall be subject to the 100% carry provisions of subparagraph (a) above.  Otherwise, as used in this Section IV, the term “incur” or “incurred” shall mean those Unit Development Costs attributable to the activities described in Section 4.1 which are accrued by or on behalf of Howell (for pre-Participant’s Commitment Effective Date periods) and/or “cash-called” pursuant to a Request for Advance (for post-Participant’s Commitment Effective Date periods) to actually fund the specific activity described in Section 4.1, as provided in and in accordance with this Agreement.

 

4.3     Records and Accounting.  Howell shall at all times maintain and keep true and correct books and records with respect to the expenditures referred to in Section 4.1 and the status of Participant’s Commitment in accordance with sound, accurate GAAP and consistent with the various provisions of this Agreement (including COPAS Exhibit “K”).  Participant shall have the audit rights provided in the COPAS accounting procedure attached as Exhibit “K” hereto with respect to which Participant’s Commitment is utilized from and after the date that such costs are incurred by Howell pursuant to the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the procedures set forth in COPAS.  With regard to Participant’s Proportionate Share of costs for Enhanced Recovery operations or other operations, Howell shall furnish to Participant accounting (through a joint interest billing or other method) in the normal course of Howell’s business and in accordance with the applicable of the Salt Creek JOA or the Salt Creek Unit Operating Agreements and COPAS provisions.

 

4.4     Commitment Termination.  The proposed operations included in the Initial EOR Program, attached hereto as Exhibit “J,” are provided as an estimate only, and Howell makes no representation or commitment regarding the actual date by which Participant’s Commitment may be fully utilized as provided in this Agreement.  If, however, the entire amount of Participant’s Commitment has not been requested pursuant to a Request for Advance in accordance with Section 10.1 by or before October 1, 2018, then any portion of Participant’s Commitment which has not been requested pursuant to a Request for Advance as provided herein (herein “Participant’s Unspent Commitment”) shall no longer be available for Howell’s funding under this Agreement, and Participant’s obligation to fund Participant’s Unspent Commitment shall automatically terminate.  Any portion of Participant’s Commitment that has not been spent by October 31, 2018 shall be returned to Participant.

 

4.5     Participation Agreement Account.  The Participation Agreement Account shall be established by Howell within 25 days after Closing.  Howell shall maintain the Participation Agreement Account as a separate account and Howell shall not commingle other funds with the funds in such Participation Agreement Account.  Howell shall make appropriate withdrawals from the Participation Agreement Account and cause all funds to be transferred from the Participation Agreement Account to

SECTION VI.

AREA OF MUTUAL INTEREST

 

6.1 Area of Mutual Interest.  From and after the Effective Date, the Parties hereby establish an area of mutual interest covering all lands and acquisitions of Acquired Interests within the Project Area (the “AMI”).

 

6.2     AMI Coverage.  The AMI shall cover any Oil and Gas Interests lying wholly or partially within the AMI, including re-acquisitions of expired jointly-owned Leases or renewals of jointly-owned Leases, fee mineral interests, royalty interests, net profits interests, overriding royalty interests, working interests, operating rights, or any farmouts or other contracts or agreements, excluding, however, Oil and Gas Interests owned by a Party as of the date of this Agreement (an “Acquired Interest”).  Should either Party or its Affiliate acquire (the “Acquiring Party”), by purchase, trade, or otherwise, after the Effective Date, an Acquired Interest wholly or partially within the AMI, (“AMI Leases”) then, within thirty (30) days after such acquisition, the Acquiring Party shall give written notice of the acquisition to the non-acquiring Party, which notice shall include a complete description of the Acquired Interest and information specifying the number of gross and net lease acres, existing overriding royalties or other burdens affecting the Acquired Interest, available information regarding title and environmental conditions, including a copy of any environmental assessment or study available to the Acquiring Party (it being agreed that the Acquiring Party shall not be obligated to prepare or acquire any environmental information other than in its normal course of business), the purchase price and the terms of the acquisition, as well as the actual acquisition costs, the obligations required to earn such interest, including bonus considerations or equivalent if other than cash, broker’s fees, recording fees, and rentals, and any other information the Acquiring Party deems relevant to the acquisition of its AMI Proportionate Share of the Acquired Interest.  

 

6.3     Acquired Interests.  Upon receipt of such acquisition notice, the non-acquiring Party shall have the right, for a period of thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice, in which to make its election to acquire its AMI Proportionate Share of the Acquired Interest.  In the event a non-acquiring Party desires to take its AMI Proportionate Share of the Acquired Interest, it shall make its election in writing, accompanied by a payment to the Acquiring Party for its AMI Proportionate Share of the costs and expenses of the acquisition prior to the expiration of the thirty (30) day notice period, and such amount shall be distributed to the Acquiring Party as a reimbursement for bearing such cost and expenses attributable to the Acquired Interest.  Promptly after a non-acquiring Party’s election to acquire its AMI Proportionate Share of such Acquired Interest, the Acquiring Party shall assign said interest to the non-acquiring Party, subject to the terms of this Agreement, on substantially the form of assignment attached hereto as Exhibit “G,” but free and clear of any Liens or burdens created by the Acquiring Party.  Upon such assignment, the Acquired Interest shall become subject to the provisions of this Agreement.  Failure of the non-acquiring Party to (i) respond to an acquisition notice, and (ii) pay to the Acquiring Party its 




  



20







  




AMI Proportionate Share of the acquisition costs incurred in the acquisition of the Acquired Interest within the thirty (30) day election period following receipt of a notice of acquisition shall be deemed an election not to acquire said Acquired Interest.  If a non-acquiring Party elects not to participate in such offer or is deemed to have relinquished its rights to purchase or to participate in the Acquired Interest, the Acquiring Party shall own such Acquired Interest free and clear of the provisions of the AMI and this Agreement.  The failure of a non-acquiring Party to participate in any particular Acquired Interest will not affect its rights to subsequent Acquired Interests.

 

(a)           If two or more Acquired Interests are included in a single notice, the non-acquiring Party shall have the right to make separate elections as to each such Acquired Interest.  

 

(b)           If an Acquired Interest covers non-contiguous parcels of land, some of which are located within the boundaries of the AMI and some of which are located outside the boundaries, the provisions of this Section VI will not apply to those lands located wholly outside the boundaries of the AMI.

 

(c)           If an Acquired Interest covers contiguous lands that lie both inside and outside the boundaries of the AMI(s), the provisions of this Section VI will apply only to those lands located within the boundaries of the AMI.

 

(d)           When less than the entire area covered by an acquisition of an Acquired Interest is offered, the Acquiring Party’s cost applicable to the portion offered shall be that portion of the total cost which the offered portion bears to the total acquisition on a net mineral acreage basis.

 

6.4     Excluded Acquisitions.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the provisions set forth in this Section VI shall not apply to any acquisitions which (i) result from a merger, consolidation, entity consolidation, reorganization with, by, or between a parent company, subsidiary, or Affiliate of either of the Parties hereto, or (ii) result from a merger or acquisition of the stock of another company or all of an entity or partnership or an acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets of an entity by the Acquiring Party, whether by cash, like-kind exchange, stock purchase or otherwise (other than any of the foregoing where all or substantially all of the assets of the acquired company, entity or partnership, as the case may be, consists of Oil and Gas Interests in the Project Area); provided that the Acquiring Party shall not engage in any transaction with the intent or purpose of evading or avoiding any of the obligations set forth in this Section VI.  For the avoidance of any doubt, the Parties acknowledge and agree that this AMI shall not be construed in any manner and shall not be applicable to circumstances where the sale of all or a portion of a Party’s interest in the Leases and/or any other jointly-owned Leases in the Project Area is to another Party to this Agreement.

 

6.5     Ownership.  The ownership and cost sharing interests of the Parties with respect to Acquired Interests covered by the AMI and in which both Parties own an interest shall be in accordance with their respective AMI Proportionate Shares and shall be subject to the terms of the Salt Creek JOA.

 

6.6     Term of AMI.  The AMI term shall terminate upon the end of the Term of this Agreement.

 

6.7     Warranty of Title.  If either Party acquires any Oil and Gas Interests in the Project Area subject to the AMI provisions provided in this Section VI and the other Party elects to acquire its AMI Proportionate Share of an interest therein pursuant to this Section VI, then the acquiring Party shall , subject to Permitted Encumbrances, warrant title by, through, and under itself to the electing Party, and not otherwise, with respect to the electing Party’s AMI Proportionate Share therein.

SECTION VIII.

OPERATION OF THE PROJECT AREA

 

8.1     Salt Creek JOA.

 

(a)           For purposes of governing the relationship between Howell and Participant with respect to the development and operation of each of the Salt Creek Units, the Parties shall execute the joint operating agreement attached hereto as Exhibit “R” (“Salt Creek JOA”).  In addition, Participant shall execute the Ratification of the Salt Creek Units attached hereto as Exhibit “P.”

 

(b)           As between Howell and Participant, the operations of the Parties and the ownership, management and operation of the Project Area shall be governed by and subject to this Agreement, the Salt Creek JOA and the Salt Creek Unit Operating Agreements.  To the maximum extent possible, the Salt Creek JOA and this Agreement shall control the operations of the Parties and the ownership, management and operation of the Project Area and, in the event of a conflict, ambiguity, or inconsistency between the provisions of the Salt Creek JOA and the Salt Creek Unit Operating Agreements, the Salt Creek JOA shall control.  The existence of a provision in one agreement and the absence of a corresponding provision in the other agreement shall not be deemed a conflict, ambiguity, or inconsistency.  

 

(c)           Except for Participant’s Proportionate Share of amounts allowed by the COPAS Exhibit to the Salt Creek JOA, neither Howell nor its Affiliates shall charge Participant any amount for use of existing surface rights associated with the Salt Creek Units operations and Facilities.

 

8.2     Designation of Operator/Operator Standard.  Participant has designated Howell as Operator under this Agreement and the Salt Creek JOA.  Howell (subject to the terms and provisions of the applicable Salt Creek Unit Operating Agreements and the Salt Creek JOA, and the provisions of this Agreement), shall have exclusive charge, management and control of all operations to be conducted on the Project Area pursuant to this Agreement, and Howell may take any and all actions which a reasonable prudent operator would take under similar circumstances and deem necessary or advisable in the management, operation and control thereof.  Howell shall operate and maintain all EOR Properties as would a reasonably prudent operator under similar circumstances in accordance with good oil field practices, shall comply with all Applicable Laws, and shall notify Participant if Howell receives a notice from any Governmental Authority alleging failure to comply with any such Applicable Law.  Howell shall proceed as a reasonably prudent operator to protect and preserve the Leases and any other jointly-owned leases in the Project Area and promptly (and, unless the same are being contested in good faith and by appropriate proceedings, before the same are delinquent) pay or cause to be paid all costs and expenses





  



23







  





(including all Taxes and all costs, expenses and liabilities for labor, materials and equipment incurred in connection with EOR Properties and its share of all obligations to the holders of royalty interests and other interests affecting the Oil and Gas Interests) incurred from and after the Effective Date and during the Term of this Agreement, in developing, operating and maintaining the Leases and any other jointly-owned leases in the Project Area, and shall keep Participant’s Proportionate Share of the Leases and any other jointly-owned Leases in the Project Area free and clear of all Liens other than the Permitted Encumbrances.  Howell’s obligations under this Section 8.2 shall extend to all activities under the EOR Programs, including rig management, management of partner agreements and decisions of when and how to drill or rework individual EOR Wells and Facilities.

 

8.3     Sale of Production. The Parties shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, at Closing a crude oil marketing agreement in the form attached on Exhibit “O” (the “Joint Marketing Agreement”) with respect to the purchase and marketing by Howell of Participant’s Proportionate Share of Hydrocarbons produced from the Project Area from time to time.  No marketing fee shall be charged to Participant for such marketing services. 

 

8.4     CO2 Sourcing.

 

(a)           Supply of CO2.  Howell and Participant acknowledge that Howell must purchase the majority of the CO2 to be used for the EOR Programs and, as such, Howell can only take such action and exercise such rights and remedies so as to maintain the CO2 supply and operate the EOR Programs that may be available to Howell, under Applicable Law and contract, as a purchaser of CO2 (provided that Howell shall never be obligated to enter into any CO2 purchase or supply arrangements that it, in its reasonable discretion, deems to be commercially unreasonable or uneconomical).  Howell is a party to the Exxon CO2 Agreement.  Pursuant to the Exxon CO2 Agreement, Howell has the exclusive right to purchase certain volumes of CO2 for resale, redelivery or use within the Project Area and other lands.  Title to the CO2 provided for Enhanced Recovery operations within the Project Area shall not transfer to Participant.

 

(b)           Commitment of CO2.  Subject to limitations of Force Majeure, Howell shall make reasonable commercial efforts to make the CO2 volumes set forth on an annual basis under the column designated “Salt Creek Scheduled Takes” on Exhibit “T-1” attached hereto, available for use in the Enhanced Recovery operations associated with the Salt Creek Units to the extent available and delivered under the Exxon CO2 Agreement and so long as the volumes are reasonably required by the EOR Programs.  The CO2 shall be made available for use in Enhanced Recovery operations within the Project Area on a first priority basis ahead of CO2 made available for use in Enhanced Recovery operations associated with other Howell-operated properties (including the Monell Unit and Lynch Unit) or other Third Party-operated properties.  However, because Howell will be subject to ExxonMobil’s performance under the Exxon CO2 Agreement and other supply contracts and unforeseen disruptions out of the control of Howell, Howell’s obligation shall at all times be to operate the EOR Programs and to enforce and preserve its rights under the Exxon CO2 Agreement as a reasonable prudent operator so as to maintain injection rates as anticipated in the EOR Programs, but Howell cannot and does not represent or warrant a fixed volume or rate of CO2 injection nor does Howell represent or warrant that there will not be fluctuations in injection rates from time to time.  

 

(c)           Take or Pay Obligation.  Under the terms of the Exxon CO2 Agreement, Howell is obligated to take or pay for certain CO2 contract quantities as fully described in Article 7 of the Settlement Agreement dated January 1, 2008 between Exxon Mobil Gas and Power Marketing Company and Howell Petroleum Corporation and Anadarko E&P Company L.P. (“Take or Pay Obligation”).  In consideration for making available the quantities of CO2 to the Project Area on a priority basis as provided hereunder, from or after the Effective Date Participant shall assume its Proportionate Share of 



  



24







  



the liability and obligations associated with the Take or Pay Obligation attributable to the difference between the “Salt Creek Scheduled Takes” described in Section 8.4(b) and the actual volume of CO2 used in the Enhanced Recovery operations associated with the Project Area during the term of the Exxon CO2 Agreement.  However, Participant’s Proportionate Share of the Take or Pay Obligations shall be reduced in the proportion to the CO2 volumes used in Enhanced Recovery operations associated with fields other than the Project Area.  The calculations of such Take or Pay Obligation on the Exhibit “T-2” are provided for illustrative purposes only.  

 

(d)           Limits on Use.  The CO2 provided by Howell hereunder shall be for use in the EOR Programs subject to the limitations set forth in the Exxon CO2 Agreement.  In the event Howell and Participant, in their joint discretion, propose to “blow-down” the Salt Creek Units and/or monetize the CO2, the Participant, for no additional consideration, shall be entitled to Participant’s Proportionate Share of any proceeds derived from the actual re-sale of (i) Recycled CO2; (ii) the volumes of CO2 injected in connection with the EOR Programs in which Participant participates during the Term of this Agreement; and (iii) volumes associated with the Take or Pay Obligation attributable to CO2 volumes that are otherwise sold to a Third Party.

 

(e)           Cost.  Participant shall bear its Proportionate Share of the price paid for the use of CO2 and other related fees as provided under the CO2 Memorandum of Understanding. 

 

(f)           Acceleration of CO2 Injection.  Participant agrees that Howell may, in its sole discretion as a reasonable prudent operator, accelerate CO2 injection rates, which may include the purchase of additional volumes of CO2 for the EOR Programs.  In such event, Howell agrees that the cost to Participant for the increased volume of CO2, whether supplied under the Exxon CO2 Agreement or through alternative sources, shall not exceed Howell’s Purchase Price for CO2 as defined in the CO2 Memorandum of Understanding. 

 

(g)           CO2 Emission Reductions.  Participant acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement does not include any right, credit, interest, entitlement or other benefit (present or future), arising from actions resulting in any greenhouse gas Emission Reductions as a result of its participation in the EOR Programs.  For purposes of this section, “Emission Reductions” means reductions or avoidance of emissions of greenhouse gases, or sequestration of carbon from the atmosphere, as measured in metric tons of carbon dioxide gas, or, in the case of methane and other greenhouse gases, of carbon dioxide equivalent metric tons.  Howell will retain such emission reductions for its own sale or retention, at its sole discretion, as it sees fit, with no value derived therefrom due to Participant.

 

(h)           Banked Volumes.  The Exxon CO2 Agreement allowed Howell, as the purchaser of the CO2, to bank CO2 volumes in excess of the quantity required to be taken in any particular contract year for purposes of offsetting future Take-or-Pay Obligations.  As of November 30, 2007, Howell was credited with a banked volume of CO2 of 31,227 MMCF.  After November 30, 2007, Howell cannot obtain additional banked volume credits pursuant to the terms of the Exxon CO2 Agreement.  Participant shall receive the benefit of its Proportionate Share of the 31,227 MMCF banked credits for purposes of offsetting any future Take or Pay Obligations. No additional consideration shall be paid by Participant for these banked volumes.

 

8.5     Insurance/Self Insurance and Uninsured Losses.  At Closing, Participant shall provide evidence that it has obtained, or caused to be obtained, and maintains, or causes to be maintained, during the Term of this Agreement insurance coverage relating to Participant’s Proportionate Share of the ownership, operation and maintenance of EOR Properties in such amounts, with provisions for such deductible amounts and of the types set forth on Exhibit “D” to the Salt Creek JOA.  Alternatively, Howell and Participant shall each have the right to satisfy the foregoing obligations through self-



  



25







  



insurance, if consistent with Howell’s risk management practices.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Participant may request that Howell’s insurance cover Participant’s Proportionate Share of any interest applicable to the EOR Properties from the Closing Date until such time as Participant is able to complete arrangements to acquire such insurance for such properties, but in no event longer than sixty (60) days after Closing.  Howell shall be promptly compensated by Participant for such coverage which shall be equal to the annual cost for the insurance actually obtained by Participant in compliance with this Section 8.5, pro-rated to the actual days covered by Howell.

 

8.6     Seismic Survey Operations.  During the Term of this Agreement, Howell may propose to conduct seismic survey operations in accordance with the terms of the Salt Creek JOA covering all or a portion of the Project Area in accordance with the terms set forth therein.  Both Howell and Participant shall receive proprietary rights and ownership of all seismic data from seismic surveys in which they both participate under the Salt Creek JOA.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in the Salt Creek JOA, (i) Howell may designate its Affiliate to receive the proprietary rights and ownership of seismic data from seismic surveys in which Howell participates under the Salt Creek JOA, and (ii) Participant may designate its Affiliate to receive the proprietary rights and ownership of seismic data from seismic surveys in which Participant participates under the Salt Creek JOA.  In addition, the applicable of Howell or its designated Affiliate and the applicable of Participant or its designated Affiliate shall enter into a Geophysical Data Use Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit “I” (“Geophysical Data Use Agreement”) covering the jointly acquired seismic data, which Geophysical Data Use Agreement shall be executed by the Parties prior to receipt of the applicable seismic data.  If a proposed seismic survey covers lands within and outside the Project Area, Participant shall have the right to make a separate election as to the lands within the Project Area and as to the lands outside the Project Area.  Participant’s election as to lands within the Project Area shall be governed by this Agreement; an election as to lands outside the Project Area shall be subject to the negotiation of a mutually acceptable agreement between the Parties. 

 

8.7     Government Regulation.  Howell and Participant shall be subject to all Applicable Laws with respect to the Project Area and their respective obligations hereunder.  Howell shall make all required regulatory reports with all applicable agencies, boards, officials, commissions and other Governmental Authorities having jurisdiction with respect to operation of the Salt Creek Units.

 

8.8     Reporting Requirements.  Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement or the applicable Salt Creek JOA or Salt Creek Unit Operating Agreements, Howell shall furnish Participant access to the same information and reports that are customarily generated in the field and sent to Howell that relate to the EOR Properties or other operations subject to this Agreement in which Participant is a participating party.

 

8.9     Approval of Operations and Non-Consent.

 

(a)           Initial EOR Program.  In accordance with the terms of Section 7.1 of this Agreement, Howell has established an Initial EOR Program for development of the Salt Creek Units.  Howell, in its sole and exclusive discretion, shall conduct operations to implement the Initial EOR Program and the following operations and expenditures shall be deemed to be approved by the Parties under the terms of the Salt Creek JOA (“Initial EOR Program Operations”):

 

(i)           All expenditures for drilling, reworking, sidetracking, Completing, recompleting, plugging back, and Enhanced Recovery operations contemplated under the Initial EOR Program and any reasonable and prudent modifications to the Initial EOR Program; 



  



26







  



(ii)           All expenditures for sourcing of CO2 in the volumes contemplated under the terms of the Initial EOR Program; and

 

(iii)           All expenditures for Maintenance and Repair contemplated under the terms of the Initial EOR Program. 

 

No further approval under the terms of the Salt Creek JOA or either Salt Creek Unit Operating Agreement shall be required to conduct the Initial EOR Program Operations.  

 

(b)           CO2 Volumes.  Howell, in its sole discretion, while acting as a reasonable and prudent operator shall determine the volumes of CO2 to be used to continue existing production from the Project Area and the production established under the Initial EOR Program.  No further approval under the terms of the Salt Creek JOA shall be required to obtain such CO2 volumes.

 

(c)           Subsequent Operations and Programs.  Any Enhanced Recovery projects, expenditures or other operations that are not included within the Initial EOR Program shall be proposed in accordance with the provisions set forth in Sections 8.9(c)(i) and 8.9(c)(ii).  Any non-Enhanced Recovery projects, expenditures or other operations shall be proposed in accordance with the provisions set forth in Section 8.9(c)(iii). 

 

(i)           New EOR Programs.  Any projects, expenditures or other operations for Enhanced Recovery intended to establish initial production from Lands that have not previously produced oil or gas pursuant to Enhanced Recovery operations involving injection of CO2 (a “New EOR Program”), shall be proposed by Howell in accordance with the following provisions:  

 

(A)           Howell shall deliver a written notice to Participant of the New EOR Program (“Notice of Proposal”) in accordance with Article VI.B.1. of the Salt Creek JOA, and the Notice of Proposal will include the scope, intent, and plan for the New EOR Program and a budget setting out a reasonable estimate of the anticipated Unit Development Costs for the proposed New EOR Program.  

 

(B)           Participant shall have 30 days after receipt of the Notice of Proposal within which to notify Howell whether Participant elects to participate in the New EOR Program.  Participant’s failure to reply to the Notice of Proposal within the time periods set forth in this Section 8.9(c)(i) shall constitute an election by Participant not to participate in the New EOR Program.

 

(C)           If Participant consents to the proposed New EOR Program then the operations and expenditures associated with the New EOR Program shall be deemed approved under the Salt Creek JOA and the Salt Creek Unit Operating Agreements and Participant shall contribute its Proportionate Share of the Unit Development Costs of the New EOR Program.  Participant’s Commitment, if available as provided in Section 4.1(b)(ii), shall be applied to Howell’s Proportionate Share of the Unit Development Costs of the New EOR Program. 

 

(D)           If Participant does not consent, or is deemed to be non-consent, to the proposed New EOR Program, then, notwithstanding any rights of approval under the Salt Creek JOA or the Salt Creek Unit Operating Agreements, Howell may proceed with the New EOR Program and the Participant shall be subject to the non-consent penalty under Section 8.9(d)(i) with respect to its Proportionate Share of the Unit Development Costs of the New EOR Program.  Participant’s Commitment, if available as provided in Section 4.1(b)(ii), shall be applied to Howell’s Proportionate Share of the Unit Development Costs of the New EOR Program.



  



27







  



(E)           Subject in all respects to Section 16.12, a New EOR Program may be proposed by Participant or any other party to the Salt Creek JOA at any time on either of the Salt Creek Units, and such proposal shall be valid and subject to the election provisions of this Section 8.9(c) (a “Valid Proposal”) only upon the approval of Howell; provided, however, in the event Howell (i) is no longer Operator of each of the Salt Creek Units, or (ii) has transferred or assigned all or a portion of its interest in each of the Salt Creek Units to a Third Party, then such proposal shall be a Valid Proposal only upon the affirmative vote of two or more parties to the Salt Creek JOA owning a majority interest based on ownership shown on Exhibit “A” to the Salt Creek JOA then in effect.

 

(ii)           Other Enhanced Recovery Operations.  Any projects, expenditures (including Maintenance and Repair), or other operations for Enhanced Recovery that are not part of the Initial EOR Program or a New EOR Program (herein “Subsequent EOR Operations”) shall be proposed by Howell in the same manner as a New EOR Program.  For those costs associated with such Subsequent EOR Operations during a calendar year that do not exceed $20,000,000.00  (8/8ths), Participant shall be required to participate in such operations for its Proportionate Share.  For those costs associated with such Subsequent EOR Operations during a calendar year that exceed $20,000,000.00 (8/8ths), Howell shall propose each such operation in the same manner as a New EOR Program and, if applicable, the non-consent provisions of Section 8.9(d)(ii) shall apply.  Participant’s Commitment, if available as provided in Section 4.1(b)(ii), shall be applied to Howell’s Proportionate Share of the costs of Subsequent EOR Operations.  For the avoidance of doubt, Participant’s election not to participate in a Subsequent EOR Operation shall not prevent Howell from undertaking the operation.

 

(iii)           Non-Enhanced Recovery Operations.  Any non-Enhanced Recovery operations (including without limitation conventional vertical and horizontal drilling for primary production of oil and gas) shall be proposed by either Party at any time pursuant to the terms of the Salt Creek JOA.  Participant’s Commitment shall not be applied to the costs of non-Enhanced Recovery operations.

9.2     Termination or Expiration of Agreement.  The termination or expiration of this Agreement shall not relieve either Party hereto from any rights, benefits, expense, liabilities or obligations or any remedies which have accrued or attached prior to the effective date of such termination or expiration.  

 

SECTION X.

REQUESTS FOR ADVANCE; ACCOUNTING, DEFAULT; REMEDIES

 

10.1    Requests for Advance, Advances.  All payments of Participant’s Commitment by Participant to the Participation Agreement Account pursuant to this Agreement shall be made by monthly “cash calls” from time to time during the Term hereof (each an “Advance” and collectively the “Advances”).  Participant agrees to fund the Requests for Advances submitted to Participant in accordance herewith, as and when due and payable under the terms of this Agreement.  A Request for Advance attributable to Participant’s Commitment shall be determined in the following manner:

 

(a)           Howell shall reasonably estimate the costs it will incur for the succeeding calendar month.  Such estimate will consider costs incurred for prior months, and such estimate will be reasonably adjusted for Enhanced Recovery and EOR Well activity, actual cost trends, expected increases or decreases in costs, and other factors which may reasonably affect the estimate.

 

(b)           Howell shall provide (not earlier than the 20th day of each calendar month) a general description of such estimated costs to Participant together with a request for Advance from Participant in the same amount (“Request for Advance”), subject to Participant’s Commitment.  Each Advance shall be made pursuant to a Request for Advance.

 

(c)           All Requests for Advances will be in the form of a letter requesting the Advance, signed by the (i) EOR Program Manager or (ii) Manager – Joint Interest Accounting for Howell (or his/her designee having such authority), which letter shall include:

 

(i)           the current Request for Advance amount (in US dollars) and a statement reflecting on a cumulative basis all prior Advances received by Howell; and



  



29







  



(ii)           a schedule of operations for Enhanced Recovery projects, containing the type of project proposal, Howell AFE number, Howell cost center number, anticipated Commencement Date, 8/8ths AFE cost estimate for the Unit Development Costs,  Howell’s working interest, and the net Advance (in US dollars).  

 

(d)           Each Advance paid by Participant shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Participation Agreement Account, in immediately available funds (US dollars) within twenty (20) days after Participant’s receipt of a Request for Advance.

 

10.2    Netting Revenue to Expenses.  Notwithstanding the provisions of the Salt Creek JOA or the Salt Creek Unit Operating Agreements, in the ordinary course of accounting for revenues and expenses, Howell shall have the right to collect from the purchaser or retain unto itself, as applicable, the proceeds from the sale of Participant’s Proportionate Share of the Hydrocarbons produced under the terms of Salt Creek Units and Howell may net and offset such amounts against the Participant’s Proportionate Share and Participant’s Commitment attributable to Howell’s Proportionate Share of the costs incurred under the terms of the Salt Creek Unit Operating Agreements, Salt Creek JOA and this Agreement.  The revenues used to net and offset Participant’s Proportionate Share and Participant’s Commitment attributable to Howell’s Proportionate Share of the costs shall be reflected on the invoices along with the net amount owed, and other reasonable detail as requested by Participant. 

 

10.3    Default by Participant.

 

(a)           In the event that prior to Participant’s Commitment Termination Date, (i) Participant fails to timely fund any Request for Advance (or any portion thereof) of Participant’s Commitment which failure is not cured within twenty (20) days after delivery of a notice (herein a “Notice of Default”) to Participant of such failure by Howell, and/or (ii) either Participant or its parent company identified in Exhibit “L” is subject to a Bankruptcy Event, then, in each case, Participant shall be deemed to be in default (herein (i) and (ii) are a “Participant Default”) under this Agreement.  Upon the occurrence of a Participant Default under this Section 10.3, Howell shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate this Agreement and collect the outstanding balance of Participant’s Commitment (herein the “Termination Payment”) from Participant in accordance with the procedure described in Section 10.5.  Howell shall not be required to send Participant more than two Notices of Default in any calendar year.  

 

(b)           If there is a Participant Default under Section 10.3(a)(ii), or if after sending two Notices of Default in a calendar year another Participant Default occurs under Section 10.3(a)(i), the Termination Payment shall be immediately due and payable without the need for any Notice of Default or other notice or demand whatsoever and this Agreement shall automatically terminate except Section 10.6 shall survive.

 

10.4    Sole Remedy for Participant’s Default under Section 10.3.  If a Participant Default continues beyond any applicable cure period and in case Howell terminates this Agreement, Howell’s sole and exclusive remedy for such Participant Default under this Agreement and in any action brought under law or equity by Howell or any of its Affiliates or shareholders in any court or arbitration shall be to receive the Termination Payment and any pre- and post-judgment interest until paid in full and reasonable attorney fees associated with the collection of the same but shall not limit Howell’s remedies available under the terms of the Salt Creek JOA.  In no event shall Participant be required to relinquish, forfeit or sell any of the Oil and Gas Interests conveyed to Participant by Howell as a remedy for a Participant Default. 



  



30







  



10.5    Termination Payment.  In case of a Participant Default pursuant to Section 10.3, Howell may deliver a written notice terminating this Agreement (“Notice of Termination”) to Participant at any time after the expiration of the twenty (20) day cure period following delivery of the Notice of Default, in which event the Termination Payment shall be deemed to be due and payable within ten (10) days after Participant’s receipt of the Notice of Termination.  It is agreed by the Parties that any Termination Payment is not being assessed against Participant as a penalty, but only as a reasonable estimate of the damages sustained by Howell.  In the event that Participant fails to pay Howell the Termination Payment in the manner and within the time periods provided for above, Howell, in its sole discretion, may, in addition to all other legal rights and remedies, exercise a right of offset hereunder (including the right to offset against any production in the Project Area or other amounts that may be due to Participant) against any and all amounts in default under this Section X, and solely for purposes of enforcing this Section X this Agreement shall survive termination until such time as the procedures have been completed and all sums due hereunder are completely resolved and paid.

 

10.6    Cross Defaults.  The performance of the obligations, covenants, terms and conditions of this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument, or document executed or to be executed by Howell in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby to which it is a party (“Related Contracts”) shall be secured by the liens granted under the terms of the Salt Creek JOA.  Any breach or default of the obligations, covenants, terms and conditions of this Agreement or the Related Contracts shall also be a breach or default under the terms of each of the other agreements; provided, however, such breach or default shall not result in the remedies set forth under Sections 10.3 through 10.5 unless such breach or default is a Participant’s Default under Section 10.3(a).

 

10.7    Guaranty by Participant.  Participant shall provide an ultimate parent company guaranty to Howell at the Closing, in the form of Exhibit “L” (the “Parent Company Guaranty”). Any amounts paid to Howell pursuant to the Parent Company Guaranty other than Expenses (as defined therein) shall be deemed to be paid for Participant’s Commitment.

 

10.8    Effects of Termination or Expiration.  In addition to the terms and provisions of this Agreement expressly stated to survive any termination or expiration hereof, the terms and provisions of this Section 10.8 and Sections 5.2, 8.4(d), Section XIII, Section XIV, Sections 16.2, 16.3, 16.5, 16.7, 16.9, 16.11, 16.12, 16.15, 16.16, 16.18, 16.19, and 16.20, shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.

(d)           To make a claim for indemnification (“Indemnity Claim”) under Section 13 of this Agreement, an Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of its Indemnity Claim, including such specific details of and specific basis under this Section 13 of this Agreement for its Indemnity Claim as may be available to the Indemnified Party (the “Claim Notice”).  The Indemnified Party shall provide its Claim Notice promptly after the Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of the Claim for which it seeks indemnification and shall enclose a copy of formal notices (if any) served with respect to the Claim; provided, however, that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give notice of a Claim as provided in this Section 13.3 shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under Section 13 except to the extent, and only to the extent, such failure results in insufficient time being available to permit the Indemnifying Party to effectively defend against the Claim or otherwise materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party’s ability to defend against the Claim. In the event that the Indemnity Claim is based upon a breach of a covenant or agreement, the Claim Notice shall specify the covenant or agreement which was breached.

 

The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the Claim Notice to notify the Indemnified Party whether it elects to defend the Indemnified Party against the relevant Claim at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party is authorized, prior to and during such 30-day period, to file any motion, answer or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Party and that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party.

 

If the Indemnifying Party elects to indemnify the Indemnified Party, it shall have the right and obligation to diligently defend, at its sole cost and expense, the Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof. If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate in contesting any Claim which the Indemnifying Party elects to contest at the Indemnifying Party’s sole cost and expense. The Indemnified Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 13.3(d), at the Indemnified Party’s sole cost and



  



38







  



expense. An Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, (i) settle any Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto which does not include an unconditional written release of the Indemnified Party from all liability in respect of such Claim, or (ii) settle any Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto in any manner that may materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Party.

 

If the Indemnifying Party does not elect to indemnify the Indemnified Party or so elects but fails to diligently prosecute or settle the Claim, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend against the Claim at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, with counsel of the Indemnified Party’s choosing, subject to the right of the Indemnifying Party to admit its liability and assume the defense of the Claim at any time prior to settlement or final determination thereof, but only to the extent such assumption will not adversely affect the defense of such Claim. If the Indemnifying Party has not yet elected to assume the defense of a Claim, the Indemnified Party shall send written notice to the Indemnifying Party of any proposed settlement and the Indemnifying Party shall have the option for fifteen (15) days following receipt of such notice to (i) admit in writing its liability to indemnify the Indemnified Party from and against the Claim and (ii) if liability is so admitted and the amount is paid to the Indemnified Party in full, reject, in its reasonable judgment, the proposed settlement.

 

(e)           Limitation on Actions. The covenants and agreements provided for in this Section XIII shall be of no further force and effect after such covenants and agreements have been fully performed; provided, however that there shall be no termination of any bona fide Claim asserted pursuant to this Section XIII with respect to the breach of such a covenant or agreement on or before its expiration date.

 

(f)           Termination.  The indemnities shall terminate as of the termination date of each respective covenant or agreement that is subject to indemnification.

 

13.4    Environmental Review and Disclaimers.

 

(a)           The Parties acknowledge and agree that Participant has been provided the opportunity, prior to Closing, at its sole cost, risk, and expense, to conduct an environmental assessment of the Oil and Gas Interests, and has been notified of certain matters set forth on the schedules attached hereto.  Participant accepts the Assets on an AS IS, WHERE IS basis.

 

(b)           EXCEPT AS AND TO THE EXTENT EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT AND THE ASSIGNMENTS, HOWELL MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, STATUTORY OR IMPLIED, AND ANY AND ALL SUCH REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES ARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED.

 

EXCEPT AS AND TO THE EXTENT EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT AND THE ASSIGNMENTS, AND WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, HOWELL EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS, STATUTORY OR IMPLIED, AS TO (I) TITLE TO ANY OF THE ASSETS, (II) THE CONTENTS, CHARACTER OR NATURE OF ANY DESCRIPTIVE MEMORANDUM, OR ANY REPORT OF ANY PETROLEUM ENGINEERING CONSULTANT, OR ANY GEOLOGICAL OR SEISMIC DATA OR INTERPRETATION, RELATING TO THE ASSETS, (III) THE QUANTITY, QUALITY OR RECOVERABILITY OF HYDROCARBONS IN OR FROM THE ASSETS, (IV) ANY ESTIMATES OF THE VALUE OF THE ASSETS OR FUTURE REVENUES GENERATED BY THE ASSETS, (V) THE PRODUCTION OF HYDROCARBONS FROM THE ASSETS, (VI) THE MAINTENANCE, REPAIR, CONDITION, QUALITY, SUITABILITY, DESIGN OR MARKETABILITY OF THE ASSETS, OR (VII) THE 



  



39







  



CONTENT, CHARACTER OR NATURE OF ANY DESCRIPTIVE MEMORANDUM, REPORTS, BROCHURES, CHARTS OR STATEMENTS PREPARED BY THIRD PARTIES. EXCEPT AS AND TO THE EXTENT EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THE PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT AND THE ASSIGNMENTS, AND WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, HOWELL FURTHER DISCLAIMS ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS, STATUTORY OR IMPLIED, OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR CONFORMITY TO MODELS OR SAMPLES OF MATERIALS OF ANY EQUIPMENT, IT BEING EXPRESSLY UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED BY THE PARTIES HERETO THAT, WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO ANY OTHER RIGHT OR REMEDY OF PARTICIPANT EXPRESSLY PROVIDED FOR HEREUNDER, UNDER THE PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT OR IN THE ASSIGNMENTS, PARTICIPANT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE OBTAINING THE ASSETS IN THEIR PRESENT STATUS, CONDITION AND STATE OF REPAIR, “AS IS” AND “WHERE IS” WITH ALL FAULTS AND THAT PARTICIPANT HAS MADE OR CAUSED TO BE MADE SUCH INSPECTIONS AS PARTICIPANT DEEMS APPROPRIATE.

 

13.5    Conspicuousness.  The Parties agree that provisions in this Agreement in “bold” type satisfy any requirements of the “express negligence rule” and any other requirements at law or in equity that provisions be conspicuously marked or highlighted.

 

SECTION XIV.

TAXES

 

14.1    Tax Partnership Provision.  The Parties desire to jointly fund the exploration and development of the Project Area as provided herein and to treat their joint undertaking hereunder as a partnership for United States federal and state income tax purposes (the “Tax Partnership”) and agree to be bound by the tax partnership provisions (the “Tax Partnership Provisions”) attached hereto as Exhibit “N” (which such Tax Partnership Provisions of Exhibit “N” are incorporated herein, in their entirety, by reference).  Consistent therewith, the Parties each agree to report such undertaking consistent with such treatment and not elect to be excluded from the application of all or any part of the provisions of Subchapter K, Chapter 1, Subtitle A, of the Code, or similar provisions of applicable state laws.  The Tax Partnership Provisions set forth in attached Exhibit “N” shall govern for purposes of reporting the results of operations of the Tax Partnership and each Party’s distributive share thereof.  Except as otherwise provided in the Tax Partnership Provisions, the Parties further agree that their election to treat their joint undertaking as a Tax Partnership shall be irrevocable, that neither Party may cancel such status or elect any other tax status applicable to the transactions described in this Agreement, nor take any action that could cause the joint undertaking described herein to be treated as other than a partnership for tax purposes.

 

14.2    Allocation of Tax Liabilities.  Except for treatment of ad valorem Taxes, all Taxes (except state or federal income, margin and franchise Taxes) and similar obligations pertaining to the Assets are Howell’s responsibility if incurred prior to the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, all production, severance or similar Taxes shall be treated as incurred when the relevant production occurred, and any Transfer Taxes shall be treated as incurred when the transfer or other act giving rise to such Transfer Tax occurred, regardless of when such Taxes are assessed.  After the Closing Date, each Party hereto shall be responsible for its Proportionate Share of all Taxes (except state or federal income, margin and franchise Taxes) and similar obligations pertaining to the Assets.  Each Party shall also be responsible for its own state and federal income, margin and franchise Taxes, whether incurred before or after the Closing Date. After the Closing Date, each Party shall supply the other Party information and documents reasonably necessary to comply with Tax and financial reporting requirements and audits.  Ad valorem Taxes for each assessment period shall be allocated to Howell based on the percentage of the assessment 



  



40







  



period occurring before the Effective Date and to Participant based on the percentage of the assessment period occurring on or after the Effective Date.  For the avoidance of doubt, any ad valorem Tax assessed as a result of the omission of Assets from applicable ad valorem Tax rolls with respect to any period prior to the Effective Date shall be allocated to such pre-Effective Date period.  Howell shall handle payment to the appropriate Governmental Authority of all Taxes with respect to the Assets which are required to be paid prior to Closing (and shall file all Tax Returns with respect to such Taxes).

 

14.3    No Transfer Tax.  No Transfer Tax will be collected from Participant in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  If, however, any such transaction is later deemed to be subject to Transfer Tax, then Howell and Participant shall each bear one-half of such Transfer Tax.  Howell and Participant agree to cooperate with each other in demonstrating that any requirements for exemptions, if any, from such Transfer Taxes have been met.

 

14.4    Tax Covenants.

 

In connection with the operation of the Assets for the period between the Execution Date and the Closing Date, Howell agrees as follows with respect to Tax matters:

 

(a)           Howell will timely and properly file any and all Tax Returns consistently with past practice; 

 

(b)           Howell will timely pay any and all Taxes that become due;

 

(c)           Howell will not change, revoke, amend or file any Tax election or take any position on a Tax Return that is inconsistent with prior practice without the express written consent of Participant, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld;

 

(d)           Howell shall notify Participant of any notice received from a Governmental Authority with respect to Tax matters; however, with respect to ad valorem and similar Taxes, Howell shall only notify Participant of any such notice received to the extent such notice is outside the ordinary course of reasonable and prudent Tax administration as determined by Howell in its reasonable discretion; and

 

(e)           Howell will not settle any audit, dispute, or proceeding related to Tax (except state or federal income Taxes) matters or agree to any extension or waiver of any statute of limitations related to Tax (except state or federal income Tax) matters without the express written consent of Participant, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

After the Participant’s Commitment Termination Date, Participant may assign all or any portion of its interest in this Agreement, the Salt Creek JOA or the Salt Creek Unit Operating Agreement (or memorandum of such agreements) or any of its right, title or interest in any of the Leases or other EOR Properties that are subject to this Agreement, without restriction.

46

16.15   Reservation as to Non-Parties.  Nothing herein is intended to limit or otherwise waive any recourse Participant or Howell may have against any Third Parties or Persons other than Participant and Howell for any obligations or liabilities which may be incurred with respect to the Project Area or operations conducted in connection therewith.
