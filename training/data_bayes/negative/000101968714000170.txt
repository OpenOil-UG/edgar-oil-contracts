this Agreement, the Note and the Warrant and to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder. All corporate action on the part

in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the rules and regulations of the Commission with respect thereto
as in effect at the time of filing. Such financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved ("GAAP"), except as may be otherwise
specified in such financial statements or the notes thereto and except that unaudited financial statements may not contain all
footnotes required by GAAP, and fairly present in all material respects the financial position of the Company and its consolidated
subsidiaries as of and for the dates thereof and the results of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended, subject,
in the case of unaudited statements, to normal, immaterial, year-end audit adjustments.

WARRANT TO PURCHASE COMMON STOCK

WEST TEXAS RESOURCES, INC.

200,000 SHARES

VOID AFTER 5:30 P.M., HOUSTON TIME

ON THE EXPIRATION DATE

THIS WARRANT AND ANY SHARES ACQUIRED
UPON THE EXERCISE OF THIS WARRANT HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “ACT”),
AND MAY NOT BE SOLD, PLEDGED, HYPOTHECATED, DONATED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED WITHOUT COMPLIANCE WITH THE REGISTRATION OR QUALIFICATION
PROVISIONS OF APPLICABLE FEDERAL AND STATE SECURITIES LAWS OR APPLICABLE EXEMPTIONS THEREFROM.

FOR VALUE RECEIVED,
WEST TEXAS RESOURCES, INC., a Nevada corporation (the “Company”), hereby agrees to sell upon the terms and on
the conditions hereinafter set forth, but no later than 5:30 p.m., Houston Time, on the Expiration Date (as hereinafter defined)
to Lake Oswego Oil Company, LLC or registered assigns (the “Holder”), under the terms as hereinafter set forth,
Two Hundred Thousand (200,000) fully paid and non-assessable shares of the Company’s Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share
(the “Warrant Stock”), at a purchase price of Fifty Cents ($0.50) per share (the “Warrant Price”),
pursuant to this warrant (this “Warrant”). The number of shares of Warrant Stock to be so issued and the Warrant
Price are subject to adjustment in certain events as hereinafter set forth. The term “Common Stock” shall mean, when
used herein, unless the context otherwise requires, the stock and other securities and property at the time receivable upon the
exercise of this Warrant.

1.            Exercise of Warrant.

a.             
The Holder may
exercise this Warrant according to its terms by surrendering this Warrant to the Company at the address set forth in Section 9,
the Notice of Exercise attached hereto having then been duly executed by the Holder, accompanied by cash, certified check or bank
draft in payment of the purchase price, in lawful money of the United States of America, for the number of shares of the Warrant
Stock specified in the Notice of Exercise, or as otherwise provided in this Warrant, any time and prior to 5:30 p.m., Houston Time,
on September 5, 2015 (the “Expiration Date”).

b.             
Notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, the Holder may, in its sole discretion, exercise this Warrant in whole or in part by
means of a “cashless exercise” in lieu of making a cash payment, and the Holder shall then be entitled to receive a
certificate for the number of shares of Warrant Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing [(A-B) (X)] by (A), where:


(A)   = VWAP (as defined below) on the business day immediately preceding the date of such
election;





    1
     
    

 


(B)   = the Warrant Price of this Warrant, as adjusted; and



(X)   =the number of shares of Warrant Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant in
accordance with the terms of this Warrant by means of a cash exercise rather than a cashless exercise.


 

For purposes of
this Warrant, “VWAP” means, for any date, the price determined by the first of the following clauses that applies:
(a) if the Common Stock is then listed or quoted on a Trading Market (as defined below), the daily volume weighted average price
of the Common Stock for the ten (10) trading days prior to such date (or the nearest preceding date) on the Trading Market on which
the Common Stock is then listed or quoted as reported by Bloomberg L.P. (based on a Trading Day from 9:30 a.m. New York City time
to 4:02 p.m. New York City time); (b) if the OTC Bulletin Board is not a Trading Market, the volume weighted average price of the
Common Stock for the ten (10) trading days prior to such date (or the nearest preceding date) on the OTC Bulletin Board or OTC
Market; (c) if the Common Stock is not then listed or quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or OTC Market and if prices for the Common
Stock are then reported in the “Pink Sheets” published by Pink Sheets, LLC (or a similar organization or agency succeeding
to its functions of reporting prices), the average bid price per share of the Common Stock so reported for the twenty (20) trading
days prior to such date; or (d) in all other cases, the fair market value of a share of Common Stock as determined in good faith
by the Company’s board of directors. For purposes of this Warrant, “Trading Market” means the following markets
or exchanges on which the Common Stock is listed or quoted for trading on the date in question: the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE
MKT, NASDAQ Capital Market, NASDAQ Global Market, NASDAQ Global Select Market, OTC Bulletin Board or OTC Market.

c.             
This Warrant
may be exercised in whole or in part so long as any exercise in part hereof would not involve the issuance of fractional shares
of Warrant Stock. If exercised in part, the Company shall deliver to the Holder a new Warrant, identical in form, in the name of
the Holder, evidencing the right to purchase the number of shares of Warrant Stock as to which this Warrant has not been exercised,
which new Warrant shall be signed by the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer or President and the Secretary or Assistant Secretary
of the Company. The term Warrant as used herein shall include any subsequent Warrant issued as provided herein.

d.             
No fractional
shares or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the exercise of this Warrant. The Company shall pay cash in
lieu of fractions with respect to the Warrants based upon the fair market value of such fractional shares of Common Stock (which
shall be the closing price of such shares on the exchange or market on which the Common Stock is then traded) at the time of exercise
of this Warrant.

e.             
In the event
of any exercise of the rights represented by this Warrant, a certificate or certificates for the Warrant Stock so purchased, registered
in the name of the Holder, shall be delivered to the Holder within a reasonable time after such rights shall have been so exercised.
The person or entity in whose name any certificate for the Warrant Stock is issued upon exercise of the rights represented by this
Warrant shall for all purposes be deemed to have become the holder of record of such shares immediately prior to the close of business
on the date on which the Warrant was surrendered and payment of the Warrant Price and any applicable taxes was made, irrespective
of the date of delivery of such certificate, except that, if the date of such surrender and payment is a date when the stock transfer
books of the Company are closed, such person shall be deemed to have become the holder of such shares at the opening of business
on the next succeeding date on which the stock transfer books are open. The Company shall pay any and all documentary stamp or
similar issue or transfer taxes payable in respect of the issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock on exercise of this Warrant.


    2
     
    



2.            Disposition
of Warrant Stock and Warrant.

a.             
The Holder hereby
acknowledges that this Warrant and any Warrant Stock purchased pursuant hereto are, as of the date hereof, not registered: (i)
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”), on the ground that the issuance of this Warrant is exempt
from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Act as not involving any public offering or (ii) under any applicable state securities
law because the issuance of this Warrant does not involve any public offering; and that the Company’s reliance on the Section
4(a)(2) exemption of the Act and under applicable state securities laws is predicated in part on the representations hereby made
to the Company by the Holder that it is acquiring this Warrant and will acquire the Warrant Stock for investment for its own account,
with no present intention of dividing its participation with others or reselling or otherwise distributing the same, subject, nevertheless,
to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property shall at all times be within its control.

The Holder hereby
agrees that it will not sell or transfer all or any part of this Warrant and/or Warrant Stock unless and until it shall first have
given notice to the Company describing such sale or transfer and furnished to the Company either (i) an opinion, reasonably satisfactory
to counsel for the Company, of counsel (skilled in securities matters, selected by the Holder and reasonably satisfactory to the
Company) to the effect that the proposed sale or transfer may be made without registration under the Act and without registration
or qualification under any state law, or (ii) an interpretative letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission to the effect
that no enforcement action will be recommended if the proposed sale or transfer is made without registration under the Act.

b.             
The Company
may at its election require that the Holder provide the Company with written reconfirmation of the Holder’s investment intent
and that any stock certificate delivered to the Holder of a surrendered Warrant shall bear legends reading substantially as follows:

“THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY
THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AND MAY NOT BE SOLD, TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE
DISPOSED OF IN THE ABSENCE OF AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 OR AN OPINION OF COUNSEL SATISFACTORY
TO THE ISSUER OF THIS CERTIFICATE THAT REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER SAID ACT.”

In addition, so long as the foregoing
legend may remain on any stock certificate delivered to the Holder, the Company may maintain appropriate “stop transfer”
orders with respect to such certificates and the shares represented thereby on its books and records and with those to whom it
may delegate registrar and transfer functions.


    3
     
    



3.            Reservation
of Shares. The Company hereby agrees that at all times there shall be reserved for issuance upon the exercise of this Warrant
such number of shares of its Common Stock as shall be required for issuance upon exercise of this Warrant. The Company further
agrees that all shares which may be issued upon the exercise of the rights represented by this Warrant will be duly authorized
and will, upon issuance and against payment of the exercise price, be validly issued, fully paid and non assessable, free from
all taxes, liens, charges and preemptive rights with respect to the issuance thereof, other than taxes, if any, in respect of
any transfer occurring contemporaneously with such issuance and other than transfer restrictions imposed by federal and state
securities laws.

4.            Exchange,
Transfer or Assignment of Warrant. This Warrant is exchangeable, without expense, at the option of the Holder, upon presentation
and surrender hereof to the Company or at the office of its stock transfer agent, if any, for other Warrants of different denominations,
entitling the Holder or Holders thereof to purchase in the aggregate the same number of shares of Common Stock purchasable hereunder.
Upon surrender of this Warrant to the Company or at the office of its stock transfer agent, if any, with the Assignment Form annexed
hereto duly executed and funds sufficient to pay any transfer tax, the Company shall, without charge, execute and deliver a new
Warrant in the name of the assignee named in such instrument of assignment and this Warrant shall promptly be canceled. This Warrant
may be divided or combined with other Warrants that carry the same rights upon presentation hereof at the office of the Company
or at the office of its stock transfer agent, if any, together with a written notice specifying the names and denominations in
which new Warrants are to be issued and signed by the Holder hereof.

5.            Capital Adjustments. This Warrant
is subject to the following further provisions:

a.             
Recapitalization,
Reclassification and Succession. If any recapitalization of the Company or reclassification of its Common Stock or any merger
or consolidation of the Company into or with a corporation or other business entity, or the sale or transfer of all or substantially
all of the Company’s assets or of any successor corporation’s assets to any other corporation or business entity (any
such corporation or other business entity being included within the meaning of the term “successor corporation”) shall
be effected, at any time while this Warrant remains outstanding and unexpired, then, as a condition of such recapitalization, reclassification,
merger, consolidation, sale or transfer, lawful and adequate provision shall be made whereby the Holder of this Warrant thereafter
shall have the right to receive upon the exercise hereof as provided in Section 1 and in lieu of the shares of Common Stock immediately
theretofore issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant, such shares of capital stock, securities or other property as may be issued
or payable with respect to or in exchange for a number of outstanding shares of Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Common
Stock immediately theretofore issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant had such recapitalization, reclassification, merger, consolidation,
sale or transfer not taken place, and in each such case, the terms of this Warrant shall be applicable to the shares of stock or
other securities or property receivable upon the exercise of this Warrant after such consummation.

b.             
Subdivision
or Combination of Shares. If the Company at any time while this Warrant remains outstanding and unexpired shall subdivide
or combine its Common Stock, the number of shares of Warrant Stock purchasable upon exercise of this Warrant and the Warrant Price
shall be proportionately adjusted.


    4
     
    



c.             
Stock Dividends
and Distributions. If the Company at any time while this Warrant is outstanding and unexpired shall issue or pay the holders
of its Common Stock, or take a record of the holders of its Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive, a dividend
payable in, or other distribution of, Common Stock, then (i) the Warrant Price shall be adjusted in accordance with Section 5(e)
and (ii) the number of shares of Warrant Stock purchasable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be adjusted to the number of shares
of Common Stock that the Holder would have owned immediately following such action had this Warrant been exercised immediately
prior thereto.

d.             
Stock and Rights
Offering to Shareholders. If the Company shall at any time after the date of issuance of this Warrant distribute to all holders
of its Common Stock any shares of capital stock of the Company (other than Common Stock) or evidences of its indebtedness or assets
(excluding cash dividends or distributions paid from retained earnings or current year’s or prior year’s earnings
of the Company) or rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any of its securities (excluding those referred to in the immediately
preceding paragraph) (any of the foregoing being hereinafter in this paragraph called the “Securities”), then in each
such case, the Company shall reserve shares or other units of such Securities for distribution to the Holder upon exercise of
this Warrant so that, in addition to the shares of the Common Stock to which such Holder is entitled, such Holder will receive
upon such exercise the amount and kind of such Securities which such Holder would have received if the Holder had, immediately
prior to the record date for the distribution of the Securities, exercised this Warrant.

e.             
Warrant Price
Adjustment. Except as otherwise provided herein, whenever the number of shares of Warrant Stock purchasable upon exercise of

Re:      Amendment to Secured Promissory Note

 

Dear Mr. Hamersly:

We are writing with respect
to that certain Secured Promissory Note (“Note”) dated September 5, 2013 in the original principal amount of $100,000
made by West Texas Resources, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Maker”), in favor of Lake Oswego Oil Company, LLC, an Oregon
limited liability company (“Lender”). All capitalized terms used in this Letter Agreement which are not otherwise defined
herein shall have the same meaning given to them in the Note.

 

Maker and Lender have discussed
the merits of extending the present maturity date of the Note by four months. To that end, this will confirm our agreement to amend
the Note by providing that all references to the term “Maturity Date”, as set forth in the Note, shall mean March 5,
2014. This will also confirm that you are waiving any breach under the Note by Maker for not having made the required payments
under the Note as of or following the original due date of November 5, 2013.

 

If this Letter Agreement
appropriately reflects our agreement, please sign in the location provided below at which time this Letter Agreement will formally
amend the Note as provided herein. Except as provided herein, all other terms and conditions of the Note shall remain in effect
and unmodified by this Letter Agreement.

 

Very truly yours,

 

 

/s/ Stephen E. Jones

Stephen E. Jones,

Chief Executive Officer
