ARTICLE V 
TITLE MATTERS; CASUALTY; CONSENTS  5.1 Title. Except for Sellers Warranties, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates makes any representation or warranty, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to
Sellers title to any of the Assets, except by, through and under Seller and its Affiliates, but not otherwise, and Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that Buyer has no claim or remedy against Seller or its Affiliates, or their respective
successors or assigns, for any defect of title relating to the Assets, including but not limited to any lien, encumbrance, claim, defect in or object to real property title, and the existence or non-existence of any leases, easements or
rights-of-way, except those claims or rights against the Assets that arise by, through and under Seller and its Affiliates, but not otherwise.  5.2 Casualty Loss. If (a) a portion of the Assets is damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty prior to Closing (Casualty Loss) and such Casualty Loss is
not a Major Casualty Loss, or (b) such Casualty Loss is a Major Casualty Loss but neither Seller nor Buyer elect to terminate this Agreement as permitted in this Section 5.2, then (i) this Agreement will remain in full force
and effect and the Parties shall proceed to close the Transaction, without adjustment or reduction to the Purchase Price, (ii) the insurance proceeds shall be paid to Seller to be used and applied as provided in the Lease, and (iii) Seller
will commence to repair, restore and/or replace the Assets or part thereof damaged or destroyed by such fire or other casualty as soon as reasonably practicable to substantially the same condition as immediately prior to the Casualty Loss and in a
manner consistent with the applicable provisions of the Lease (the Restoration Operations), (iv) if the Restoration Operations cannot be completed prior to the

   13 






 
Closing Date but can be completed prior to the Outside Closing Date, the Closing Date shall be automatically extended until the Restoration Operations are complete (but not beyond the Outside
Closing Date), and (v) if the Major Casualty Notice indicates that the Restoration Operations cannot be completed by the Outside Closing Date and neither Seller or Buyer terminates the Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.2, then
the Outside Closing Date shall be automatically extended until the estimated completion date for the Restoration Operations as set forth in the Major Casualty Notice. If Seller determines in good faith that either (A) the Casualty Loss is
greater than Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000), or (B) the casualty cannot be repaired, restored or replaced prior to the Outside Closing Date (each, a Major Casualty Loss), Seller shall so notify Buyer in
writing (Major Casualty Notice), and either Seller or Buyer may elect to terminate this Agreement by giving written notice of termination to the other Party within five (5) Business Days following the date of
Sellers Major Casualty Notice. Upon any such termination, neither Seller nor Buyer shall have any further rights or obligations hereunder except those which expressly survive termination. Seller shall consult with Buyer regarding any Casualty
Loss in excess of Two Million ($2,000,000.00) and consider in good faith any input from Buyer as to whether such Casualty Loss is a Major Casualty Loss prior to making any determination in respect thereof. 
5.3 Consents.  (a) Buyer and Seller acknowledge that BLM consent to the assignment of a right of way or easement from BLM is customarily not requested or obtained until after the closing of the actual assignment of such
right of way or easement. Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts after Closing to obtain the BLM Consent, through submission of the BLM Request for Consent to Assignment to Buyer in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B,
with such changes to such form as may be required by changes in applicable law or regulations after the Effective Date. Buyer shall pay any costs or expenses assessed by BLM in connection with such BLM Request for Consent to Assignment to Buyer.
 (b) Prior to Closing, Seller shall request of the BLM that the BLM Easement issued under the Federal Land Policy Management
Act be converted to a right-of-way under the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 (or issue a new right-of-way under the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 covering the same lands for the same purposes). If such conversion (or new issuance) is not completed by
September 1, 2013, Seller shall, as expeditiously as possible, either (i) obtain the written approval of the BLM to Lessees use of such BLM Easement pursuant to the Lease, or (ii) obtain an amendment to such BLM Easement to
allow such use and the sublease thereof. Such September 1, 2013, date may be extended by Buyer if Seller has demonstrated to Buyers reasonable satisfaction that the conversion (or new issuance) is imminent. Seller shall, as expeditiously
as possible, take all action the BLM deems necessary or appropriate (including making any such filings, providing such information, materials and documentation and obtaining such approvals, consents and other action as is necessary or appropriate)
in connection with the transfer of the BLM Easements to Buyer, the lease of the BLM Easements by Lessee pursuant to the Lease, and the use of such BLM Easements by Lessee pursuant thereto. For purposes of this Agreement, the term Other
BLM Matters means the issues, matters and obligations under this Section 5.3(b). 
   14 






 (c) Except for the BLM Consent and the Other BLM Matters, if prior to Closing Seller or
Buyer discovers a consent necessary for the valid assignment of the Assets, or a portion thereof, required by either (a) the contract or agreement granting or creating Sellers rights in an Asset component (other than a consent to
assignment of the Records or any part of the Records, which shall not be considered an Additional Required Consent) or (b) a law applicable to the transfer of an Asset component from Seller to Buyer hereunder (other than the BLM Request for
Consent to Assignment to Buyer) (each, and except for the BLM Consent and the Other BLM Matters (which are governed by subsections (a) and (b), above), an Additional Required Consent) such Party shall
promptly notify the other of the need for such Additional Required Consent, the Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such Additional Required Consent, and Buyer shall cooperate (without any obligation on Buyers part to
make any payments or incur any liabilities) with Seller in a commercially reasonable manner. In connection with Sellers efforts to acquire any Additional Required Consent, commercially reasonable efforts may include the payment of
reasonable costs and expenses in connection therewith. Unless and until any such Additional Required Consent is obtained, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Parties will cooperate in good faith to establish an arrangement reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer and Seller under which Buyer would obtain the claims, rights and benefits associated with the Assets (or portion thereof) affected by such Additional Required Consents (the Non-Assignable Assets) and
under which Seller would enforce for the benefit of Buyer any and all claims, rights and benefits of Seller associated with the Non-Assignable Assets against a third party thereto. Nothing in this Section 5.3 shall be deemed to
constitute an agreement by Buyer to exclude from the Assets any of the Non-Assignable Assets. Seller will convey such Non-Assignable Assets to Buyer promptly upon receipt of the requisite Additional Required Consents with the Closing Date for such
Non-Assignable Assets being adjusted appropriately, but subject in all other respects to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Buyer and Seller agree, upon the request and at the expense of Buyer, to use commercially reasonable efforts to
acquire consent to the assignment of any of the Records for which consent to assignment is required.  5.4 Nerd Farm
Mortgage and Nerd Farm Judgment. For each of the Nerd Farm Mortgage and the Nerd Farm Judgment, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain prior to Closing either (a) a subordination to the Nerd Farm Easement, (b) a
release, or (c) agreement of the Title Company to issue to Buyer the Nerd Farm Title Policy without exception for the Nerd Farm Mortgage and Nerd Farm Judgment. Upon receipt of any release or subordination, Seller shall cause such releases and
subordinations to be recorded in the applicable public records of Sublette County, Wyoming.  ARTICLE VI 
CONFIDENTIALITY  6.1 No Disclosure or Use of Confidential Information. Except as permitted in this Agreement, each Party agrees not to disclose the Confidential Information to any other Person not having a need to

Confidential Information to its Representatives; provided that each Party shall obtain an agreement from such Representatives to abide by the Confidentiality Provisions. 
   15 






 6.2 Compelled and Anticipated Disclosure.

treated confidentially, (c) notify the Disclosing Party as promptly as possible of the request for disclosure and the items of Confidential Information to be disclosed; and (d) if requested by Disclosing Party, reasonably cooperate with
the Disclosing Party, at the Disclosing Partys expense, in the Disclosing Partys efforts to limit disclosure of such Confidential Information.  (b) The Parties acknowledge: (i) that Tortoise Capital Resources Corporation changed its name to CorEnergy and CorEnergy will conduct a public offering of its common stock to partially finance
the Transaction and (ii) that the public offering will require or make appropriate the public disclosure of certain Confidential Information. In addition, the Parties acknowledge that CorEnergy is subject to the reporting obligations of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 34 Act) and, as a result, it will be required or appropriate that CorEnergy make public disclosure of certain Confidential Information on a periodic basis. Further, the Parties
acknowledge that the partners of Buyer will be entitled, under state partnership law and Buyers partnership agreement, to access to certain Confidential Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties agree that neither Buyer nor
CorEnergy shall, under any circumstance contemplated in this subparagraph (b), disclose any Proprietary Information in any securities law filing or to any Person who is a Disqualified Person as that term is defined in the Lease.
 6.3 Ownership and Return. All Confidential Information will remain the property of the Disclosing Party, and no
right or license is granted to the Recipient Party with respect to any Confidential Information. Except as explicitly noted in Section 13.3(f), nothing in this Agreement creates an agency or partnership relationship between the Parties.
Upon the request of the Disclosing Party, the Recipient Party agrees to (a) immediately return to the Disclosing Party or destroy all Confidential Information, including copies of the same, and (b) destroy any memoranda, summaries,
reports, documents or analyses created by the Recipient Party that contain or are based in any way on the Confidential Information. Upon the Disclosing Partys request, the fact of any such destruction must be certified in writing to the
Disclosing Party by an officer of the Recipient Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Recipient Party is required by federal securities laws to retain certain records, nothing herein shall prevent the Recipient Party from complying
with its ordinary records retention policy, and each Recipient Party may retain Confidential Information contained or reflected in materials presented to its board of directors, to the extent required by law, or which would be unreasonably
burdensome for it to destroy (such as archived computer records).  6.4 Standstill. The Recipient Party agrees that
while it is in possession of material nonpublic information concerning the Disclosing Party, it will not purchase, sell or otherwise engage in any transaction in or related to the securities of: (a) the Disclosing Party, or (b) any entity
in which the Disclosing Party has invested or advises and that is the subject of any of the Confidential Information. Each Party confirms that it is familiar with federal and state securities laws concerning material non-public information. Each
Party hereby confirms that it will not use the Confidential Information in any manner inconsistent with those laws. 
   16 






 6.5 Attorneys Fees. Notwithstanding anything set forth in this Agreement to the
contrary, if the Disclosing Party commences a lawsuit or other proceeding against the Recipient Party under this Article VI and successfully enforces any of the provisions of this Article VI or on account of any damages sustained by
the Disclosing Party by reason of the Recipient Partys proven violation of any provisions of this Article VI, the Recipient Party agrees that it will pay, in addition to other costs and damages, the Disclosing Partys reasonable
attorneys fees.  6.6 Announcements. Seller and Buyer shall consult with each other with regard to, and shall
jointly review prior to issuance, all press releases and other announcements issued on or after the Effective Date concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby so as to ensure consistency of description of the Transaction.
 6.7 Injunctive Relief. Notwithstanding anything set forth in this Agreement to the contrary, the Recipient Party
agrees that if it breaches any provision of this Article VI, the Disclosing Party may suffer irreparable damages and its remedy at law may be inadequate. Therefore, if the Recipient Party breaches this Agreement, the Disclosing Party will be
entitled, in addition to the damages provided for in Section 6.5, above, and all other remedies available to it at law or in equity, to seek equitable relief, including specific performance and injunctive relief to enforce any provision
hereof and to restrain the Recipient Party from using or disclosing, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, any Confidential Information.  6.8 Survival. The Parties shall comply with this Article VI until Closing. The actions of the Parties with respect to Confidential Information after Closing shall be governed by the
provisions of the Lease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the rights of the Parties to enforce the provisions of this Article VI for actions taken prior to Closing shall survive Closing. If, for any reason, this Agreement is terminated and
Closing does not occur, the provisions of this Article VI shall survive termination of this Agreement for a period of twelve (12) months following the date of such termination.

Ultra Resources or both of them deem beneficial to Seller and/or Ultra Resources. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, however, Seller agrees that, during the Interim Period, without the prior written consent of Buyer, Seller shall:
 (i) Not sell, transfer, lease, encumber, or create a Lien on, exchange, or otherwise dispose of any of the
Assets (other than the sale of worn-out or obsolete equipment, spare parts, or minor or insignificant Assets) in a manner which would cause Sellers Warranties under Section 7.14 hereof to be untrue or incorrect;

and operation of the Assets in the ordinary course and in a manner consistent with past practices;  (iii) not
grant in favor of any Person a preferential purchase right to purchase any Assets;  (iv) not remove from the

Lease or the Equity Investors Agreement with respect to Buyer or its direct or indirect owners or its Affiliates upon execution of the Lease and the Equity Investors Agreement at Closing. During the Interim Period, upon acquiring knowledge thereof,
Buyer shall promptly notify Seller of any events or circumstances which would cause any of Buyers Warranties to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect.  9.4 Further Assurances.

Seller with respect to any of such covenants and agreements, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived each such breach and any and all rights and remedies in connection therewith. If Seller first learns of the breach prior to Closing, Sellers
remedies shall be governed solely and exclusively by Section 11.1. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event Seller elects to proceed to Closing notwithstanding Sellers knowledge of the existence of a

Property Taxes means all ad valorem and property taxes and obligations assessed by a Taxing Authority against the Assets or based upon the ownership of the Assets, but excluding income, franchise or similar taxes. All Property Taxes
assessed against the Assets shall be prorated between Buyer and Seller as of the end of the Closing Date for all taxable periods that include the Closing Date. Accordingly, (a) Buyer shall be responsible for all Property Taxes assessed against
the Assets that are attributable to the period of time after the Closing Date and (b) Seller shall be responsible for all Property Taxes assessed against the Assets that are attributable to the period of time prior to and ending on the Closing
Date. Such proration shall, initially, be based on the most recent Property Tax statements received by Seller or available from the applicable taxing authority as of the Closing Date. Following the Closing Date, each Party shall, upon request of the
other Party, immediately reimburse the other Party for any such Property Taxes for which said Party is responsible but have been paid by the other Party.

applicable law, Seller shall, in accordance with applicable law, calculate and remit any sales or similar taxes that are required to be paid as a result of the transfer of the Assets to Buyer and Buyer shall promptly reimburse Seller therefor. If
Seller receives notice that any sales and/or use taxes are due, Seller shall promptly forward such notice to Buyer for handling.  10.4 Federal Tax Reporting. Buyer and Seller will comply, to the extent required pursuant to the procedural requirements of Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder, with respect to the allocation of the Purchase Price among the Assets. Buyer and Seller agree that they will not take any Tax position inconsistent with allocations made in this Agreement, if any; provided, however, that
(a) Buyers cost for the Assets may differ from the total amount allocated thereunder to reflect Buyers capitalized transaction costs so allocated, and (b) Sellers amount realized on the sale of the Assets may differ from
the total amount so allocated to reflect Sellers transaction costs that reduce the amount realized. The Parties will promptly inform one another of any challenge by any Taxing Authority to any allocation made pursuant to this
Section 10.4 and agree to consult and keep one another informed with respect to the status of, and any discussion, proposal or submission with respect to, such challenge. 
10.5 Like Kind Exchange. Seller may desire to have its transfer of one or more of the Assets to Buyer qualify as a deferred like
kind exchange within the meaning of Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Further, either Seller or Buyer may desire to effectuate a deferred like kind exchange through the use of an intermediary in the manner
described in Treas. Reg. Section 1.031(k)1(g)(8), example 4 or other applicable provisions. Each party shall reasonably cooperate with the other Party in effectuating such a deferred like kind exchange through the use of such an intermediary,
including consenting to an assignment of any or all of the exchanging Partys rights under this Agreement to an intermediary. Such other Party, however, shall have no obligation to locate, contract for or take title to any property that the
exchanging Party may wish to buy or to incur any cost, expense, indebtedness, liability or other obligation of any kind as a part of such other Partys agreement to reasonably cooperate.

   32 






 (e) The provisions of Sections 14.3(a)(ii), (c) and (d),
14.4, 14.5, 14.6, 14.7, 14.8, 14.9 and 14.10 shall survive termination of this Agreement and Closing without limitation.  14.5 Procedure. The indemnifications contained in this Article XIV shall be implemented as follows:  (a) Claim Notice. The Party seeking indemnification under the terms of this Agreement (Indemnified Party) shall submit a written Claim
Notice to the other Party (Indemnifying Party) which, to be effective, must state: (i) the amount of each payment claimed by an Indemnified Party to be owing, (ii) the basis for such claim, with
supporting documentation, and (iii) a list identifying to the extent reasonably possible each separate item of Loss for which payment is so claimed. The amount claimed shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party to the extent required herein within
30 days after receipt of the Claim Notice, or after the amount of such payment has been finally established, whichever last occurs; provided, however, that any objection to the Claim Notice by the Indemnifying Party must be provided to the
Indemnified Party within 15 days of receipt of the Claim Notice and any undisputed portion of the Claim paid within 30 days of receipt of the Claim Notice, or the Indemnifying Party waives its right to protest the Claim. 
(b) Information. Within 60 days after the Indemnified Party receives notice of a claim or legal action that may result in a
Loss for which indemnification may be sought under this Agreement (a Claim), the Indemnified Party shall give written notice of such Claim to the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party or its counsel so requests, the
Indemnified Party shall furnish the Indemnifying Party with copies of all pleadings and other information with respect to such Claim. At the election of the Indemnifying Party made within 60 days after receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party
shall permit the Indemnifying Party to assume control of such Claim (to the extent only that such Claim, legal action or other matter relates to a Loss for which the Indemnifying Party is liable), including the determination of all appropriate
actions, the negotiation of settlements on behalf of the Indemnified Party, and the conduct of litigation through attorneys of the Indemnifying Partys choice. No settlement of a Claim can result in any liability or cost to the Indemnified
Party for which it is entitled to be indemnified hereunder without its consent. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume control, (i) any expense incurred by the Indemnifying Party thereafter for investigation or defense of the matter shall
be borne by the Indemnifying Party, and (ii) the Indemnified Party shall give all reasonable information and assistance, other than pecuniary, that the Indemnifying Party shall deem necessary to the proper defense of such Claim, legal action,
or other matter. In the absence of such an election to assume control by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party will use commercially reasonable efforts to defend, at the Indemnifying Partys expense, any claim, legal action or other
matter to which such other Partys indemnification under this Article XIV applies until the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, and, if the Indemnifying Party fails to assume such defense within the time period provided above,
settle the same in the Indemnified Partys reasonable discretion at the Indemnifying Partys expense. If such a Claim requires immediate action, the Parties agree to cooperate in good faith to take appropriate action so as not to
jeopardize defense of such Claim or either Partys position with respect to such Claim. 
   33 






 14.6 No Insurance; Subrogation. The indemnifications provided in this Agreement shall
not be construed as a form of insurance. Buyer and Seller hereby waive for themselves, their successors or assigns including, without limitation, any insurers, any rights to subrogation for Losses for which each of them is respectively liable or
against which each respectively indemnifies the other, and, if required by applicable policies, Buyer and Seller shall obtain waiver of such subrogation from their respective insurers. 
14.7 Reservation as to Non-Parties. Nothing herein is intended to limit or otherwise waive any recourse Buyer or Seller may have
against any Person not a Party to this Agreement for any obligations or liabilities that may be incurred with respect to the Assets. For purposes of this Section 14.7 only, Ultra Resources and CorEnergy shall be deemed to be Parties to
this Agreement.  14.8 Consequential Damages. Notwithstanding anything set forth in this Agreement, Buyer and Seller, on
behalf of themselves and their respective Affiliates, expressly waive any and all rights to consequential, special, incidental, punitive, or exemplary damages and loss of profits resulting from a breach of this Agreement, including under or with
respect to any indemnifications required hereby, and agree that the indemnifications set forth herein shall not include or cover any consequential, special, incidental, punitive, or exemplary damages or loss of profits. Nothing in this
Section 14.8 shall constitute a waiver by any Party to a claim under this Article XIV with respect to diminution in value to the extent diminution in value is expressly included in the definition of the Losses covered by the
Section of this Article under which the claim is made.  14.9 No Derivative Liability. Notwithstanding anything set
forth in this Agreement, the Closing Deliveries or otherwise, no direct or indirect (through tiered ownership or otherwise) advisor, trustee, director, officer, employee, beneficiary, shareholder, participant, partner, member, owner, investor,
representative or agent of a Party or its applicable Affiliates shall have any personal liability, directly or indirectly, under or in connection with this Agreement or any Closing Deliveries or any amendment or amendments to any of the foregoing
made at any time or times, heretofore or hereafter, and the other Party and its successors and assigns and, without limitation, all other persons and entities, shall look solely to the assets of such Party (or, if expressly applicable, the assets of
such Partys Affiliate) for the payment of any claim or for any performance, and each other Party, on behalf of itself and its successors and assigns, hereby waive any and all such personal liability. Nothing in this Section 14.9 is
intended or shall be deemed to impair or limit the liability of any Person under the Seller PSA Guaranty, the Buyer PSA Guaranty, the Lessee Lease Guaranty, the Resources Guaranty or the Lessor Lease Guaranty. 
14.10 Attorneys Fees. If it shall be necessary for any Party to this Agreement to employ an attorney to enforce its rights
pursuant to this Agreement, the non-prevailing Party shall reimburse the prevailing Party for its reasonable attorneys fees and the reasonable attorneys fees of the prevailing Partys applicable Affiliates, if any, in such
proceeding.  ARTICLE XV  MISCELLANEOUS  15.1 Expenses. Except as otherwise specifically
provided, all fees, costs and expenses incurred by Buyer or Seller in negotiating this Agreement or in consummating the Transaction shall be paid by the Party incurring the same, including without limitation, engineering, land, title, legal and
accounting fees, costs and expenses. This Section 15.1 shall survive termination of this Agreement and Closing.

 FIRST AMENDMENT TO 
LIQUIDS GATHERING SYSTEM  SUBLETTE COUNTY, WYOMING  PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT 
This First Amendment to Liquids Gathering System Sublette County, Wyoming Purchase and Sale Agreement (this
Amendment) is made as of December 12, 2012 (Effective Date), by and between ULTRA WYOMING, INC., a Wyoming corporation (Seller) whose address is 400 N.
Sam Houston Parkway E., Suite 1200, Houston, Texas 77060, and PINEDALE CORRIDOR, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (Buyer) whose address is 4200 W. 115th Street, Suite 210, Leawood, Kansas 66211. Seller and Buyer may be referred to individually as a
Party or collectively as the Parties.  RECITALS 
The Parties have entered into a Liquids Gathering System Sublette County, Wyoming Purchase and Sale Agreement dated as of
December 7, 2012 (the Agreement) pursuant to which Buyer agreed to purchase, and Seller agreed to sell and convey, the Assets.  Section 3.1 of the Agreement provides that Buyer agrees to pay to Seller the Purchase Price at Closing in Current Funds.  The Parties desire to amend Section 3.1 of the Agreement and make certain additional representations and warranties and agreements, as set forth herein. 
AGREEMENT 
In consideration of the mutual promises, covenants and warranties contained herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Buyer and Seller agree as follows.  1. The Second Sentence of
Section 3.1 of the Agreement shall be deleted and replaced with the following: If the transaction contemplated by the Transaction Documents (Transaction) closes, Buyer agrees to pay to Seller the Purchase Price
at Closing as follows: (i) $205,000,000 in Current Funds; and (ii) the transfer to Seller of 1,050,420 common units of NGL Energy Partners, LP (the Units) currently held by Buyer, free of any Liens or
encumbrances.  2. Seller acknowledges that the Units are restricted securities under the federal securities
law and are, as a result, currently subject to limitations on transfer. Seller further acknowledges that the Units are currently held in book entry form and, when certificated, will bear a legend reflecting the foregoing restrictions on
transfer. 3. Buyer is the sole record and beneficial owner of the Units, and owns the Units free and clear of all Liens
and encumbrances. Upon delivery of certificates representing the Units, duly endorsed for transfer to Seller as contemplated by Section 4 of this Amendment, Seller will become the owner of the Units, free and clear of any Liens and
encumbrances created by Buyer. Buyer acquired the Units on June 19, 2012, in a transaction not involving a public 
   1 





 
offering (as defined in the Securities Act), and paid the full consideration for the Units on June 19, 2012. Buyer is not an affiliate (as used in Rule 144 under the Securities Act) of the
issuer of the Units. Buyer has not entered into, and is not bound by, any contractual provisions or agreements which limit or otherwise restrict or condition the right of Buyer to sell, assign or transfer the Units, except for restrictions imposed
by the Securities Act.  4. At and prior to the closing, Buyer and Seller cooperate in good faith and shall take such
steps as are necessary to transfer ownership of the Units from Seller to Buyer.  5. Section 13.1 is amended to
provide that the Closing Date shall be December 20, 2012, or on such other date as Buyer and Seller mutually agree in writing.  6. Unless otherwise defined herein, all capitalized terms used in this Amendment shall have the same meanings as set forth in the Agreement. 
7. Except as modified and amended by this Amendment, the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and its terms are hereby
ratified and confirmed.  Executed as of the Effective Date.
