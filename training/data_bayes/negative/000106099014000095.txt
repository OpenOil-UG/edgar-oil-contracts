Letterhead]April 16, 2014David Rushford[Address redacted]Dear Dave,Quicksilver Resources Inc. (the “Company”) previously sent you two letters, both dated July 15, 2013, one of which set forth the terms of a retention bonus awarded to you (the “Retention Letter”) and the other of which set forth the terms of a bonus in connection with a successful completion of a Horn River Basin transaction (the “Horn River Letter,” together with the Retention Letter, the “Letters”).  As indicated in the Retention Letter, the aggregate value of the retention bonus was $500,000 CDN, 50% of which was awarded in the form of cash and 50% in the form of a stock option award.  Likewise, as indicated in the Horn River Letter, the aggregate value of the Horn River bonus was $500,000 CDN, 50% of which would be awarded in the form of cash and 50% in the form of a stock option award.In determining the number of shares of the Company underlying the two stock option awards described above, a calculation error related to currency conversion was made.  As a result, each Letter indicated that the applicable stock option award would be with respect to 250,000 shares of the Company.  However, each Letter should have stated that the applicable stock option award was with respect to 240,075 shares of the Company, a number of shares that results in a stock option award with a value of $250,000 CDN.This letter acts to correct each of the Letters, as well as the Nonqualified Stock Option Agreement with respect to the retention bonus stock option award dated July 15, 2013 and the Nonqualified Stock Option Agreement with respect to the Horn River bonus stock option award dated July 15, 2013 (together, the “Award Agreements”), with the effect that in each instance where the number of shares of Company stock with respect to the stock option award is stated, the respective Letter and Award Agreement shall be read to state 240,075 shares instead of 250,0000 shares, and as such each of the Letters and the Award Agreements will reflect that the difference of 9,925 shares was never awarded to you.  Except as expressly provided in this letter, each of the Letters and the Award Agreements shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its respective terms.Thank you for your understanding and your efforts on behalf of Quicksilver.Sincerely,/s/ Glenn DardenGlenn DardenPresident/CEOI have read and understand the contents of this letter and acknowledge its provisions./s/ David Rushford April 16, 2014David Rushford Date
