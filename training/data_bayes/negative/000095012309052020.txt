Form of Amended and Restated Bylaws



Annex 1




 







 



 


AMENDED AND RESTATED BYLAWS




These Amended and Restated Bylaws are subject to, and governed by, the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware (the Delaware General Corporation Law) and the certificate of
incorporation (as the same may be amended and restated from time to time, the Certificate of
Incorporation) of _________, a Delaware corporation (the Corporation).


ARTICLE I



Offices



     Section 1.1 Registered Office. The registered office in the State of Delaware shall be in
the City of Wilmington, County of New Castle, and the resident agent is The Corporation Trust
Company. The registered office and registered agent of the Corporation shall be as designated from
time to time by the appropriate filing by the Corporation in the office of the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware.


     Section 1.2 Other Offices. The Corporation may also have offices at such other places both
within and without the State of Delaware as the board of directors of the Corporation (the Board)
may from time to time determine or the business of the Corporation may require.


ARTICLE II



Meetings of Stockholders



     Section 2.1 Place of Meeting. All meetings of stockholders of the Corporation
(Stockholders) for the election of directors of the Corporation (Directors) shall be held in
the City of Fort Worth, Texas, or in such other places both within and without the State of
Delaware as the Board may determine. The Board shall fix the place within Fort Worth, Texas for the
holding of each meeting. Meetings of Stockholders for any other purpose may be held at such place,
within or without the State of Delaware, and time as shall be stated in the notice of the meeting
or in a duly executed waiver of notice thereof.



     Section 2.2 Annual Meeting. The annual meeting of Stockholders (the Annual Meeting)
shall be held at such date and time as the Board shall designate; provided, however, in lieu
of the an Annual Meeting, the Stockholders may act pursuant to written consent as permitted

Annex 1



 




 






     Section 2.3 Special Meeting. Special meetings of the Stockholders, for any purpose or
purposes, unless otherwise prescribed by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation, may be
called by the Chairman of the Board, the President or the Board, and shall be called by the
Chairman of the Board or the President, or by the Secretary at the request in writing of
Stockholders owning a majority in amount of the entire capital stock of the Corporation issued and
outstanding and entitled to vote. The request shall state the purpose of the proposed meeting. The
persons calling or requesting any special meeting shall fix the time and any place, either within
or without the State of Delaware, as the place for holding the meeting. The only business that can
be transacted at a special meeting is that which is specifically stated in the notice of the
meeting or in a duly executed waiver of notice of the meeting.


     Section 2.4 Notice of Meeting. Written notice of the Annual Meeting, and each special
meeting of Stockholders, stating, in the case of a special meeting, the time, place and the
business to be transacted, shall be served upon, mailed to or otherwise given to each Stockholder
entitled to vote, at least ten (10) days but not more than sixty (60) days before the date of the
meeting. If notice is to be sent by mail, it shall be directed to each Stockholder at the address
as it appears on the records of the Corporation, unless the Stockholder has filed with the
Secretary of the Corporation a written request that notices to be mailed to some other address, in
which case notice shall be sent to the other address. Notice of any meeting of Stockholders is not
be required to be given to any Stockholder who attends the meeting in person or by proxy and, at
the beginning of the meeting, does not object to the transaction of any business asserting the
meeting is not lawfully called or convened, or who either before or after the meeting, submits a
signed waiver of notice, in person or by proxy.


     Section 2.5 Quorum. The holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding and
entitled to vote, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at any
meeting of Stockholders for the transaction of business except as otherwise provided by statute,
the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws. If a quorum is not present, in person or by
proxy, at any meeting of Stockholders or any adjournment, the chairman of the meeting or a majority
in interest of the Stockholders entitled to vote who are present, in person or by proxy, may
adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting
(unless the Board, after the adjournment, fixes a new record date for the adjourned meeting), until
a quorum is present, in person or by proxy. At any adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present,
in person or by proxy, any business may be transacted that could have been transacted at the
original meeting had a quorum been present; provided that, if the adjournment is for more than
thirty (30) days or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting,
a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each Stockholder of record entitled to vote at
the adjourned meeting as provided in Section 2.4.


     Section 2.6 Voting. When a quorum is present at any meeting of Stockholders, the vote of the
holders of a majority of the stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy
shall decide any question brought before the meeting, unless the question is one upon which a
different percentage of the vote is required by express provision of the applicable Delaware
statutes, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws. The Stockholders present at a meeting
constituted in accordance with these Bylaws may continue to transact business until adjournment,
even if Stockholders leave the meeting and the Stockholders remaining are less than a quorum. Every
Stockholder with the right to vote is entitled to vote in


Annex 1



 




 


person, or by proxy appointed by a written document signed by the Stockholder, on a date not
more than eleven months prior to voting, unless the written document provides for a longer period,
and filed with the Secretary of the Corporation at the time of, the meeting.



     If the written proxy designates two or more persons to act as proxies, unless the instrument
provides to the contrary, a majority of such persons present at any meeting at which their powers
thereunder are to be exercised shall have and may exercise all the powers of voting or giving
consents thereby conferred, or if only one be present, then the powers may be exercised by that
one; or, if an even number attend and a majority do not agree on any particular issue, each proxy
so attending shall be entitled to exercise the proxys powers in respect of the same portion of the
shares as he is of the proxies in attendance. Each Stockholder shall have one vote for each share
of stock having voting power registered in his name on the books of the Corporation. Except where
the transfer books of the Corporation shall have been closed or a date shall have been fixed as a
record date for the determination of its Stockholders entitled to vote, no share of stock shall be
voted at any election for Directors which has been transferred on the books of the Corporation
within twenty (20) days preceding the election of Directors. No proxy shall be valid after three
(3) years from the date of its execution, unless otherwise provided in the proxy. If no date is
stated in a proxy, the proxy shall be presumed to have been executed on the date of the meeting at
which it is first to be voted. Each proxy shall be revocable unless expressly provided therein to
be irrevocable and coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power or
unless otherwise made irrevocable by law.


     Section 2.7 Voting of Stock of Certain Holders. Shares standing in the name of another
corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other entity, domestic or foreign, may be
voted by such officer, agent or proxy as the governing documents of that entity may prescribe or,
in the absence of such provision, as the board or other governing person or body of that entity may
determine. Shares standing in the name of a deceased person may be voted by the executor or
administrator of the deceased person, either in person or by proxy. Shares standing in the name of
a guardian, conservator or trustee may be voted by such fiduciary, either in person or by proxy,
but no such fiduciary shall be entitled to vote shares held in that fiduciary capacity without a
transfer of the shares into the name of the fiduciary. Shares standing in the name of a receiver
may be voted by the receiver. A Stockholder whose shares are pledged shall be entitled to vote
those shares, unless in the transfer by the pledgor on the books of the Corporation he has
expressly empowered the pledgee to vote the shares, in which case only the pledgee, or his proxy,
may represent the shares and vote them.


     Section 2.8 Treasury Stock. The Corporation shall not vote, directly or indirectly, shares
of its own stock owned by it; and these shares shall not be counted in determining the total number
of outstanding shares.


     Section 2.9 Closing Transfer Books or Fixing Record Date. The Board may close the stock
transfer books of the Corporation for a period not exceeding sixty (60) days preceding the date of
any meeting of Stockholders, or the date for payment of any dividend or distribution, or the date
for the allotment of rights or the date when any change, or conversion or exchange of capital stock
shall go into effect or for a period not exceeding sixty (60) days in connection with obtaining the
consent of Stockholders for any purpose. In lieu of closing the stock transfer books, the Board may
fix in advance a date, not exceeding sixty (60) days preceding the date of any


Annex 1



 




 


meeting of Stockholders, or the date for payment of any dividend or distribution, or the date
for the allotment of rights, or the date when any change, or conversion or exchange of capital
stock shall go into effect, or a date in connection with obtaining written consent, as a record
date for the determination of the Stockholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, any meeting
and any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution, or to
any allotment of rights, or to exercise the rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange
of capital stock, or to give consent, and in each case those Stockholders and only those
Stockholders as shall be Stockholders of record on the date so fixed shall be entitled to notice of
the meeting to vote at the meeting or any adjournment thereof, or to receive payment of dividend or
distribution, or to receive allotment of rights, or to exercise rights, or to give consent, as the
case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any stock on the books of the Corporation after any
record date fixed as described above.



     Section 2.10 Notice of Stockholder Business at Annual Meeting. At an Annual Meeting of the
Stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been brought before the meeting
(a) pursuant to the Corporations notice of meeting, (b) by or at the direction of a majority of
the members of the Board, or (c) by any Stockholder of the Corporation of record at the time of
giving of notice provided for in these Bylaws who shall be entitled to vote at such meeting.


     Section 2.11 Order of Business. The order of business at all meetings of Stockholders shall
be as determined by the chairman of the meeting.


     Section 2.12 Conduct of Meeting. The Chairman of the Board, if office has been filled, and, if
not or if the Chairman of the Board is absent or otherwise unable to act, the President shall
preside at all meetings of Stockholders. The Secretary shall keep the records of each meeting of
Stockholders. In the absence or inability to act of any officer, the officers duties shall be
performed by the officer given the authority to act for such absent or non-acting officer under
these Bylaws or by a person appointed by the meeting.


     Section 2.13 Certain Rules of Procedure Relating to Stockholder Meetings. All Stockholder
meetings, annual or special, shall be governed in accordance with the following rules:


     (a) only Stockholders of record will be permitted to present motions from the floor at any
meeting of Stockholders; and


     (b) the chairman of the meeting shall preside over and conduct the meeting, and all questions
of procedure or conduct of the meeting shall be decided solely by the chairman of the meeting. The
chairman of the meeting shall have all power and authority vested in a presiding officer by law or
practice to conduct an orderly meeting. Among other things, the chairman of the meeting shall have
the power to adjourn or recess the meeting, to silence or expel persons to ensure the orderly
conduct of the meeting, to declare motions or persons out of order, to prescribe rules of conduct
and an agenda for the meeting, to impose reasonable time limits on questions and remarks by any
Stockholder, to limit the number of questions a Stockholder may ask, to limit the nature of
questions and comments to one subject matter at a time as dictated by any agenda for the meeting,
to limit the number of speakers or persons addressing the chairman

attendance at the meeting to Stockholders of record, beneficial owners of stock who present letters
from the record holders confirming their status as beneficial owners, and the proxies of record and

     Section 2.14 Requests for Stockholder List. Stockholders shall have those rights afforded
under Section 219 of the Delaware General Corporation Law to inspect a list of Stockholders during
the ten (10) days preceding each meeting of Stockholders.


     Section 2.15 Action without a Meeting. Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of
Incorporation or these Bylaws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the
Stockholders may be taken by written consent without meeting, in accordance with the applicable

     (a) Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to any
threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation), by
reason of the fact that he or she (or a person of whom he or she is a legal representative) is or
was a Director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving or has agreed to serve at the
request of the Corporation in any capacity, any corporation, limited liability company,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee
benefit plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as an
officer, director, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to
the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may be
amended (but, in the case of such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the
Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than permitted prior to such amendment),
against all expense, liability and loss (including, without limitation, attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement)
actually and reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith and such
indemnification shall continue as to person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or
agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators, if the
person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed
to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding,
had no reasonable cause to believe the persons conduct was unlawful. The termination of any
action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo
contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not
act in good faith and in a manner which the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to
the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had
reasonable cause to believe that the persons conduct was unlawful.


     (b) The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be
made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the
Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that the person is or was a
Director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, manager or officer of another corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and
reasonably incurred by the person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or
suit if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or


Annex 1



 




 


not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation and except that no indemnification shall
be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged
to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Delaware Court of Chancery
or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that,
despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person
is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Delaware Court of
Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.



     (c) To the extent that a present or former Director or officer of the Corporation has been
successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in
subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 10.1, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein,
such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and
reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith.


     (d) Any indemnification under subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 10.1 (unless ordered by
a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a
determination that indemnification of the present or former Director or officer is proper in the
circumstances because the person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in
subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 10.1. This determination shall be made, with respect to a
person who is a Director or officer at the time of such determination, (1) by a majority vote of
the Directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a
quorum, or (2) by a committee of such Directors designated by majority vote of such Directors, even
though less than a quorum, or (3) if there are no such Directors, or if such directors so direct,
by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (4) by the Stockholders.


     (e) Upon authorization of the Board and subject to any limitations or conditions imposed by
it, the Corporation may indemnify its employees and agents to the same extent and in the same
manner provided to Directors and officers in this Section 10.1. Also, the Board may authorize the
advancing of expenses to its employees and agents to the same extent provided to Directors and
officers in Section 10.2 subject to any limitations or conditions the Board may deem appropriate.


     Section 10.2 Advances for Expenses. Expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by an
officer or Director in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit
or proceeding may be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action,
suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Director or officer to
repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be
indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this section. Such expenses (including attorneys
fees) incurred by former Directors and officers or other employees and agents may be so paid upon
such terms and conditions, if any, as the Corporation deems appropriate


     Section 10.3 Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The right to indemnification and the payment of
expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this
Section shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire
under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws, agreement, vote of

person against such expense, liability or loss under the Delaware General Corporation Law.



     Section 10.5 Savings Clause. If all or any part of Article X is invalidated on any
ground by any court of competent jurisidiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless
indemnify and hold harmless each current, former or proposed Director and officer of the
Corporation, as to costs, charges and expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments,
fines, and amounts paid in settlement with respect to any action, suit or proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative to the full extent permitted by any

expert competence, including information, opinions, reports or statements as to the value and
amount of assets, liabilities, profits or losses of the Company or the value and amount of assets
or reserves or contracts, agreements or other undertakings that would be sufficient to pay claims
