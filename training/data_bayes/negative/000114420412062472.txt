- TERM OF PARTNERSHIP

 

The Partnership
began on December 29, 2007, and will end on January 1, 2017, and thereafter from year to year unless sooner terminated as specifically
provided in Article IV of this Agreement, or any other applicable provision of this Partnership Agreement. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein contained, however, this Partnership Agreement shall remain in force and effect until such time as the MEMORANDUM
TRACKING ACCOUNT established in Article IV has been eliminated.

 

ARTICLE
IV - CONTRIBUTIONS TO PARTNERSHIP, FUNDING
AGREEMENT AND MEMORANDUM ACCOUNT

 

4.01
	The partners acknowledge that each Partner shall be obligated to contribute and will, upon demand, contribute to the Partnership
the amount of cash or property of agreed fair market value set out opposite the name of each on Exhibit “A”
as their initial capital contributions.

 

4.02	In
addition to the foregoing, Navitus has agreed to provide at its option, and from time to time during the term of this Agreement,
additional funding to Aurora which will not exceed in the aggregate $15,000,000.00. This is exclusive of any monies previously
provided from any other sources. Any such amounts contributed by Navitus to Aurora shall be allocated to Victory for purposes of
this Partnership Agreement, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, and may be used by Victory for any permissible
purpose.

 

4.03
	With regard to any such advance made by Navitus to Aurora that is then used by Victory to acquire or develop oil and gas
prospects or related enterprises on behalf of Aurora, Victory agrees to pay Navitus a ten percent (10%) preferred annual return
on each such investment tranche for a period of five (5) years from the date of any such advance, which amount shall be paid out
to Navitus prior to any other partnership disbursements or distributions of partnership proceeds under the terms hereof. Navitus
shall be responsible for allocating any payments made to it among its partners or investors in accordance with the terms of the
General Partnership Agreement of Navitus Energy Group or an agreement with an investor. Any preferred return payments made by Victory
to Navitus under the terms of this paragraph shall not constitute part of, or be credited against Navitus’s fifty percent
interest (50%) interest in those partnership proceeds remaining after payment of the preferred annual return, but shall be in addition
thereto. As additional consideration for the advancement of funds, all deductible intangible drilling costs associated with Victory’s
use of funds for Partnership purposes advanced shall be allocated by Aurora to Navitus under the special allocation procedures
of this Agreement and the Tax Partnership Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit “B”.

 

4.03(1)	Subject
to the terms hereof, and as additional consideration for the advancement of funds from Navitus from time to time, Victory shall
issue common stock warrants to Navitus in an amount equal to one warrant for each dollar investment made by Navitus, and used by
Victory in oil and gas operations, acquisitions or related enterprises on behalf of Aurora. Victory shall have fifteen (15) business
days to issue the warrants to Navitus. The warrants shall be exercisable within a period of five (5) years of the date of the issuance
of the warrants, at a price equivalent to one hundred percent (100%) of the closing price of Victory’s stock on the day such
funds were initially advanced. Navitus shall be responsible for allocating these warrants among its partners or investors in accordance
with the terms of the General Partnership Agreement of Navitus, or any other applicable investor agreement. Any shares obtained
by the exercise of the referenced warrants by Navitus, or any of its partners or other investors, shall be restricted by a “leak
out” restriction whereby Navitus, or the applicable partner or investor, cannot sell more than five percent (5%) of any such
shares during any calendar month following the exercise date or dates of the warrants. If the exercise of any such warrants renders
Navitus, its partners or an investors an “insider,” as defined by applicable securities regulations, then Navitus,
or any such partner or investor shall be subject to such other and further trading limitations as may be required to be in compliance
with any such laws or regulations. Navitus and Victory recognize that the common stock warrants provided for herein may be issued
with restrictions under SEC Rule 144 and Navitus agrees to comply with any such restriction.

 




    3
     
    
 

4.03(2)	With
regard to any such advance made by Navitus to Aurora that is not used by Victory in a manner directly attributable to the acquisition
or development of a specific well or asset, those funds shall be treated as a five (5) year ten percent (10%) convertible debenture
to Victory. With respect to these funds, Victory agrees to pay Navitus a ten percent (10%) interest rate on the unpaid portion
of any such Navitus investment not used for Partnership purposes, for a period not to exceed five (5) years from the date of any
such advance, or until the debenture is converted to equity, whichever is the first to occur. Further, for any funds not utilized
by Victory for Partnership purposes, Victory shall issue Convertible Debentures to Navitus in an amount which, if converted into
Victory common stock under the terms hereof, will entitle Navitus to that number of Victory shares equivalent to the funds advanced
by Navitus, and used by Victory for purposes other than oil and gas exploration or acquisition of or development of Partnership
assets, divided by the closing price of Victory’s common stock on the day such funds are advanced. The Convertible Debenture,
the terms of which will be in a Convertible Debenture Agreement to be executed by Navitus and Victory, shall also provide Navitus
with an equivalent amount of common stock warrants, exercisable within five (5) years of the date of issuance of any such Convertible
Debenture, at a price equivalent to one hundred and twenty-five percent (125%) of the closing price of Victory’s stock on
the day such funds were initially advanced.

 

At
any time during the five (5) year term of any such loan, the Convertible Debenture shall provide Navitus with the option to convert
any proportion of the Debenture into Victory common stock at any time in lieu of the repayment of principal and interest, and any
such conversion shall be in complete satisfaction of all outstanding indebtedness associated with that proportion of the Convertible
Debenture. Navitus agrees to provide Victory with written notice of such conversion no less than fifteen (15) days prior to any
such conversion.

 

4.03(3)	Any
Convertible Debenture issued by Victory hereunder shall be subject to a “forced” or “automatic” conversion
into Victory common stock during any period in which the share price of Victory common stock is equal to or exceeds two hundred
percent (200%) of the share price on the day the funds were advanced, for twenty (20) consecutive trading days, and Navitus shall
receive that number of shares which is equivalent to the funds used by Victory for non-Partnership purposes, divided by a price
equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the closing price of Victory stock on the day funds were advanced by Navitus. In the event
of a conversion of a Convertible Debenture under the terms of this Paragraph, the Navitus loan for which the Convertible Debenture
was issued shall be satisfied and fully extinguished, and any security agreement or other instrument that served as security for
such loan shall be released. Victory agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees and legal
expenses, in connection with the documentation of the Debenture, the Warrants, the security Agreement and other documents to be
delivered hereunder.

 

4.03(4)	Upon
conversion of a Convertible Debenture, either forced or voluntary, the common shares obtained by such conversion shall be restricted
shares and cannot be traded for a term of six (6) months from the date of the conversion, or for such longer periods of time as
may be required by applicable securities laws or any regulatory body having jurisdiction in the premises. Further, any such shares
shall be restricted by a “leak out” provision whereby Navitus cannot sell more than five percent (5%) of any such converted
shares during any calendar month following the date such shares become free trading and unrestricted shares. If the conversion
of any such Convertible Debenture renders Navitus an “insider” as defined by applicable securities regulations, then
Navitus shall be subject to such other and further trading limitations as may be required to be in compliance with any such laws
or regulations.

 

4.03(5)	Any
loan made by Navitus hereunder can be repaid by Victory from its share of Partnership income, from funds raised through third parties
or capital markets, or by the conversion of any Convertible Debenture as described above, at any time during the five (5) year
term of the loan; provided, however, should Victory tender a cash payment to Navitus in repayment of any such loan, Navitus shall
have the option to accept this payment in satisfaction of any such loan, or to decline the payment and elect to convert the Convertible
Debenture associated with such loan if a conversion has not otherwise occurred as of the date a cash payment is tendered. The election
to convert upon tender of a cash payment shall be made not later than the end of the first business day following the date of any
such cash tender.

 

4.03(6)	The
Conversion Price and the number of shares of common stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time due to the subdivision
or combination of stock. If at any time or time after the Debenture date Victory shall subdivide its outstanding shares of Debenture
Stock, the conversion price in effect immediately prior to such issuance shall be proportionately reduced. If the outstanding Debenture
Shares are combined into a smaller number of shares, the conversion price in effect immediately in effect prior to such combination
or reverse split shall be proportionately increased.

 

4.04	The
parties hereto recognize that since 2007, JCE and JCC have provided funding to Victory for oil and gas drilling and exploration,
and for general and administrative expenses, in the amount of $11,700,000.00 and have allowed Victory to retain and use all of
the Partnership income for general operational expenses and oil and gas operations. In consideration of this initial funding the
parties hereby establish a MEMORANDUM TRACKING ACCOUNT, the purpose of which is to provide a “benchmark”, or date certain,
for the partition in kind of Partnership Assets, and to provide a mechanism through which Victory can provide funds for Partnership
activities up to $11,700,000.00, and such other amounts as are equal to any investment tranches advanced by Navitus under Paragraph
4.02 above.

 

4.05	
The initial MEMORANDUM TRACKING ACCOUNT balance shall be $11,280,000.00, as of October 1, 2011. The MEMORANDUM TRACKING ACCOUNT
balance will be increased by the amount of any funds advanced by Navitus under the provisions of Paragraph 4.02 above, up to and
including the amount of $15,000,000.00. Any asset acquisition made by Victory on behalf of Aurora from funds acquired by Victory
from a source or sources other than Navitus shall serve to reduce the MEMORANDUM TRACKING ACCOUNT BALANCE by an amount equal to
the investment made by Victory on Aurora’s behalf.

 

4.06	At
such time as Victory has made investments on behalf of Aurora, either through the use of Victory Energy profits or funds advanced
by third parties in an amount equal to the then MEMORANDUM TRACKING ACCOUNT balance, the MEMORANDUM TRACKING ACCOUNT shall be extinguished.
Within fifteen (15) business days from the date of elimination of the MEMORANDUM TRACKING ACCOUNT, Victory and Navitus agree to
partition and segregate all Aurora assets, including any pending acquisitions, into two (2) equal shares. Fifty Percent (50%) of
all existing Aurora Assets shall then be conveyed in fee to Victory, and the remaining Fifty Percent (50%) of all existing Aurora
Assets shall be conveyed in fee to Navitus, notwithstanding any language to the contrary contained in this Partnership Agreement.

 




    4
     
    
 

4.07	Upon
the distribution of Aurora assets to Victory and to Navitus, the parties shall make an election in writing, within an additional
fifteen (15) business days from the date of conveyance of Partnership Assets, to continue Aurora as a Texas General Partnership
or to dissolve same under the terms hereof and applicable partnership law. The failure of either party to consent to the continuation
of Aurora as on ongoing entity will result in the dissolution of Aurora as stated.

 

4.08	Should
the parties elect to continue the partnership activities of Aurora under the provisions of this Article and Article III, a new
MEMORANDUM TRACKING ACCOUNT shall be established under the terms hereof, and the provisions of this Article IV shall govern such
other operations and funds as may be advanced by Victory or Navitus from time to time during the remaining term of the Partnership;
provided, however, as to those assets which were distributed to Victory upon elimination of the MEMORANDUM ACCOUNT, and which are
no longer partnership assets, Navitus and Victory shall have the right to participate in each new drilling operation or acquisition
made or conducted by the other on any such property, or on any property subsequently acquired by either party within a one (1)
square mile area of a distributed property, by making one (1) of the following elections: (1) by electing to participate for up
to a fifty percent (50%) of Victory’s or Navitus’s working interest on every new drilling activity, or property acquisition,
including mineral or royalty rights or leases in the referenced area or, (2) by electing to receive a fifteen percent (15%) carried
working interest in all such activities on the referenced area, or (3) by electing to receive a three percent (3%) overriding royalty
interest in any such new operations or acquisitions, proportionately reduced, in lieu of all other options. Navitus or Victory
will make the applicable election in writing, on an asset by asset basis, within five (5) business days of its receipt of written
notice from the other that additional drilling operations or acquisitions are going to be conducted on any such properties. The
parties hereto agree to execute such other and further documents as may be required to effectuate the provisions of this Article
4.08, including operating agreements, exploration agreements and area of mutual interest agreements.

 

4.09	Should
the parties elect to terminate this Partnership in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 4.07, or upon the termination of
this Partnership at any other time in accordance with its terms, the parties hereto agree that Navitus shall have the right and
option for a period of ten (10) years from the date of termination of this Partnership to participate in each new drilling operation,
property or lease acquisition, or mineral or royalty acquisition made or conducted by Victory anywhere, whether in the United States
or any foreign country, by making one (1) of the following optional elections: (1) by electing to participate for up to a fifty
percent (50%) of Victory’s working interest on every new drilling activity or property acquisition, including mineral or
royalty rights or leases in the referenced area or, (2) by electing to receive a fifteen percent (15%) carried working interest
in all such activities on the referenced area, or (3) by electing to receive a three percent (3%) overriding royalty interest in
any such new operations or acquisitions, or leases, proportionately reduced, in lieu of all other options. Should it decide to
exercise its options under the terms of this paragraph, Navitus will make the applicable election in writing, on an asset by asset
basis, within five (5) business days of its receipt of written notice from Victory that additional drilling operations or acquisitions
are going to be conducted. The parties hereto agree to execute such other and further documents as may be required to effectuate
the provisions of this Article 4.09, including operating agreements, exploration agreements and area of mutual interest agreements.

 

4.10	The partners further acknowledge
that as of October 1, 2011, since the formation of the Partnership on January 1, 2008, funds have been loaned by the partnership
to Victory Energy Corporation and these loans have been repaid by Victory Energy Corporation to the partnership. These loans have
been recorded in the books of Victory and Aurora as “inter-company loans”. The balances of these inter-company loans
as of October 1, 2011, are $429,583 which is represented by a loan receivable on Victory’s books and a loan payable on Aurora’s
books.

 

Victory and Aurora
hereby agree that as of October 1, 2011, the amount of $417,567 will be removed from the loan receivable account on Victory’s
books and recorded as an additional partnership investment in Aurora by Victory. The amount of $417,567 will be removed from the
loan payable account on Aurora’s books and recorded as an additional partnership investment in Aurora by Victory in the form
of a “Capital Contribution.” Future payments by Victory toward investments in oil & gas projects that qualify as
a reduction of the Memorandum Tracking Account will be recorded on the books as an additional partnership investment by Victory
on Victory’s books and an additional partner Capital Contribution by Victory on Aurora’s books. All other transfers
of funds between Victory and Aurora will continue to be recorded as inter-company loans subject to repayment by the party who is
the beneficiary of the loaned funds.

8.06	The
Managing Partner shall have full power to appoint by written instrument an agent or agents or act for him upon such terms and conditions
and subject to such limitations as he may specify in the instrument appointing such agents, and such agents shall thereupon have
the power and authority to carry out such duties as may be specified in the instrument appointing them.

 

8.07	The
enumeration of specific powers and authority herein shall not limit the generality or the extent of the full power and authority
hereby vested in the Managing Partner to do any and all things necessary, requisite or desirable in furtherance of the purposes
of the Partnership, and the only limitations upon the power and authorities of the Managing Partner to carry on the Partnership
business and to deal with and in the Partnership properties for the use and benefit of the Partnership shall be the limitations

8.09	All
Partners recognize that sometimes there are practical difficulties in doing business as a Partnership, occasioned by outsiders
seeking to satisfy themselves relative to the capacity of the Partner to act for and on behalf of the Partnership, or for other
reasons. Therefore, each Partner hereby specifically authorizes the other Partners to acquire all real and personal property, arrange
all financing, enter contracts and complete all other arrangements needed to effectuate the purposes set forth in Article II hereof,
either in his or its own name or in the name of a nominee, without having to disclose the existence of this Partnership. If a Partner
decides to carry on the business of the Partnership in his or its own name or in the name of a nominee, such Partner shall place
a written declaration of trust in the Partnership books and records that acknowledges the nominee's capacity in which it acts and
the name of the true or equitable owner, namely, the Partnership.

 

8.10	The
acquisition of Partnership Property or the creation of indebtedness of the Partnership in the name of a Partner acting as such
a nominee shall not give such Partner an interest in Partnership Property or cause him to be liable for a Partnership debt in excess
of his percentage of interest in the Partnership as is set opposite its name in Exhibit “A” attached hereto;
provided, however, anything to the contrary contained hereinabove notwithstanding, no note or other obligation executed by such
Partner as maker, the nature of which imposes no personal liability on the Partnership for the payment of such note or performance
of such obligation.

(1)	Do
any act in contravention of this Agreement;

 

(2)	Do
any act which would make it impossible to carry on the business of the Partnership;

 

(3)	Possess
Partnership Property or assign the right of the Partnership or its Partners in specific Partnership Property for other than a Partnership
purpose;

 

(4)	Make,
execute, or deliver any general assignments for the benefit of creditors, or any bond, guaranty, indemnity bond or surety bond;

 

(5)	Assign,
transfer, pledge, compromise, or release any claim of the Partnership except for full payment, or arbitrate, or consent to the
arbitration of any of its disputes or controversies;

 

(6) 	Do any
of the following without the unanimous consent of all of the Partners:

 


(a)Confess a judgment;

 


(b)Make, execute, or deliver for the Partnership any bond, mortgage,

not in numbers, of said Partners may call a special meeting to be held in Midland County, Texas, or at any other place upon agreement
of the Partners, at any time after the giving of ten (10) days notice to all of the Partners. Any Partner may waive notice of or
attendance at any meeting of the Partners, and may attend by telephone or any other electronic communication device or may execute
a signed written consent. At such meeting, the Partners shall transact such business as may properly be brought before the meeting.

 

8.12	Any
action required by statute or by this Agreement to be taken at a meeting of the Partnership, or any action which may be taken at
a meeting of the Partners, may be taken without a meeting if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be
signed by all of the Partners entitled to vote with respect to the subject matter thereof and such consent shall have the same
force and effect as a unanimous vote of the Partners. Any such signed consent, or a signed copy thereof, shall be placed in the
minute book of the Partnership.

 

ARTICLE IX
– RESTRICTION ON TRANSFERS

 

9.01	Except
as otherwise herein, and only during the term of this Partnership Agreement, no Partner may sell, assign, transfer, encumber, or
otherwise dispose of any interest in the Partnership, Partnership Property, or assets of the Partnership without the prior written
consent of 100% in interest, not in numbers, of all other Partners, and shall not pass title to said interest or property in the
absence of such consent, and any such prohibited transfer, if made, shall be void and without force or effect and any attempt by
any Partner to dispose of his interest in violation of this prohibition shall constitute a material default hereunder.

 

ARTICLE X
- DEFAULT BY PARTNER

 

10.01	The
following events shall be deemed to be events of default by a Partner:

 

(1)	Failure
of a Partner to make when due any contributions or advance required -to be made under the terms of this Agreement and the continuance
of such failure for a period of ten (10) days after written notice thereof from the Manager of the Partnership to such Partner.

 

(2)	Violation
of any of the other provisions of this Agreement and failure to remedy or cure such violation within ten (10) days after written
notice of such violation from the Manager of the Partnership or the other Partners.

making of an assignment for benefit of creditors or the filing of a petition under any section or chapter of the National Bankruptcy
Act, as amended, or under any similar law or statute of the United States or any state thereof.

 

(4)	Adjudication
of Partner as a bankrupt or insolvent in proceedings filed against the Partner under any section or chapter of the National Bankruptcy
Act, as amended, or under any similar law or statute of the United States, or any state thereof without further possibility of

(5)	The
appointment of a receiver for all or substantially all of the assets of a Partner and the failure to have such receiver discharged
within thirty (30) days after appointment.

 

(6)	The
bringing of any legal action against a Partner by his creditor on a liquidated debt of the Partner, resulting in litigation which,
in the opinion of 100% in interest, not in numbers of the other Partners, creates a real and substantial risk of involvement of
the Partnership Property which will probably:

 


(a)Act to their financial detriment; or

 


(b)Result in such creditor, or his assigns, succeeding in or to all or a part of the interest of
such Partner in the Partnership.

 

(7)	The failure
of the Distributees to appoint, in the manner and within the time prescribed, the agent required under Paragraph 9.02.

 

10.02 	Upon
the Occurrence of an event of default by a Partner, 100% in interest, not in numbers, or more of the other Partners shall have
the right, at their election, which election may be made at any time within one (l) year from the date of such default, upon giving
the defaulting Partner ten (10) days written notice of such election (and provided such default is continuing on the date such
notice is given) to terminate the interest of the defaulting Partner without affecting a termination of the Partnership. In the
event of such termination each and every non-defaulting Partner (hereinafter referred to as the Purchasing Partners) who voted
to elect such option shall be required to purchase, pro rata, in the proportion that his interest in the Partnership bears to the
aggregate of all interests in the Partnership of all non-defaulting Partners who voted to elect such option, the interest of the
defaulting Partner.

 




    8
     
    
 

The purchase price
to be paid to the defaulting Partner shall be paid in cash, or, at the option of the Purchasing Partners, by the execution and
delivery of each Purchasing Partner's note payable to the order of the defaulting Partner, in the amount of the purchase price.
Said note shall bear interest at the rate of ten per cent (10%) per annum and shall be payable in ten (10) equal annual installments
of principal and interest, the first such payment to be made one (1) year from the date of execution and delivery of such note,
and with such note containing full prepayment privileges', without penalty. In the event the Purchasing Partners elect to exercise
the option contained in this Paragraph 10.02, the purchase price to be paid to the defaulting Partner shall be the fair market
value of the defaulting Partner's interest. Said purchase price shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of any outstanding debts
to the Partnership and also any and all damages caused by the default of the defaulting Partner. Fair market value shall be determined
in the manner set forth in Article XII hereof.

 

Upon receipt of
the aforesaid purchase price (cash or note), if any, by the defaulting Partner, the defaulting Partner shall have no further interest
in the Partnership or its business or assets and the defaulting Partner shall execute and deliver such assignments and other instruments
as may be reasonable to evidence and fully and effectively transfer the interest of the defaulting Partner to the non-defaulting
Partners. In the event the appropriate instruments are not delivered, after notice by the non-defaulting Partners of the Partnership
that the consideration is available to the defaulting Partner, the non-defaulting Partners of the Partnership may deliver such
consideration to the defaulting Partner and execute as the defaulting Partner's irrevocable agent, any such legal instruments to
the appropriate continuing Partners.

 

No assignment or
transfer of a defaulting Partner's interest as provided herein, shall relieve the defaulting Partner from any personal liability
for outstanding indebtedness, liabilities, liens, and obligations relating to the partnership which may exist on the date of the
assignment or transfer. The default of any Partner hereunder shall not relieve any other Partner from his or its agreements, liabilities,
and obligations hereunder. A defaulting Partner's interest in the Partnership shall not be considered in any Partnership voting
requirement.

 

10.03	Any
Partner may agree to assist any other Partner in the event of default and said agreement or any advancement or payment made thereunder
shall be secured by a lien upon the interest of the defaulting Partner in the Partnership which lien may be foreclosed, at the
option of the assisting Partner.

 

10.04	If
any Partner shall default in the performance or observance of any covenant, condition, or other provision of this Partnership Agreement
to be performed or observed, any other Partner may, without waiving any claim for breach of this Partnership Agreement, and after
written notice which is reasonable under the circumstances, cure such default for the account of the defaulting Partner, and the
defaulting Partner shall reimburse or repay any reasonable amount paid and any reasonable expense or contractual liability so incurred,
with interest at the highest lawful rate; and said obligation to reimburse and repay shall be secured by a lien upon the interest
of the defaulting Partner in the Partnership, which lien may be foreclosed, at the option of the Partner exercising this option
to cure default, by the non-defaulting Partners of the Partnership.

 

10.05	In
the event a Partner is in default under the terms of this Partnership Agreement, the lien provided for in Paragraph 4.03 hereof,
at the option of 100% of the non-defaulting Partners, if they so elect, may be foreclosed by the non-defaulting Partners.

 

10.06	Each
Partner hereby makes, constitutes, and appoints the non-defaulting Partners of the Partnership as his or its attorney in fact in
the event he becomes a defaulting Partner whose interest in the Partnership has been foreclosed in the manner prescribed above
and upon such foreclosure, the non-defaulting Partners of the Partnership are authorized and allowed to execute and deliver a full
assignment or other transfer of the defaulting Partner's interest in the Partnership and the non-defaulting Partners of the Partnership
shall have no liability to any person in making such assignment or transfer.

 

10.07	Pursuit
of any of the foregoing remedies shall not preclude pursuit of any of the other remedies provided by law, nor shall pursuit of
any remedy herein provided constitute a forfeiture or waiver of any amount due to the remaining Partners hereunder or of any damages
accruing, to them by reason of the violation of any of the terms, pro visions, and covenants herein contained. No waiver by the
remaining Partners of any violation or breach shall be deemed or construed to constitute a waiver of any other violation or breach
of any of the terms, provisions, and covenants herein contained and forbearance by them to enforce one or more of the remedies
herein provided upon an event of default shall not be deemed or construed to constitute a waiver of such default.

 

ARTICLE XI
- AMENDMENT

 

11.01	Subject
to the provisions of Article VIII, this Agreement may be amended or modified by the Partners from time to time but only by a written
instrument executed by Partners owning collectively at least 100% in interest, not in numbers, in the Partnership.

12.02	Within
ten (10) days after an appraisal is required under any provisions hereof, each group or individual, as the case may be, shall select

the specified time, the other party may select the second appraiser.

 

12.03	The
two appraisers so selected shall proceed to promptly determine the fair market value of the Partnership interest, including therein
a fair market valuation of the interest and equity in the Partnership of the Partner in question taking into consideration any
outstanding indebtedness, liabilities, liens, and obligations relating to the Partnership Property. The determination of such fair
market value by the two appraisers, selected-as hereinabove provided, shall be final and binding upon all parties and if the two
appraisers so selected are unable to agree upon such fair market value, said two appraisers shall select a third appraiser (who
shall also be a member of the American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers) whose determination as to such fair market value shall
be averaged with the appraisals of the other two appraisers, and the average of the three appraisals shall be conclusive evidence
as to such fair market value and shall be final and binding upon all parties. The appraisers shall deliver a written report of
their appraisal to the Partners of the Partnership who shall provide copies thereof to all interested parties.

 

12.04	Each
party shall pay the fee and expense of the appraiser selected by such party, and, if a third appraiser is selected, the fee of
the third appraiser shall be borne equally by the parties appointing the other two appraisers.

13.01	In
addition to the termination methods set forth in Article III and Article IV of this Agreement, the Partnership may be terminated
at any time at a specially called meeting upon the affirmative vote of 100% in interest, not in numbers, of the Partners. Upon
such termination, the assets of the Partnership shall be applied as follows: to payment of the outstanding Partnership liabilities,
although an appropriate reserve may be maintained and the amount determined by the Partners of the Partnership for any contingent
liability until said contingent liability is satisfied, and the balance of such reserve, if any, shall be distributed together
with any other sums remaining after payment of the outstanding Partnership liabilities to the Partners as their interest appears
on Exhibit “A” unless otherwise provided herein.
