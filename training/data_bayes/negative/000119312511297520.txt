 (c) Sections 4.01, 4.02, 4.03 and 4.04 of the Original Credit Agreement are hereby
amended to read in their entirety as follows:  4.01. Borrowing Base. (a) The Borrowing Base
shall represent the approval in their sole discretion of the Required Lenders or all Lenders, as applicable, of Agents determination of the maximum loan amount that may be supported by the oil and gas properties of the Loan Parties included in
the most recent Reserve Report furnished to Agent, based upon Lenders in-house evaluation of such properties. The determination of the Borrowing Base (and, if applicable, the Conforming Borrowing Base) will be made in accordance with
then-current practices, economic and pricing parameters, methodology, assumptions, and customary procedures and standards established by each Lender from time to time for its petroleum industry customers including without limitation (a) an
analysis of such reserve and production data with respect to the Mineral Interests of the Loan Parties in all of their oil and gas properties, including the Mortgaged Properties, as is provided to Lenders in accordance herewith, (b) an analysis
of the assets, liabilities, cash flow, business, properties, prospects, management and ownership of each Loan Party and its Affiliates, and (c) such other credit factors consistently applied as each Lender customarily considers in evaluating
similar oil and gas credits. Borrower and Lenders acknowledge that (i) due to the uncertainties of the oil and gas extraction process, the properties included in any Reserve Report are not subject to evaluation with

   THIRD
AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT  Page 3 





 
a high degree of accuracy and are subject to potential rapid deterioration in value, and (ii) for this reason and the difficulties and expenses involved in liquidating and collecting against
the Mortgaged Properties, the determination of the maximum loan amount with respect to the properties included in any Reserve Report contains an equity cushion (market value in excess of loan amount) which Borrower acknowledges to be essential for
the adequate protection of Lenders.  (b) Until next determined as provided herein, the amount of the Borrowing
Base shall be $125,000,000 and the amount of the Conforming Borrowing Base shall be $115,000,000. As of the Borrowing Base Equalization Date, the Borrowing Base shall equal the Conforming Borrowing Base, and all references to the Conforming
Borrowing Base in this Agreement shall mean the Borrowing Base.  4.02. Periodic Determinations of
Borrowing Base.  (a) On each April 1 and October 1 commencing April 1, 2012, until the
Maturity Date, Borrower shall furnish to Agent a Reserve Report, which shall set out as of the six (6) months ending January 1 and July 1, respectively, the Proved Mineral Interests attributable to the Mortgaged Properties and such
other oil and gas properties of the Loan Parties as Borrower may select. Each October 1 Reserve Report may be prepared by Borrowers own engineers and shall be certified by the President or other Responsible Officer of Borrower. Each
April 1 Reserve Report shall be a complete report prepared by independent reservoir engineers reasonably acceptable to Agent relating to the Proved Mineral Interests attributable to the Mortgage Properties known as West Cote Blanche
Bay and Permian Basin, and such other oil and gas properties of the Loan Parties as Borrower may select. In addition, Borrower may submit with each April 1 Reserve Report a separate Reserve Report prepared by Borrowers
own engineers and certified by the President or other Responsible Officer of Borrower covering such other oil and gas properties of the Loan Parties as Borrower may select. Upon receipt of each such Reserve Report, Agent shall make a determination
of the Borrowing Base (and, if applicable, the Conforming Borrowing Base) and the Monthly Reduction Amount which shall become effective upon approval by the Required Lenders or all Lenders in accordance with the procedure set forth in
Section 4.04 and subsequent written notification from Agent to Borrower, and which, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement shall be the Borrowing Base (and, if applicable, the Conforming Borrowing Base) and the Monthly Reduction
Amount until the effective date of the next redetermination as provided in this Article IV.  (b) In the event
that Borrower does not furnish to Agent a Reserve Report by the dates specified in Section 4.02(a), then Agent and Lenders may nonetheless redetermine the Borrowing Base (and, if applicable, the Conforming Borrowing Base) and redesignate the
Borrowing Base (and, if applicable, the Conforming Borrowing Base) from time to time thereafter in their sole discretion until Agent receives the relevant Reserve Report, whereupon Agent and Lenders shall redetermine the Borrowing Base (and, if
applicable, the Conforming Borrowing Base) as otherwise specified in this Article IV.  4.03. Special
Determinations of Borrowing Base.  (a) Special determinations of the Borrowing Base may be requested by
Agent or Borrower not more than one time per calendar year each. If any special 
   THIRD
AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT  Page 4 





 
determination is requested by Borrower, it shall be accompanied by internally-prepared engineering data for the oil and gas reserves included in the Mortgaged Properties, and such additional
properties as Borrower may select, brought forward from the most recent Reserve Report furnished by Borrower to Agent. If any special determination is requested by Agent, Borrower will provide Agent with internally prepared engineering data for the
oil and gas reserves included in the Mortgaged Properties, and such additional properties as Borrower may select, updated from the most recent Reserve Report furnished to Agent, as soon as is reasonably practicable following the request. The
determination whether to increase or decrease the Borrowing Base (and, if applicable, the Conforming Borrowing Base) and the Monthly Reduction Amount shall then be made in accordance with the standards set forth in Section 4.01 hereof and the
procedures set forth in Section 4.04 hereof. In the event of any special determination of the Borrowing Base pursuant to this Section, Agent in the exercise of its discretion may suspend the next regularly scheduled determination of the
Borrowing Base.  (b) Borrower shall give Agent ten (10) Business Days prior written notice of any proposed
amendment, modification or termination of any Swap Contract or Forward Sales Contract, or any other action which Borrower or any Subsidiary proposes to take in connection with any Swap Contract or Forward Sales Contract which could impact its
Recognized Value in the then current Borrowing Base. Agent reserves the right to redetermine the Borrowing Base (and, if applicable, the Conforming Borrowing Base). As the result of any such action, and any such redetermination shall not be
considered a special determination requested by Agent within the meaning of the first sentence of Section 4.03(a). If requested by Borrower, Agent shall inform Borrower by email within such ten (10) Business Day period of the likely
reduction of the Borrowing Base (and, if applicable, the Conforming Borrowing Base) as the result of any action described in the first sentence of this Section 4.03(b). 
4.04. General Procedures With Respect to Determination of Borrowing Base. Agent shall propose a redetermined
Borrowing Base (and, if applicable, a redetermined Conforming Borrowing Base) and a Monthly Reduction Amount within sixty (60) days following receipt by Agent and Lenders of a Reserve Report and other applicable information. After having
received notice of such proposal from Agent, Required Lenders (or all Lenders in the event of a proposed increase in the Borrowing Base (and, if applicable, the Conforming Borrowing Base) or decrease in the Monthly Reduction Amount) shall have
fifteen (15) days to agree or disagree with such proposal. At the end of such fifteen (15) day period, if Required Lenders (or all Lenders, in the event of a proposed increase of the Borrowing Base (and, if applicable, a proposed increase
of the Conforming Borrowing Base) or decrease of the Monthly Reduction Amount) shall not have communicated their approval or disapproval, such silence shall be deemed an approval, and Agents proposal shall be the new Borrowing Base (and, if
applicable, the new Conforming Borrowing Base) and Monthly Reduction Amount. If, however, Required Lenders (or any Lender, in the event of a proposed increase of the Borrowing Base (and, if applicable, a proposed increase of the Conforming Borrowing
Base) or decrease of the Monthly Reduction Amount) notify Agent within such fifteen (15) days of their disapproval, Agent and Required Lenders (or all Lenders, in the event of a proposed increase of the Borrowing Base (and, if applicable, a
proposed increase of the Conforming Borrowing Base) or decrease of the Monthly Reduction Amount) shall agree on a new Borrowing Base (and, if applicable, a new Conforming Borrowing Base) and Monthly Reduction Amount. If the Required Lenders (or all
Lenders, in the event of a proposed increase of the Borrowing Base (and, if applicable, a proposed increase of the 
   THIRD
AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT  Page 5 





 
Conforming Borrowing Base) or decrease of the Monthly Reduction Amount) cannot agree on the amount of the Borrowing Base (and, if applicable, the Conforming Borrowing Base) or Monthly Reduction
Amount, as applicable, within seven (7) days after Agent has been notified of their disapproval, then Agent shall propose a new redetermined Borrowing Base (and, if applicable, a new Conforming Borrowing Base) and a new Monthly Reduction Amount
within fifteen (15) days after the end of such seven (7) day period and the foregoing process shall be repeated. This process shall be repeated until the Required Lenders (or all Lenders, in the event of a proposed increase of the
Borrowing Base (and, if applicable, a proposed increase of the Conforming Borrowing Base) or decrease of the Monthly Reduction Amount) agree on a new Borrowing Base (and, if applicable, a new Conforming Borrowing Base) and Monthly Reduction Amount.
In taking the above actions, Agent and Lenders shall act in accordance with their normal and customary procedures for evaluating oil and gas reserves and other related assets as such exist at that particular time and will otherwise act in their sole
discretion. Further, each Lender may consider such other credit factors as it deems appropriate which are consistent with its normal and customary procedures for evaluating oil and gas reserves. Without limiting the foregoing, Lenders may exclude
any oil and gas reserves or portion of production therefrom or any income from any other property from the Borrowing Base, at any time, because title information is not satisfactory or such oil and gas reserves are not Mortgaged Properties.
 (d) Section 8.05(h) of the Original Credit Agreement is hereby amended to read in its entirety as
follows:  (h) Asset Dispositions; provided that (1) all of the consideration received in respect to
such Asset Disposition shall be cash or oil and gas properties to be included in the Borrowing Base pursuant to Section 4.08, (2) the consideration received shall be equal to or greater than the fair market value thereof (as reasonably
determined by the board of directors or a Responsible Officer of Borrower and if requested by Agent, Borrower shall deliver a certificate of a Responsible Officer of Borrower certifying to that effect), and (3) to the extent that the Recognized
Value of the aggregate of all Asset Dispositions in any calendar year exceeds 5% of the then effective Borrowing Base (or, if applicable, 5% of the then effective Conforming Borrowing Base), then the Borrowing Base (and, if applicable, the
Conforming Borrowing Base) shall be reduced by the amount of such excess (by way of example, if after the Borrowing Base Equalization Date the Borrowing Base is $50,000,000 on September 1 and Asset Dispositions having a Recognized Value of
$1,000,000 occur on February 1, May 1 and September 1, then on September 1, the Borrowing Base would automatically reduce by $500,000 ($3,000,000$2,500,000 = $500,000)); 
4. Increase of Borrowing Base. As of the Effective Date the Borrowing Base is hereby increased from $90,000,000 to a
Conforming Borrowing Base of $115,000,000 and a Borrowing Base of $125,000,000.  5. Adjustment of Applicable Percentages
of Lenders. The Borrowing Base has been increased to $125,000,000 per Section 4 of this Amendment. On the Effective Date, Schedule 2.01 attached to the Original Credit Agreement shall be replaced with
Schedule 2.01 attached to this Amendment, and the Applicable Percentages and the Commitments held by each Lender shall be as follows: 
   THIRD

 (a) Amegy Bank National Association will have a Commitment of $35,000,000
(28% of the $125,000,000 Borrowing Base).  (b) The Bank of Nova Scotia will have a Commitment of $50,000,000
(40% of the $125,000,000 Borrowing Base).  (c) KeyBank National Association will have a Commitment of
$25,000,000 (20% of the $125,000,000 Borrowing Base).  (d) Société Générale will

(c) Borrower shall issue to KeyBank National Association a new Note (the KeyBank Replacement

(d) Borrower shall issue to Société Générale a new Note (the Société
Générale Replacement Note), in the original principal sum of $42,000,000 (12% of $350,000,000) dated the Effective Date to replace the existing Note to Société Générale in the amount of
$58,333,333.33 dated May 3, 2011.  7. Certain Representations. Borrower represents and warrants that, as of

enforceability may be limited by general principles of equity and applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, and other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally; and (b) no authorization,
approval, consent or other action by, notice to, or filing with, any Governmental Authority or other Person is required for the execution, delivery and performance by Borrower thereof. In addition, Borrower represents that after giving effect to
this Amendment, all representations and warranties contained in the Original Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the Effective Date as if made on and as of such date except to the

Credit Agreement, as amended hereby, is and remains in full force and effect. Borrower acknowledges and agrees that its liabilities and obligations under the Original Credit Agreement, as amended hereby, and under the Loan Documents, are not
impaired in any respect by this Amendment.  10. Limitation on Agreements. The modifications set forth herein are
limited precisely as written and shall not be deemed (a) to be a consent under or a waiver of or an amendment to any other term or condition in the Original Credit Agreement or any of the Loan Documents, or (b) to prejudice any right or
rights which Administrative Agent now has or may have in the future under or in connection with the Original Credit Agreement and the Loan Documents, each as amended hereby, or any of the other documents referred to herein or therein. The
Modification Papers shall constitute Loan Documents for all purposes.  11. Confirmation of Security. Borrower

in the Original Credit Agreement as modified by this Amendment.  12. Counterparts. This Amendment may be
executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, but all of which constitute one instrument. In making proof of this Amendment, it shall not be necessary to produce or account for more
