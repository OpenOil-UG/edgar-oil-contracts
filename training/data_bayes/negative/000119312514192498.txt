Corporation (the Company). The Plan was originally established by the Company on January 1, 1990. The Plan was amended and restated effective as of October 1, 2007. The Plan most recently was amended and restated
generally effective January 1, 2012 to reflect certain design changes, incorporate amendments and make certain other clarifying changes. The Plan again is amended and restated generally effective January 1, 2013 (the Effective
Date), except as otherwise required by law or provided herein, to (a) incorporate recent amendments and (b) to make certain other clarifying changes. 
1.02 Purposes. The purposes of the Plan are to encourage systematic savings to meet the financial needs of Eligible Employees both
during active employment and during retirement and to make available a number of investment vehicles for such savings.  1.03 Rights
Affected. Except as otherwise required by law or an amendment or as provided to the contrary herein, the provisions of this amended and restated Plan shall apply only to Employees who complete an Hour of Service on or after the Effective Date.
The rights of any other person shall be governed by the Plan as in effect on the date of his Severance from Service, except to the extent expressly provided in any amendment adopted subsequently thereto. 
1.04 Qualification under the Internal Revenue Code. It is intended that the Plan be a qualified profit-sharing plan within the meaning
of Code section 401(a), that the requirements of Code section 401(k) or 414(v) be satisfied as to that portion of the Plan represented by contributions made pursuant to Participant Salary Deferral elections, that the requirements of Code section
401(m) be satisfied as to that portion of the Plan represented by Matching Contributions and that the trust or other funding vehicle associated with the Plan be exempt from federal income taxation pursuant to the provisions of Code section 501(a).
The Company Common Stock Fund has been designated an employee stock ownership plan as defined in Code section 4975(e)(7).  1.05

Grandfathered Company Retirement Contribution Eligible Participant, the Employer shall make a Company Retirement Contribution to the Plan equal to the product of (A) the contribution rate from the table below for such individual based upon his

   15 





 
Years of Credited Service determined as of the first day of the Plan Year, multiplied by (B) such individuals Compensation for the Plan Year; provided, however, that, effective for
Plan Years beginning on and after January 1, 2012, in the event that the anniversary of such individuals Employment Commencement Date occurring during a Plan Year would result in an increase in the contribution rate based on the table
below, the Employers Company Retirement Contribution to the Plan for the Plan Year shall be calculated by applying (I) the lower contribution rate to such individuals Compensation for the Plan Year until the first payroll period
after the anniversary of the Employment Commencement Date and (II) the higher contribution rate to such individuals Compensation for the remainder of the Plan Year beginning on the first payroll period after the anniversary of the Employment
Commencement Date. For Plan Years beginning before January 1, 2012, Years of Credited Service shall be determined at the beginning of the applicable Plan Year for which the Company Retirement Contribution is made with respect to such Company
Retirement Contribution Eligible Participant, and, in making such determination, partial Years of Credited Service will be rounded up to the next whole Year of Credited Service.

 (c) Allocation of Company Retirement Contributions. Company Retirement Contributions shall be
contributed to the Plan by the Employer and allocated to the Company Retirement Contribution Accounts of the Company Retirement Contribution Eligible Participants at such time as the Employer deems to be appropriate, in its sole discretion. 
(d) Additional Company Retirement Contribution. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.04 to the contrary, for the Plan Year
ending on December 31, 2010 and subsequent Plan Years, the Employer shall make an additional Company Retirement Contribution to each Special Company Retirement Contribution Participant (as defined in Section 4.04(e) below) in an amount
equal to the difference, if any, between such Participants Minimum Company Retirement Contribution (as defined in Section 4.04(e) below) and such Participants Company Retirement Contribution determined under subsection (a) or
(b) of this Section 4.04, as the case may be. Any such additional Company Retirement Contribution shall be allocated to the Company Retirement Contribution Account of the Special Company Retirement Contribution Participant. 
(e) Definitions. For purposes of this Section 4.04: 
(1) Grandfathered Company Retirement Contribution Eligible Participant shall mean a Company Retirement Contribution
Eligible Participant who (A) received an offer of employment from an Employer on or before August 1, 2011 that included the contribution rate(s) described in the table in subsection (b); (B) accepted such offer; (C) has an
Employment Commencement Date on or after August 1, 2011 and (D) does not have a Severance from Service after becoming a Grandfathered Company Retirement Contribution Eligible Participant. 
   16 





 (2) Minimum Company Retirement Contribution shall mean 7.5% of the Special
Company Retirement Contribution Participants Minimum Company Retirement Contribution Compensation (as defined below) with respect to the applicable Plan Year. 
(3) Minimum Company Retirement Contribution Compensation shall mean compensation as defined in Treas. Reg. §
1.415(c)-2(d)(2) and including differential wage payments described in Code section 414(u)(12) made by reason of Qualified Military Service. Only $200,000 (adjusted in accordance with Code section 401(a)(17)(B)) of a Participants Minimum
Company Retirement Contribution Compensation shall be counted.  (4) Special Company Retirement Contribution Participant
shall mean a Participant who (A) is a Non-Highly Compensated Employee, (B) is at least 21 years old, (C) has at least one Year of Service; and (D) is an Employee on the last day of the applicable Plan Year. 
4.05 Matching Contributions. 
(a) Matching Contributions and Matching Rates. Subject to the limitations described in ARTICLE V, with respect to each Plan Year, the
Employer may contribute to the Plan, on behalf of each Participant who has made Salary Deferrals and/or Roth 401(k) Contributions, a Matching Contribution in an amount as the Employer determines, in its sole discretion, equal to a percentage of such
Participants Salary Deferrals and/or Roth 401(k) Contributions under Section 4.01(a) for the Plan Year. The Matching Contribution may be subject to such other limitations as the Employer deems appropriate for such Plan Year. No minimum
Hours of Service are required for a Participant to be eligible for a Matching Contribution. The matching rate that applies to a Participant shall be determined on the basis of the Participants classification as of the first day of the
applicable Plan Year to which the matching rate shall apply; provided, however, that if a Participants classification is projected to change during the Plan Year, such change in classification shall be deemed to occur on the first day of the
applicable Plan Year to which the matching rate shall apply. The matching rates shall be based on the Participants classification, the eligibility for which shall be determined by the Employer in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner, as
follows:  (1) A Participant who has attained the fifth anniversary of the later of his or her (i) Employment Commencement Date and
(ii) Reemployment Commencement Date shall receive a Matching Contribution equal to 100% of such Participants Salary Deferrals and/or Roth 401(k) Contributions, so long as such Salary Deferrals and/or Roth Contributions do not exceed 6% of
the Participants Compensation for the Plan Year;  (2) A Participant who has not yet attained the fifth anniversary of the later of
his or her (i) Employment Commencement Date and (ii) Reemployment Commencement Date shall receive a Matching Contribution equal to 100% of such Participants Salary Deferrals and/or Roth 401(k) Contributions, so long as such Salary
Deferrals and/or Roth Contributions do not exceed 3% of the Participants Compensation for the Plan Year; and 
   17 





 (3) A Participant who (i) was an active participant in the Pension Plan on October 1,
2007, (ii) elected to continue to accrue benefits under the Pension Plan and (iii) is not a Company Retirement Contribution Eligible Participant, shall receive a Matching Contribution equal to 100% of such Participants Salary
Deferrals and/or Roth 401(k) Contributions, so long as such Salary Deferrals and/or Roth Contributions do not exceed 6% of the Participants Compensation for the Plan Year. 
(b) Allocation. Matching Contributions made pursuant to this Section 4.05 shall be allocated to the Matching Contribution Accounts
of the Participants who are eligible to share in such contributions at such time as the Employer deems to be appropriate, in its sole discretion. If Matching Contributions are allocated prior to the end of the Plan Year, such allocations shall be
made to the Matching Contribution Accounts of the Participants who are otherwise eligible to receive them regardless of whether such Participant has a Severance from Service. 
(c) True-Up Matching Contribution. In the event that the Employer makes Matching Contributions more frequently than once per Plan Year,
the Employer may make a one-time True-Up Matching Contribution to a Participant for a Plan Year equal to the amount by which, if any, the sum of all prior Matching Contributions made during the Plan Year on behalf of the Participant is
less than the amount of the Matching Contribution that would have been made on behalf of the Participant if the Matching Contribution had been calculated and made only once at the end of the Plan Year. Unless otherwise determined by the Employer at
the time the Employer designates the nature and amount of the Matching Contribution, a Participant must be an Employee on the last day of a Plan Year in order to be eligible to receive a True-Up Matching Contribution for that Plan Year. 
4.06 Rollover Contributions. Subject to such uniform and nondiscriminatory procedures established by the Committee, the Plan shall
accept, as Rollover Contributions made on behalf of any Eligible Employee, cash equal to: (1) all or a portion of the amount (excluding after-tax contributions) received by the Eligible Employee as a distribution from, or
(2) an amount (excluding after-tax contributions) transferred directly to the Plan (pursuant to Code section 401(a)(31)) on the Eligible Employees behalf by the trustee of an eligible rollover plan as defined in Section 8.08, but
only if the deposit qualifies as a rollover as defined in Code section 402 (or Code section 408, with respect to a rollover from an individual retirement account under Code section 408(b)). Rollover Contributions may include Roth Rollover
Contributions but only to the extent that such amounts are transferred directly to the Plan on the Eligible Employees behalf by the trustee of an applicable retirement plan (as described in Code section 402A(e)(1)) and only to the
extent that the rollover is permitted under the rules of Code section 402(c). If the amount received does not qualify as a rollover, the amount (plus any earnings attributable thereto) shall be refunded to the Eligible Employee. To the extent not
attributable to Roth Rollover Contribution, Rollover Contributions shall be allocated to the Eligible Employees Rollover Account and invested in accordance with the provisions of ARTICLE VI. A Rollover Contribution that is a Roth Rollover
Contribution shall be allocated to the Eligible Employees Roth Rollover Account and invested in accordance with the provisions of ARTICLE VI; provided, however that any such Roth Rollover Contribution must be accompanied by a statement from
the plan administrator of the distributing plan indicating either (i) that the Roth Rollover Contribution is a qualified distribution within the meaning of Code section 402A or (ii) the first year of the five taxable year period for the
Eligible Employee and the portion of the distribution attributable to basis. 
   18 





 4.07 Qualified Nonelective Contributions and Qualified Matching Contributions. 
(a) Qualified Nonelective Contributions. Subject to the limitations described in ARTICLE V, the Employer may, in its discretion, make
Qualified Nonelective Contributions for a Plan Year, which shall be allocated within 12 months after the close of the Plan Year for which such contributions are related to the Qualified Nonelective Contribution Accounts of some or all of
those active Participants who are not Highly Compensated Employees for the Plan Year, as determined by the Employer at the time such contributions are made, in an amount necessary to satisfy at least one of the tests in Section 5.02.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Actual Deferral Percentages or Contribution Percentages of Participants who are not Highly Compensated Employees computed for the prior Plan Year are used in conducting the tests set forth in Section 5.02 for a
Plan Year, any Qualified Nonelective Contributions for the Plan Year shall be allocated no later than the end of the Plan Year being so tested. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Qualified Nonelective Contributions for a Plan Year shall be
allocated in one of the following methods:  (1) In the ratio in which each such Non-Highly Compensated Employees Compensation for
the Plan Year for which the Qualified Nonelective Contribution is being made bears to the total such Compensation of all such Non-Highly Compensated Employees for such Plan Year. 
(2) To the lowest-paid Participant or Participants, who are Non-Highly Compensated Employees, in an amount equal to the lesser of the amount
that, (A) when allocated to the Participant (alone, or in conjunction with either an allocation of Qualified Matching Contributions or a return of contributions under Section 5.03(a) or 5.03(b)), causes the nondiscrimination tests
described in Sections 5.02(a) and 5.02(b) to be satisfied for the Plan Year, (B) the amount that is equal to the maximum Annual Addition permitted under Section 5.04 that may be contributed for the Participant for the Plan Year, or
(C) for Plan Years beginning on or after January 1, 2006, the amount permitted to be allocated under Treas. Reg. § 1.401(k)-2(a)(6) or § 1.401(m)-2(a)(6), as applicable. 
(b) Qualified Matching Contributions. The Employer may, in its sole discretion, elect to make Qualified Matching
Contributions in any amount to satisfy any of the nondiscrimination tests described in Sections 5.02(a) and/or 5.02(b) for a Plan Year within 12 months after the close of the Plan Year to which such contribution relates. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if Actual Deferral Percentages or Contribution Percentages of Participants who are not Highly Compensated Employees computed for the prior Plan Year are used in conducting the tests set forth in Section 5.02 for a Plan Year, any
Qualified Matching Contributions for the Plan Year shall be allocated no later than the end of the Plan Year being so tested. Qualified Matching Contributions for a Plan Year shall be allocated to the Accounts of Participants who are Non-Highly
Compensated Employees and who would be eligible for an allocation of Matching Contributions in accordance with Section 4.05 and in the ratio in which the Salary Deferrals for such Plan Year of each Participant who is a Non-Highly Compensated
Employee and who is eligible for a Matching Contribution for such Plan Year bear to the total Salary Deferrals of all such Non-Highly Compensated Employees for such Plan Year. 
   19 





 (c) Other Corrections. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Qualified Nonelective Contributions
and Qualified Matching Contributions may also be made to facilitate correction under any Internal Revenue Service correction program.  4.08
Contributions With Respect to Military Service.  (a) Salary Deferral Contributions and Roth 401(k) Contributions. A
Participant who returns to employment with the Employer or an Affiliated Company following a period of Qualified Military Service shall be permitted to make additional Salary Deferrals and/or Roth 401(k) Contributions, within the limits described in
Section 4.01, up to an amount equal to the Salary Deferrals and/or Roth 401(k) Contributions that the Participant would have been permitted to contribute to the Plan if he had continued to be employed and received Compensation during the period
of Qualified Military Service. Salary Deferrals and Roth 401(k) Contributions under this Section may be made during the period that begins on the date such Participant returns to employment and which has the same length as the lesser of
(i) three multiplied by the period of Qualified Military Service and (ii) five years.  (b) Company Retirement
Contributions. The Employer shall contribute to the Plan, on behalf of each Participant who returns from Qualified Military Service as described in subsection (a) and who is a Company Retirement Contribution Eligible Participant, an amount
equal to the Company Retirement Contributions that would have been required under Section 4.04 had such Participant continued to be employed and received Compensation during the period of Qualified Military Service. 
(c) Matching Contributions. The Employer shall contribute to the Plan, on behalf of each Participant who has made Salary Deferrals
and/or Roth 401(k) Contributions under subsection (a), an amount equal to the Matching Contribution that would have been required under Section 4.05 had such Salary Deferrals and/or Roth 401(k) Contributions been made during the period of
Qualified Military Service.  (d) Qualified Nonelective Contributions and Qualified Matching Contributions. The Employer shall
contribute to the Plan, on behalf of each Participant who returns from Qualified Military Service as described in subsection (a), an amount equal to the Qualified Nonelective Contributions or Qualified Matching Contributions that would have been
required under Section 4.07 had such Participant continued to be employed and received Compensation during the period of Qualified Military Service. 
(e) Limitations on Contributions. To the extent required by Code sections 414(u) and 414(v), the Salary Deferrals, Roth 401(k)
Contributions, Company Retirement Contributions, Matching Contributions, Qualified Nonelective Contributions and Qualified Matching Contributions made under this Section shall be subject to the limitations described in ARTICLE V for the Plan Year to
which such contributions relate. 
   20 





 (f) Reduction of Amounts Contributed During Period of Qualified Military Service.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, any Salary Deferral, Roth 401(k) Contribution, Company Retirement Contribution, Matching Contribution, Qualified Nonelective Contributions or Qualified Matching Contributions made to the Plan
on behalf of a Participant while such Participant is on a period of Qualified Military Service shall reduce any Salary Deferral, Roth 401(k) Contribution, Company Retirement Contribution, Matching Contribution, Qualified Nonelective Contributions or
Qualified Matching Contributions that can be made on behalf of such Participant under the terms of this Section if the Participant returns to employment with the Employer or an Affiliated Company following a period of Qualified Military Service.
 4.09 Timing of Contributions. Company Retirement Contributions and Matching Contributions for any Plan Year under this Article
shall be made no later than the last date on which amounts so paid may be deducted for federal income tax purposes for the taxable year of the Employer in which the Plan Year ends. Except as otherwise set forth in Section 4.07, Qualified
Nonelective Contributions and Qualified Matching Contributions for any Plan Year shall be made no later than 12 months after the close of the Plan Year to which the contribution relates. Amounts contributed as Salary Deferrals and Roth 401(k)
Contributions shall be remitted to the Trustee as soon as administratively practicable following the month in which such contributions were withheld from the Participants Compensation. The requirements of this Section shall not apply to
contributions made pursuant to Section 4.08 with respect to Qualified Military Service.  4.10 Contingent Nature of
Contributions. Each contribution made by the Employer pursuant to the provisions of this Article is made expressly contingent on its deductibility for federal income tax purposes for the fiscal year with respect to which such contribution is
made, and no such contribution shall be made for any year to the extent it would exceed the deductible limit for such year as set forth in Code section 404. Contributions by the Employer or any Affiliated Company for any Employee who should have
been included as a Participant but was erroneously omitted, contributions necessary to satisfy the top heavy requirements of Code section 416, and contributions for reemployed Participants made to restore the undistributed portion of the reemployed
Participants account balance are not conditioned upon the deductibility of the contribution to the Employer or Affiliated Company. 
4.11 Exclusive Benefit; Refund of Contributions. All contributions made to the Plan are made for the exclusive benefit of the
Participants and their Beneficiaries, and such contributions shall not be used for, nor diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of the Participants and their Beneficiaries (including the costs of maintaining and administering the
Plan and corresponding trust). Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that such refunds do not, in themselves, deprive the Plan of its qualified status, refunds of contributions shall be made to the Employer under the following circumstances
and subject to the following limitations:  (a) Initial Nonqualification. If, upon the timely filing of a determination letter
application on the qualified status of the Plan, the Plan is determined not to initially satisfy the qualification requirements of Code section 401(a), and if the Employer declines to amend the Plan to satisfy such qualification requirements of Code
section 401(a), contributions made prior to the determination that the Plan has failed to qualify shall be returned to the Employer within one year of such determination. 
   21 





 (b) Disallowance of Deduction. To the extent that a federal income tax deduction is
disallowed, in whole or in part, for any contribution made by an Employer, or such contribution is otherwise nondeductible and recovery thereof is permitted, the Trustee shall refund to the Employer the amount so disallowed within one year of the
date of such disallowance or as otherwise permitted by applicable administrative rules.  (c) Mistake of Fact. In the case of a
contribution that is made in whole or in part by reason of a mistake of fact, so much of the Employer contribution as is attributable to the mistake of fact shall be returnable to the Employer upon demand, upon presentation of evidence of the
mistake of fact to the Trustee and of calculations as to the impact of such mistake. Demand and repayment must be effectuated within one year after the payment of the contribution to which the mistake applies. 
In the event that any refund is paid to the Employer hereunder, such refund shall be made without regard to net investment gains attributable
to the contribution, but shall be reduced to reflect net investment losses attributable thereto. 
   22 





 ARTICLE V 
LIMITATIONS ON CONTRIBUTIONS 
5.01 Calendar Year Limitation on Salary Deferrals and Roth 401(k) Contributions. 
(a) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Salary Deferrals and Roth 401(k) Contributions made on behalf of an active
Participant under this Plan together with elective deferrals (as defined in Code section 402(g)) and Roth deferrals made under any other plan or arrangement maintained by the Employer or an Affiliated Company shall not exceed such amount as is
applicable for a calendar year under Code section 402(g) and the Treasury Regulations thereunder for any calendar year (including, if applicable, the amount of Salary Deferrals permitted to be made pursuant to Section 4.01(b) of the Plan for a
calendar year as catch-up contributions under Code section 414(v)). Participants who formerly participated in another plan not maintained by the Employer or an Affiliated Company prior to their Employment Commencement Date may notify the Plan
Administrator of such prior plan participation and shall provide documentation of any contributions credited under such prior plan. Furthermore, should a Participant claim that his Salary Deferrals and/or Roth 401(k) Contributions under this Plan
when added to his other elective deferrals under any other plan or arrangement (whether or not maintained by an Employer or an Affiliated Company) exceed the limit imposed by Code section 402(g) for the calendar year in which the deferrals occurred,
the Committee shall distribute, by April 15 of the following calendar year, the amount of Salary Deferrals (including, if applicable, Salary Deferrals made pursuant to Section 4.01(b) as catch-up contributions) and/or Roth 401(k)
Contributions specified in the Participants claim, plus income thereon determined in the manner described in Section 5.03(c) or recharacterize such excess Salary Deferrals as Salary Deferrals contributed pursuant to Section 4.01(b)
to the extent permitted by Code section 414(v) and regulations issued thereunder. The Participants claim shall be in writing and shall be submitted to the Committee prior to March 1 following the calendar year in which such deferrals
occurred. A Participant shall be deemed to have made a claim for distribution of excess deferrals from the Plan to the extent that his Salary Deferrals and/or Roth 401(k) Contributions together with his elective deferrals under any other plan or
arrangement maintained by the Employer or an Affiliated Company exceed the limit imposed by Code section 402(g) for the calendar year. For purposes of determining the necessary reduction, (1) Salary Deferrals previously distributed pursuant to
Section 5.03(a) or returned to the Participant pursuant to Section 5.04 shall be treated as distributed under this Section, and (2) Salary Deferrals not taken into account in determining Matching Contributions under Section 4.05 shall
be reduced first.  (b) In the event a Participant receives a distribution of excess Salary Deferrals and/or Roth 401(k) Contributions
pursuant to subsection (a), the Participant shall forfeit any Matching Contributions (plus income thereon determined as described in Section 5.03(c)) allocated to the Participant by reason of the distributed Salary Deferrals and/or Roth 401(k)
Contributions. Amounts forfeited shall be used first to reduce future Matching Contributions made pursuant to Section 4.05 and then Company Retirement Contributions made pursuant to Section 4.04. 
   23 





 5.02 Nondiscrimination Limitations on Salary Deferrals, Roth 401(k) Contributions, and
Matching Contributions.  (a) Salary Deferral and Roth 401(k) Contribution Limitations. With respect to Salary Deferrals for any
Plan Year (excluding Salary Deferrals contributed pursuant to Section 4.01(b)) and Roth 401(k) Contributions, one of the following tests must be satisfied: 
(1) The Average Actual Deferral Percentage for active Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees for the Plan Year shall not exceed the
Average Actual Deferral Percentage for all other active Participants for the Plan Year multiplied by 1.25; or  (2) The Average Actual
Deferral Percentage for active Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees for the Plan Year shall not exceed the Average Actual Deferral Percentage for all other active Participants for the Plan Year multiplied by two; provided, that the
Average Actual Deferral Percentage for such Highly Compensated Employees does not exceed the applicable Average Actual Deferral Percentage for all other active Participants by more than two percentage points. 
(b) Matching Contribution Limitations. With respect to Matching Contributions for any Plan Year, one of the following tests must be
satisfied:  (1) The Average Contribution Percentage for active Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees for the Plan Year shall
not exceed the Average Contribution Percentage for all other active Participants for the Plan Year multiplied by 1.25; or  (2) The Average
Contribution Percentage for active Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees for the Plan Year shall not exceed the Average Contribution Percentage for all other active Participants for the Plan Year multiplied by two; provided, that the
Average Contribution Percentage for such Highly Compensated Employees does not exceed the applicable Average Contribution Percentage for all other active Participants by more than two percentage points. 
(c) For purposes of subsections (a) and (b), this Plan shall be aggregated and treated as a single plan with other plans maintained by the
Employer or an Affiliated Company to the extent that this Plan is aggregated with any such other plan for purposes of satisfying Code section 410(b) (other than Code section 410(b)(2)(A)(ii)). 
(d) If the Committee elects to apply Code section 410(b)(4)(B) in determining whether Salary Deferrals and any Qualified Nonelective
Contributions and Qualified Matching Contributions treated as Salary Deferrals under Section 4.07 meet the requirements of Section 5.02(a) or determining whether Matching Contributions (other than Qualified Matching Contributions treated
as Salary Deferrals for the Plan Year under Section 4.07) meet the requirements of Section 5.02(b), the Committee may either exclude from consideration all Participants (other than Highly Compensated Employees) who have not met the minimum
age and service requirements of Code section 410(a)(1)(A), or disaggregate the Employees who have not met such minimum age and service requirements and test them separately. 
   24 





 (e) The determination and treatment of the Salary Deferrals, Roth 401(k) Contributions, Matching
Contributions, Qualified Nonelective Contributions, and Qualified Matching Contributions, Actual Deferral Percentage and Contribution Percentage of any Participant shall satisfy such other requirements as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the
Treasury.  5.03 Correction of Discriminatory Contributions. 
(a) If the nondiscrimination tests of Section 5.02(a) are not satisfied with respect to Salary Deferrals for any Plan Year, the Committee
shall (1) determine the amount by which the Actual Deferral Percentage for the Highly Compensated Employee or Employees with the highest Actual Deferral Percentage for the Plan Year would need to be reduced to comply with the limit in
Section 5.02(a); (2) convert the excess percentage amount determined under clause (1) into a dollar amount; and (3) reduce the Salary Deferrals of the Highly Compensated Employee or Employees with the greatest dollar amount of
Salary Deferrals by the lesser of (A) the amount by which the Highly Compensated Employees Salary Deferrals exceeds the Salary Deferrals of the Highly Compensated Employee with the next highest dollar amount of Salary Deferrals or
(B) the amount of the excess dollar amount determined under clause (2). This process shall be repeated until the Salary Deferrals of Highly Compensated Employees have been reduced by an amount equal to the excess dollar amount determined under
clause (2). The Salary Deferrals of any Highly Compensated Employee which must be reduced pursuant to this subsection (a) shall be reduced (i) first, by distributing Salary Deferrals not taken into account in determining Matching
Contributions under Section 4.05, and (ii) then, by distributing Salary Deferrals not described in clause (i), within 12 months of the close of the Plan Year with respect to which the reduction applies, and the provisions of
Section 5.01(b) regarding the forfeiture of related Matching Contributions shall apply. For purposes of determining the necessary reduction, Salary Deferrals previously distributed pursuant to Section 5.01 shall be treated as distributed
under this Section 5.03(a) and Salary Deferrals contributed pursuant to Section 4.01(b) shall not be taken into account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the election of the Committee and in accordance with rules uniformly applicable to
all affected Participants, the Actual Deferral Percentage reduction described in this Section may be accomplished, in whole or in part, by recharacterizing excess Salary Deferrals as Salary Deferrals contributed pursuant to Section 4.01(b) to
the extent permitted by Code section 414(v) and regulations issued thereunder. For purposes of this subsection (a), Roth 401(k) Contributions shall be treated in the same manner as Salary Deferrals. To the extent the Participant made both Salary
Deferrals and Roth 401(k) Contributions to the Plans, excess amounts shall be distributed from the Participants Salary Deferral Account before the Participants Roth 401(k) Contribution Account. 
(b) If the nondiscrimination tests of Section 5.02(b) are not satisfied with respect to Matching Contributions for any Plan Year, the
Committee shall (1) determine the amount by which the Actual Contribution Percentage for the Highly Compensated Employee or Employees with the highest Actual Contribution Percentage for the Plan Year would need to be reduced to comply with the
limit in Section 5.02(b); (2) convert the excess percentage amount determined under clause (1) into a dollar amount; and (3) reduce the excess contributions of the Highly Compensated Employee or Employees with the greatest dollar
amount of Matching Contributions by the lesser of (A) the amount by which the dollar amount of the affected Highly Compensated Employees Matching Contributions exceeds the dollar amount of the Matching 
   25 





 
Contributions of the Highly Compensated Employee with the next highest dollar amount of Matching Contributions or (B) the amount of the excess dollar amount determined under clause (2). This
process shall be repeated until the Matching Contributions of the Highly Compensated Employees has been reduced by an amount equal to the excess dollar amount determined under clause (2). The Matching Contributions of any Highly Compensated Employee
that must be reduced pursuant to this subsection (b) shall be reduced by distributing Matching Contributions (or forfeiting such Matching Contributions if the Participant is not vested in such amounts), within 12 months of the close of the Plan
Year with respect to which the reduction applies. Amounts forfeited under this subsection (b) shall be applied in the following order of priority: (i) first, to restore a reemployed Participants Account as provided under Section 7.04
and to restore the Account of a Participant who was unlocatable as provided under Section 15.12, (ii) next, to reduce future Matching Contributions made pursuant to Section 4.05, (iii) next, to reduce future Company Retirement
Contributions made pursuant to Section 4.04, (iv) next, to satisfy the top-heavy minimum allocation provisions under Section 10.03, (v) next, to provide Qualified Nonelective Contributions or Qualified Matching Contributions
under Section 4.07, and (vi) to reduce the reasonable expenses of the administration of the Plan.  (c) Any distribution,
recharacterization or forfeiture of Salary Deferrals, Roth 401(k) Contributions or Matching Contributions necessary pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) shall include a distribution or forfeiture of the income, if any, allocable to such
contributions. Such income shall be equal to the allocable gain or loss for the Plan Year (determined by multiplying the income allocable to the Participants Salary Deferrals, Roth 401(k) Contributions or Matching Contributions, as applicable,
for the Plan Year by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Participants excess Salary Deferrals, Roth 401(k) Contributions or Matching Contributions, as applicable, for the Plan Year and the denominator is the sum of the Participants
Salary Deferral Account, Roth 401(k) Account or Matching Contribution Account, as applicable, as of the beginning of the Plan Year plus any contributions made to the applicable Account during the Plan Year). 
(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, for any Highly Compensated Employee who is an active Participant in the Plan
while eligible to participate in any other qualified retirement plan maintained by the Employer or an Affiliated Company (excluding any such plan which is not permitted to be aggregated with the Plan pursuant to Treas. Reg. §1.401(k)-1(b)(4))
under which the Employee has made employee contributions or elective deferrals, or is credited with employer matching contributions for the year, the Committee shall coordinate corrective actions under this Plan and such other plan for the year.
 (e) In lieu of or in addition to the actions described in subsections (a) through (d) of this Section, to satisfy the tests in
Section 5.02, the Employer may make Qualified Nonelective Contributions or Qualified Matching Contributions as described in Section 4.07. 
5.04 Annual Additions Limitations. In no event shall the Annual Addition on behalf of any Participant for any Plan Year exceed the
lesser of:  (1) $40,000, adjusted in accordance with Code section 415(d), or 
(2) 100% of such Participants Compensation for the Plan Year. 
   26 





 The limitation referred to in subsection (2) above shall not apply to any contribution for
medical benefits within the meaning of Code section 401(h) or 419A(f)(2) which is otherwise treated as an Annual Addition under Code section 415(l)(1) or 419A(d)(2). 
If the amount otherwise allocable to the Account of a Participant would exceed the amount described above as a result of the reallocation of
forfeitures (if any available), a reasonable error in estimating the Participants Compensation, a reasonable error in determining the amount of elective deferrals (within the meaning of Code section 402(g)) that may be made under the
limitations of Code section 415, or such other circumstances as permitted by law, the Committee shall take the following steps to correct such violation: 
(a) First, the Committee shall reduce the Annual Addition under this Plan by determining the portion, if any, of such excess amount that is
attributable to the Participants Salary Deferrals, Roth 401(k) Contributions, Matching Contributions, Company Retirement Contributions, Qualified Nonelective Contributions and/or Qualified Matching Contributions, if any, until such excess
amount has been exhausted. To the extent any portion of a Participants Salary Deferrals or Roth 401(k) Contributions are determined to be excess under this Section, such Salary Deferrals or Roth 401(k) Contributions, with income thereon, shall
be returned to the Participant as soon as administratively practicable; provided, however, that excess Salary Deferrals and Roth 401(k) Contributions under this Section may be recharacterized as made under Section 4.01(b) to the extent
permitted under Code section 414(v) and regulations issued thereunder. To the extent any portion of the Matching Contributions, Company Retirement Contributions, Qualified Nonelective Contributions and/or Qualified Matching Contributions allocable
to a Participant are determined to be excess under this Section, while the Participant remains an Eligible Employee, his excess Matching Contributions, Company Retirement Contributions, Qualified Nonelective Contributions and/or Qualified Matching
Contributions shall be held in a suspense account (which shall share in investment gains and losses of the Fund) by the Trustee until the following Plan Year (or any succeeding Plan Years), at which time such amounts shall be allocated to the
Participants Account before any Matching Contributions, Company Retirement Contributions, Qualified Nonelective Contributions and/or Qualified Matching Contributions are made on his behalf for the Plan Year. When the Participant ceases to be
an Eligible Employee, his excess Matching Contributions, Company Retirement Contributions, Qualified Nonelective Contributions and/or Qualified Matching Contributions held in the suspense account shall be allocated in the following Plan Year (or any
succeeding Plan Years) to the Accounts of other Participants in the Plan. Furthermore, the Committee shall perform any other actions as may be necessary to preserve the Plans status as a qualified plan. 
(b) Second, the Annual Addition shall be reduced under such other plans as may be maintained by the Employer in accordance with the provisions
set forth therein.  (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any distribution of amounts otherwise allocable to the Account of a Participant as
described above shall be made in accordance with the rules and procedures set forth in Rev. Proc. 2008-50 (or, effective April 1, 2013, Rev. Proc. 2013-12) and any successor thereto.

 ARTICLE VI 
INVESTMENT AND VALUATION OF TRUST FUND; 
MAINTENANCE OF ACCOUNTS 
6.01 Investment of Assets. All existing assets of the Trust Fund and all future contributions shall be invested by the Trustee in
accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement and Section 6.02.  6.02 Investment in Investment Funds. 
(a) General. Except as provided in subsection (b) and (c) hereof, the Investment Committee shall designate the available
Investment Funds to which a Participant shall direct the investment of amounts credited to his Account. The Investment Committee, in its sole discretion, may from time to time designate additional Investment Funds of the same or different types or
modify, cease to offer or eliminate any existing Investment Funds. A portion of the Trust Fund, as determined by the Investment Committee, may be held in the form of uninvested cash or in a liquid asset account for temporary periods pending
reinvestment, distribution, or for other liquidity purposes.  (b) Company Common Stock Fund Status as Employee Stock Ownership Plan.
The Company Common Stock Fund constitutes an employee stock ownership plan for purposes of Code section 4975(e)(7). Consistent with the requirements of Code section 4975(e)(7) and applicable law, it is the Companys intent that the
Company Common Stock Fund shall be a permanent investment option with respect to the Plan that invests primarily in the Companys Common Stock without regard to considerations relating to: (1) diversification of assets, (2) the risk
of investments in Company Common Stock, (3) the amount of income provided by Company Common Stock, and (iv) the fluctuation in the fair market value of Company Common Stock. As such, except to the extent otherwise required by applicable
law, the Investment Committee shall not have the authority to remove the Company Common Stock Fund from the Plan.  (c) Default
Investment Funds. The Company designates the age appropriate Target Date Retirement Fund (the Target Fund) as the Investment Fund that shall be the default investment fund for purposes of Participants (by reason of
the automatic enrollment provisions of Section 4.01 or otherwise) who do not make an affirmative election in accordance with Section 6.03 to invest all or a portion of their Account among the Plans available Investment Funds. The
Target Fund is an Investment Fund that provides a mixture of fixed income and equity investments that are matched to an individuals age and assumed retirement age of 65. The Target Fund is the Investment Fund that the Company has designated as
the Plans qualified default investment alternative for purposes of section 404(c)(5) of ERISA.  6.03 Investment
Elections. Each Participant, upon commencing or recommencing active participation under Section 4.01, shall direct, in the form and at the time prescribed by the Committee, the investment of contributions made on his behalf in any one or
more of the available Investment Funds in accordance with such uniform and non-discriminatory procedures and limitations as the Committee may prescribe. Without limiting a Participants rights pursuant 
   28 





 
to reallocate his Company Retirement Contribution Account pursuant to Section 6.05, the Committee may prescribe the Investment Funds that are available for the investment of the Company
Retirement Contributions at the time they are contributed to the Plan and allocated to the Company Retirement Contribution Accounts of the Company Retirement Contribution Eligible Participants. 
6.04 Change of Election. Each Participant may change his investment direction with respect to the investment of his future contributions
at the time or times prescribed by the Committee, by making a new election in such form, at such time in advance, and in accordance with other uniform and non-discriminatory procedures and subject to such restrictions as the Committee or its
delegate may prescribe.  6.05 Transfers Between Investment Funds. Subject to such limits as imposed by the Investment Committee, a
Participant may reallocate his entire Account among and between the available Investment Funds (subject to such specific rules and limits applicable to the Company Common Stock Fund as described in Section 6.09) at any time. Each Participant
may elect to make such transfers at the time or times prescribed by the Committee, by making a transfer election in such form, at such time in advance, and in accordance with other uniform and non-discriminatory procedures and subject to such
restrictions as the Committee or its delegate may prescribe or as may otherwise be imposed by the Investment Fund(s) involved in the transfer. 
6.06 Individual Accounts. There shall be maintained on the books of the Plan with respect to each Participant, an Account with such
separate sub-accounts as are necessary to account for the types and amounts contributions made to and by the Participant under the Plan. Each such Account and sub-account shall separately reflect the Participants interest in each Investment
Fund relating to such Account and sub-account. Each Participant shall receive, at periodic intervals, a statement of his Account showing the balances in each Investment Fund. A Participants interest in any Investment Fund shall be determined
and accounted for based on his beneficial interest in any such fund, and no Participant shall have any interest in or rights to any specific asset of any Investment Fund. 
6.07 Valuation. As of each Valuation Date, the Trustee shall adjust the net credit balance of each Participants Account, in the
respective investment fund of the Trust Fund, upward or downward, pro rata, so that the aggregate of such unit credit balances will equal the net worth of each Investment Fund of the Trust Fund as of that Valuation Date, using fair market values as
determined by the Trustee.  6.08 Voting and Tender of Mutual Fund Shares. To the extent that shares of one or more of the regulated
investment companies offered by the Investment Funds are allocated to Participants Accounts, the Trustee shall vote or tender such shares solely in accordance with written instructions furnished to it by each Participant (or Beneficiary of a
deceased Participant); provided, that the Trustee shall be responsible for delivery to each Participant (or Beneficiary of a deceased Participant) of all notices, proxies and proxy soliciting materials related to any such shares. Any such
instructions shall remain in the strict confidence of the Trustee. Shares, including fractional shares, for which voting or tender instructions are not received shall not be voted or tendered. 
   29 





 6.09 Special Rules for Company Common Stock Fund. 
(a) Investment in Company Common Stock Fund. A Participant, other than a Participant who is an Employee of a Participating Employer,
shall be eligible to direct investment of a percentage, in an amount up to 15%, of Salary Deferrals, Roth 401(k) Contributions and/or Rollover Contributions into the Company Common Stock Fund. No Participant may direct the investment of any of his
then-existing Account balances into the Company Common Stock Fund. To the extent that Matching Contributions are made on Salary Deferrals and/or Roth 401(k) Contribution that are directed for investment into the Company Common Stock Fund, such
Matching Contributions shall automatically be directed for investment into the Company Common Stock Fund. A Participants investment in the Company Common Stock Fund shall be credited to his Company Common Stock Account. 
(b) Diversification of Company Common Stock. A Participant may elect to reallocate up to 100% of the Company Common Stock Fund held in
his Company Common Stock Account to any one or more of the Investment Funds at any time.  (c) Sale, Purchase and Valuation of Company
Common Stock. The Trustee shall either sell or buy Company Common Stock as provided in this Section 6.09 within a reasonable time following receipt of any such direction, considering all of the then-existing market conditions with respect
to the Company Common Stock. Upon receiving direction to sell or buy Company Common Stock, such direction shall remain in effect until completed, and the Participant may not cancel such previous direction. If the Trustee determines that such
quotations or trading prices do not accurately reflect the market value, the fair market value of the Company Common Stock as of the Valuation Date shall be determined by an independent appraiser meeting requirements similar to the requirements of
the Department of Labor Regulations promulgated under section 3(18) of ERISA  (d) Special Rule Regarding Appraisal of Company Common
Stock. If at any time the Company Common Stock held in the Company Common Stock Fund is not readily tradable on an established securities market, all valuations of such Company Common Stock with respect to activities carried on by the Plan shall
be made by an independent appraiser meeting the requirements of Code section 401(a)(28).  (e) Dividends on Company Common Stock
Fund. A Participant may make an election, in accordance with the uniform and non-discriminatory procedures prescribed by the Committee that provide such opportunity no less frequently than annually, that all cash dividends paid by the Company
with respect to shares of Company Common Stock held in the Company Common Stock Fund and allocated to such Participants Company Common Stock Account on the record date for the dividend shall either be reinvested in the Company Common Stock
Fund or distributed to the Participant. A Participant who does not make an affirmative election to receive dividends in cash will be deemed to have chosen to have those dividends reinvested into the Company Common Stock Fund. Notwithstanding
anything in the Plan to the contrary, a Participant shall have a fully (100%) vested and nonforfeitable interest in any cash dividends paid by the Company with respect to shares of Company Common Stock held in the Company Common Stock Fund.

   30 





 (f) Voting of Company Common Stock. All whole and fractional shares of Company Common
Stock allocated to a Participants or Beneficiarys Company Common Stock Account shall be voted by the Trustee as the Participant or Beneficiary directs in writing from time to time. The Trustee shall solicit the directions from each
Participant or Beneficiary before each annual or special stockholders meeting of the Company, from each Member. Upon timely receipt of the directions, the Trustee shall vote those shares in accordance with the directions received. Unless
otherwise provided in the Trust Agreement, shares for which timely receipt of directions is not received shall not be voted by the Trustee. 
(g) Tender of Company Common Stock. The Trustee, in its sole discretion, shall determine the manner in which to respond to any offer to
purchase, exchange or otherwise dispose of Company Common Stock made by any person or entity other than a Participant or Beneficiary. If the Company Common Stock is sold, exchanged or disposed of, the proceeds shall be reinvested in the Company
Common Stock Fund.  (h) Distribution of Company Common Stock. When a Participant is entitled to a distribution of his Account under
the Plan, the Participant may elect to receive either cash or Company Common Stock that is allocated to his Company Common Stock Account. If cash is to be received from the Company Common Stock Account, then, the Trustee will use reasonable efforts
to sell such Company Common Stock and the proceeds from such sale (less all reasonable expenses incurred in such sale) will be distributed to the Participant. If the Participant elects to receive shares of Company Common Stock, then the shares of
Company Common Stock plus cash in lieu of fractional shares (less all reasonable expenses incurred in such sale) will be distributed to the Participant. 
(i) Put Option. If the Company Common Stock held in the Company Common Stock Fund is not readily tradable on an established securities
market (within the meaning of Code section 409(h)(1)(B)), any Participant who is entitled to a distribution of such Company Common Stock shall have the right to require the Company to repurchase such Company Common Stock in accordance with Code
section 409(h) and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.  (j) Special Rules. The Company has established the Company
Common Stock Fund to be, and currently intends the Company Common Stock Fund remain, an unleveraged employee stock ownership plan with respect to qualifying employer securities that are publically traded within the meaning of Treas. Reg. §
54.4975-7(b)(iv). In the event that an exempt loan is used to acquire any portion of the Company Common Stock Fund or if the Company Common Stock ceases to be publically traded or is subject to a trading limitation when distributed, or if the
Company becomes an S corporation, the Company Common Stock Fund and any exempt loan will be administered, notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, in accordance with Code section 409 (including, without limitation, Code sections
409(h)(2) and 409(p)) and Treas. Reg. §§ 54.4975-7 and 54.4975-11 (including, without limitation, Treas. Reg. § 54975-11(a)(3)). 
6.10 Fiduciary Responsibility. This Plan is intended to constitute a plan described in section 404(c) of ERISA, and Title 29 of the Code
of Federal Regulations § 2550.404c-1. Neither the Company, an Employer, the Committee, the Investment Committee, the Trustee nor any other Plan fiduciary shall be liable for any losses that are the direct and necessary result of investment
instructions provided by any Participant, Beneficiary or Alternate Payee. 
   31 





 6.11 Transfer of Employment to a Participating Employer. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, any Employee (hereinafter referred to as Transferring Employee) who transfers his employment with one Employer (hereinafter referred to as Old Employer) who is participating in this Plan to
another Employer (hereinafter referred to as New Employer) who is participating in this Plan, then, such transfer of employment shall not be considered an interruption of employment, and, if such Employee is a Participant, his
Accounts (Transferred Accounts) shall be transferred within the Trust Fund to reflect such transfer of employment to the New Employer. Years of Service with the Old Employer shall be treated as Years of Service with the New
Employer for all purposes under the Plan; and, the Transferred Accounts of each Transferring Employee which are transferred as provided herein will be maintained as the separate Transferred Account of such Transferring Employee, and no further
contributions will be made by the New Employer to the Transferred Account attributable to such Transferring Employee. 
   32

   33 





 7.03 Effects of Certain Periods of Severance. 
(a) If a Participant had a vested interest in his Account at the time he incurred a Period of Severance and he is later reemployed by the
Company or an Affiliated Company, his Years of Service before his Period of Severance shall be taken into account for purposes of determining his vested interest in his Account. 
(b) If a Participant had no vested interest in his Account at the time he incurred a Period of Severance and he is later reemployed by the
Company or an Affiliated Company, his Years of Service before his Period of Severance shall be taken into account for purposes of determining his vested interest in his Account only if he (1) completes a Year of Service as described in

(c) Notwithstanding anything in subsection (a) or (b) to the contrary, if a Participant or Employee has incurred five or more
consecutive Periods of Severance, under no circumstances shall his Years of Service after he again completes an Hour of Service be counted in determining his vested interest in the portion of his Account attributable to periods before his Period of
Severance.  7.04 Forfeiture of Nonvested Amounts and Restoration upon Reemployment. 
(a) The Account of a Participant who has had a Severance from Service shall be closed, and the forfeitable amount held therein shall be
forfeited on the earlier of:  (1) the date on which he receives a distribution of his entire vested interest in his Account (for these
purposes, a Participant who incurs a Severance from Service without a vested interest in his Account shall be deemed to have received a distribution of his entire vested interest in his Account on the date of his Severance from Service); or 
(2) the fifth anniversary of his Severance Date. 
(b) Amounts forfeited from a Participants Account under subsection (a) shall be applied in the following order of priority:
(1) first, to reduce the reasonable expenses of the administration of the Plan that are not otherwise paid by the Employer or satisfied through other means; (2) next, to restore a reemployed Participants Account as provided under
this Section and to restore the Account of a Participant who could not be located as provided under Section 15.12, (3) next, to reduce future Matching Contributions made pursuant to Section 4.05, (4) next, to reduce future Company

provisions under Section 10.03.  (c) If a Participant who has received a distribution described in subsection (a)(1), whereby any part
of his Account has been forfeited, again becomes an Eligible Employee prior to the fifth anniversary of his Severance Date, the amount so forfeited shall be restored (unadjusted by any subsequent gains and losses) to his Account; provided, that the
Participant repays to the Trustee the full amount of any such distribution prior to the fifth anniversary of the date such Participant again becomes an Eligible Employee. Amounts restored under this subsection (c) shall be funded through
current forfeitures or additional contributions by the Participants Employer.

(b) Time of Distribution. Death benefits shall be paid to the Participants Beneficiary as soon as practicable after the

Regulatory Requirements. Distributions under this Section shall otherwise comply with the requirements of Code section 401(a)(9), including the incidental death benefit requirements, in accordance with the final Treasury Regulations under

(b) Time of Distribution. 
(1) General Rule. Distribution of benefits under this Section to the Participant shall be made as soon as practicable after the
Participants Severance from Service; provided, however, that in the case of a Participant whose vested Account balance exceeds $5,000, no distribution shall be made at such time without the written consent of the Participant. If the
Participant does not so consent, then distribution will be deferred until any subsequent date elected by the Participant in writing or such other manner acceptable to the Committee pursuant to such uniform and non-discriminatory procedures as the
Committee may impose; provided, however, that benefit payments shall begin no later than the applicable date under Section 8.02(b)(3). 
(2) Cash Out of Amounts of $5,000 or Less. In the event a Participants vested Account balance (excluding amounts attributable to

Participant as soon as practicable after the Participants Severance from 
   35 





 Service; provided, however, that, for cash outs pursuant to this subsection (2), if such Account balance is
greater than $1,000 and the Participant does not consent to the distribution of such Account balance, then the Committee shall pay the distribution in a direct rollover described in Section 8.08 to an individual retirement plan of a designated
trustee or insurer selected by the Committee, in its sole discretion, for such purposes.  (3) Required Distribution Dates. 
(A) Except as otherwise elected by the Participant or provided in this Section, the Benefit Payment Date for any Participant shall not be

(C) Distributions under this Section 8.02 shall otherwise comply with the requirements of Code section 401(a)(9) and the final
regulations published thereunder on April 17, 2002, including the incidental death benefit requirements of Treas. Reg. §1.401(a)(9)-5. 
(c) Election Period. A Participants election to commence payment must be made within the 180-day period ending on the Benefit
Payment Date elected by the Participant and in no event earlier than the date the Committee provides the Participant with written information relating to his right to defer payment and his right to make a direct rollover as set forth in
Section 8.08. Such information must be supplied not less than 30 days or more than 180 days prior to the Benefit Payment Date. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a Participants Benefit Payment Date may occur less than 30 days after
such information has been supplied to the Participant; provided, that, after the Participant has received such information and has been advised of his right to a 30-day period to make a decision regarding the distribution, the Participant
affirmatively elects a distribution.  8.03 Form and Timing of Benefit Payment. A Participants Account shall be distributed to
the Participant or his Beneficiaries in cash in the form of either (a) a single, lump sum or (b) substantially equal payments in monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual installments for a period less than the life expectancy of the
Participant or his Beneficiaries, as the case may be; provided, however, that portion of a withdrawal or distribution consisting of the Company Common Stock Fund shall be made in either cash or stock, as the Participant or his Beneficiaries may
elect. Any fractional shares of Company Common Stock will be paid in cash. 
   36 





 8.04 Withdrawals. A Participant may, in the manner prescribed by the Committee, request a
withdrawal from his Account in accordance with the following rules:  (a) In-Service Withdrawals. 
(1) Upon written application submitted to the Committee, a Participant who has attained age
591/2 may withdraw up to 100% of his vested Accounts. A Participant may direct the vested Accounts from which a withdrawal pursuant to this
paragraph shall be made; provided, however, that a from Accounts attributable to Employer contributions shall be taken from the Participants vested Matching Contribution Account and Company Retirement Contribution Account on a pro-rata basis.
The portion of a withdrawal consisting of the Company Common Stock Fund shall be made in either cash or stock, as the Participant may elect. Any fractional shares of Company Common Stock will be paid in cash. 
(2) Upon written application submitted to the Committee, a Participant may withdraw up to 100% of his Rollover Account and/or Roth Rollover
Account.  (b) Hardship Withdrawals. Each Participant who has exhausted all of his or her withdrawal rights under subsection
(a) hereof, and any in-service withdrawal rights set forth in an Appendix hereto, shall have the right to make a withdrawal from his Salary Deferral Account and Roth 401(k) Account. If the Committee determines that a requested withdrawal is on
account of an immediate and heavy financial need of the Participant, and the withdrawal is necessary to satisfy such financial need, the Committee shall permit the Participant to withdraw all or a portion of his Salary Deferral Account and Roth
401(k) Account; provided, however, that the aggregate amount of a Participants withdrawals from each of his Salary Deferral Account and Roth 401(k) Account shall not exceed the Participants undistributed Salary Deferrals or Roth 401(k)
Contributions, respectively. For Participants with both a Salary Deferral Account and a Roth 401(k) Account, withdrawals shall be taken from such accounts on a pro-rata basis. 
(1) A distribution shall be deemed to be on account of an immediate and heavy financial need of a Participant when the distribution is on
account of:  (A) expenses incurred or necessary for medical care of the Participant, the Participants Spouse, or any dependents of
the Participant that would be deductible under Code section 213(d) (determined without regard to whether the expenses exceed 7.5% of adjusted gross income); 
(B) the purchase (excluding mortgage payments) of a principal residence for the Participant; 
(C) the payment of tuition, related educational fees and room and board for up to the next 12 months of post-secondary education for the

(D) expenses for the repair of damage to the Participants principal residence that would qualify for the casualty deduction under Code
section 165 (determined without regard to whether the loss exceeds 10% of adjusted gross income);  (E) the need to prevent the eviction of
the Participant from, or foreclosure on the mortgage of, the Participants principal residence; 
   37 





 (F) payments for burial or funeral expenses for the Participants deceased parent, Spouse,
children or dependents (as defined in Code section 152 and without regarding to Code section 152(d)(1)(B));  (G) federal, state or local
income taxes or penalties reasonably anticipated to result from the distribution; or  (H) such other circumstances as may be prescribed by
the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate.  (2) A withdrawal shall be necessary to satisfy the financial need of a Participant if:
 (A) a Participant making such application represents in writing to the Committee that he has an immediate and heavy financial need, that
the amount requested to be withdrawn is necessary to relieve such need, and that such need cannot be relieved:  (B) through reimbursement
or compensation by insurance or otherwise;  (C) by reasonable liquidation of the Participants assets, including those assets of his
Spouse and minor children that are reasonably available to him, to the extent such liquidation would not itself cause an immediate and heavy financial need; 
(D) by cessation of Salary Deferrals and/or Roth 401(k) Contributions; or 
(E) by other currently available distributions or nontaxable (at the time of the loan) loans from this Plan or any other plan maintained by
the Employer or by any other employer, or by borrowing from commercial sources on reasonable commercial terms, in an amount sufficient to satisfy the need. 
(3) If the Participant does not represent in writing to the Committee that he has an immediate and heavy financial need, a withdrawal shall be
deemed necessary to satisfy the financial need of a Participant if:  (A) the amount of the withdrawal does not exceed the amount of the
Participants immediate and heavy financial need, including, at the election of the Participant, any amounts necessary to pay any federal, state or local income taxes or penalties reasonably anticipated to result from the distribution; 
(B) the Participant has obtained all currently available distributions (including, if currently available pursuant to Section 6.09(e), by
electing to receive dividend distributions in cash, but other than hardship distributions) and non-taxable loans under this Plan, if applicable, and all other qualified retirement plans maintained by the Employer and all Affiliated Companies, unless
the Participant certifies that the amount that may be obtained through all currently permissible distributions and non-taxable loans under this Plan shall not be sufficient to satisfy the financial need; and 
(C) the Participant agrees to be bound by the rules of subsection (4)below. 
   38 





 (4) If the Participant withdraws any amount from his Salary Deferral Account and/or Roth 401(k)
Account pursuant to Section 8.03, or withdraws any elective deferrals under any other qualified retirement plan maintained by the Employer or an Affiliated Company which other plan conditions such withdrawal upon the Participants being
subject to rules similar to those stated in this paragraph (4), such Participant may not make Salary Deferrals and/or Roth 401(k) Contributions under this Plan or employee contributions (other than mandatory contributions under a defined benefit
plan) or, to the extent required by applicable law, elective deferrals under any other plan of deferred compensation maintained by the Employer or an Affiliated Company for a period of six months commencing on the date of his receipt of the
withdrawal.  (c) All withdrawals shall be made in a single sum payment. 
(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, no Participant shall be permitted to withdraw any portion of his Account pledged
as security for a loan pursuant to ARTICLE IX.  8.05 Beneficiary Designation Right. 
(a) Spouse as Beneficiary. The Beneficiary of a death benefit payable pursuant to Section 8.01 shall be the Participants
Spouse as of the Participants date of death; provided, however, that the Participant may designate a Beneficiary other than his Spouse pursuant to subsection (b) if: 
(1) the requirements of subsection (c) are satisfied, or 
(2) the Participant has no Spouse, or 
(3) the Committee determines that the Spouse cannot be located or such other circumstances exist under which Spousal consent is not required,
as prescribed by Treasury Regulations.  (b) Beneficiary Designation Right. Each Participant who is permitted to designate a
Beneficiary other than his Spouse pursuant to subsection (a) shall have the right to designate one or more primary and one or more contingent Beneficiaries to receive any benefit becoming payable upon the Participants death. All
Beneficiary designations shall be in writing in a form satisfactory to the Committee. Each Participant shall be entitled to change his Beneficiaries at any time and from time to time by filing a written notice of such change with the Committee.
However, the Participants Spouse must again consent in writing to such change, unless (1) the change is a revocation of the prior consent or (2) one of the exceptions described in subsection (a)(2)or (a)(3) applies. 
   39 





 In the event that the Participant fails to designate a Beneficiary to receive a benefit that
becomes payable pursuant to Section 8.01, or in the event that the Participant is predeceased by all designated primary and contingent Beneficiaries, the death benefit shall be payable to the Participants estate. 
After a Participants death, any Beneficiary of the deceased Participant may designate one or more secondary beneficiaries to receive the
Beneficiarys interest in the Plan attributable to the Participants benefits after the Beneficiarys death, to the extent such designation is not inconsistent with the Participants beneficiary designation. If the Beneficiary
fails to designate a beneficiary or if none of his designated beneficiaries survive him, the death benefit shall be payable to the Beneficiarys estate. 
(c) Form and Content of Spouses Consent. A Spouse may consent to the designation of one or more Beneficiaries other than such
Spouse; provided, that such consent shall be in writing, must consent to the specific alternate beneficiary or beneficiaries designated, must acknowledge the effect of such consent, and must be witnessed by a Plan representative or notary public.
Such Spouses consent shall be irrevocable, unless expressly made revocable. The consent of a Spouse in accordance with this subsection (c) shall not be effective with respect to any subsequent Spouse of the Participant. 
8.06 Domestic Relations Orders. 
(a) General. Except as otherwise provided in this Section, an Alternate Payee shall have no rights to a Participants benefit and
shall have no rights under this Plan other than those rights specifically granted to the Alternate Payee pursuant to a QDRO. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Alternate Payee shall have the right to make a claim for any benefits awarded to the
Alternate Payee pursuant to a QDRO, as provided in ARTICLE XIII. Any interest of an Alternate Payee in the Account of a Participant, other than an interest payable solely upon the Participants death pursuant to a QDRO which provides that the
Alternate Payee shall be treated as the Participants surviving spouse, shall be separately accounted for by the Trustee in the name and for the benefit of the Alternate Payee. 
(1) Distribution. Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, a QDRO may provide that any benefits of a Participant payable
to an Alternate Payee that are separately accounted for shall be distributed immediately or at any other time specified in the order. If the order does not specify the time at which benefits shall be payable to the Alternate Payee, the Alternate
Payee may elect to have benefits commence at any time after the order is determined to be qualified.  (b) Withdrawals. Unless a QDRO
establishing a separate account for an Alternate Payee provides to the contrary, an Alternate Payee for whom a separate account is established shall not be permitted to make any withdrawals under ARTICLE VIII. 
(c) Death Benefits. Unless a QDRO establishing a separate account for an Alternate Payee provides to the contrary, an Alternate Payee
for whom a separate account is established shall have the right to designate a Beneficiary, in the same manner as provided in Section 8.05 with respect to a Participant (except that no Spousal consent shall be required), who

   40 





 
shall receive benefits payable to an Alternate Payee which have not been distributed at the time of an Alternate Payees death. Upon an Alternate Payees death, a separate account shall
be established for any such Beneficiary. If the Alternate Payee for whom a separate account is established does not designate a Beneficiary, or if the Beneficiary predeceases the Alternate Payee, benefits payable to the Alternate Payee that have not
been distributed shall be paid to the Alternate Payees estate.  (d) Investment Direction. Unless a QDRO establishing a
separate account for an Alternate Payee provides to the contrary, an Alternate Payee for whom a separate account is established shall have the right to direct the investment of any portion of a Participants Accounts payable to the Alternate
Payee under such order in the same manner as provided in ARTICLE VI with respect to a Participant, which amounts shall be separately accounted for by the Trustee in the Alternate Payees name. 
(e) Loans. An Alternate Payee shall not be permitted to receive a loan under ARTICLE IX. 
8.07 Post Distribution Credits. In the event that, after the payment of a single-sum distribution under this Plan (other than an
in-service benefit distribution described in Section 8.04), any funds shall be subsequently credited to the Participants Account, such additional funds shall be paid to the Participant or applied for the Participants Account as
promptly as practicable thereafter.  8.08 Direct Rollovers. In the event any payment or payments to be made under the Plan to a
Participant, a Beneficiary, or an Alternate Payee would constitute an eligible rollover distribution, such individual may request that such payment or payments be transferred directly from the Trust to the trustee of an eligible
rollover plan. Any such request shall be made in the form prescribed by the Committee for such purpose, at such time in advance as the Committee may specify. 
For purposes of this Section, 
(a) eligible rollover distribution shall mean a distribution from the Plan, excluding (1) any distribution that is one
of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) over the life (or life expectancy) of the individual, the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the individual and the individuals designated
Beneficiary, or a specified period of 10 or more years, (2) any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Code section 401(a)(9), and (3) any hardship distribution; and 
(b) eligible rollover plan shall mean (1) an individual retirement account described in Code section 408(a),
(2) an individual retirement annuity described in Code section 408(b) (other than an endowment contract), (3) an annuity plan described in Code section 403(a), (4) a qualified plan, the terms of which permit the acceptance of rollover
distributions, (5) an eligible deferred compensation plan described in Code section 457(b) that is maintained by an eligible employer described in Code section 457(e)(i)(A) that shall separately account for the distribution, or (6) an
annuity contract described in Code section 403(b); provided, however, that, effective January 1, 2007, with respect to a distribution (or portion of a distribution) 
   41 





 
consisting of after-tax employee contributions, the term eligible rollover plan shall mean a plan described in clauses (4) and (6) that separately accounts for such amounts
transferred and earnings on such amounts or a plan described in clause (1) or (2). Effective January 1, 2008, an eligible rollover plan shall also mean an individual retirement account described in Code section 408A; provided,
that the distribution to the individual retirement account described in Code section 408A constitutes a qualified rollover contribution under Code section 408A(e). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any portion of an eligible rollover
distribution is attributable to payments or distributions from a Participants Roth 401(k) Account, an eligible rollover plan with respect to such portion shall include only another designated Roth 401(k) account described in Code section 402A
or a Roth individual retirement account described in Code section 408A, and only to the extent the rollover is permitted under the rules of Code section 402(c). Effective January 1, 2007, in the case of a distribution to a non-spouse
Beneficiary who is a designated Beneficiary within the meaning of Code section 401(a)(9)(E), an eligible rollover plan is an individual retirement account established on behalf of the designated Beneficiary that will be treated as an
inherited individual retirement account pursuant to the provisions of Code section 402(c)(11).  8.09 Waiver of 2009 Required
Distributions. Notwithstanding anything in this ARTICLE VIII to the contrary, a Participant or Beneficiary who would have been required to receive required minimum distributions for 2009 but for enactment of Code section 401(a)(9)(H)
(2009 RMDs), and who would have satisfied that requirement by receiving distributions that are (i) equal to the 2009 RMDs, or (ii) one or more payments in a series of substantially equal distributions that include the
2009 RMDs) made at least annually and expected to last for the life (or life expectancy) of the Participant, the joint lives (or joint life expectancy) of the Participant and the Participants designated Beneficiary, or for a period of at least
10 years, will not receive those distributions for 2009 unless the Participant or Beneficiary chooses to receive such distributions. Participants and Beneficiaries described in the preceding sentence will be given the opportunity to elect to receive
the distributions described in the preceding sentence. A direct rollover will be offered only for distributions that would be eligible rollover distributions (as defined in Section 8.08) without regard to Code section 401(a)(9)(H). 
   42 





 ARTICLE IX 
PARTICIPANT LOANS  9.01
Loans in General.  (a) Permissibility. Each Participant or Beneficiary who satisfies such uniform and nondiscriminatory
conditions as may from time to time be adopted by the Committee may apply for a loan from the Plan.  (b) Application. Subject to
such uniform and nondiscriminatory rules as may from time to time be adopted by the Committee, the Trustee, upon application by such Eligible Borrower in such manner as may be approved by the Committee, may make a loan or loans to such applicant.
 (c) Limitation on Amount. 
(1) Loans shall be at least $1,000 in amount, and in no event shall total loans exceed the lesser of (A) 50% of the vested balance of
such Eligible Borrowers Accounts, or (B) $50,000, reduced by the excess, if any, of (i) the highest outstanding balance of all loans during the 12 months prior to the time the new loan is to be made over (ii) the outstanding
balance of loans made to the Eligible Borrower prior to the date such new loan is made. Loans under any other qualified plan sponsored by the Employer or any Affiliated Company shall be aggregated with loans under the Plan in determining whether or
not the limitation stated herein has been exceeded.  (2) Pending the final determination by the Plan Administrator of whether a domestic
relations order is a QDRO, no loan to any Eligible Borrower may exceed an amount greater than the maximum permissible loan amount that would be available assuming that the benefit described in the domestic relations order had already been
distributed to the alternate payee under a QDRO; provided, however, that the Committee may, in its sole discretion, adopt a policy that universally prohibits loans to an otherwise Eligible Borrower pending the final determination of a whether a
domestic relations order is a QDRO.  (d) Equality of Borrowing Opportunity. Loans shall be available to all Eligible Borrowers who
are parties in interest on a reasonably equivalent and nondiscriminatory basis. Loans shall not be made available to Eligible Borrowers who are or were Highly Compensated Employees in an amount greater than the amount available to other Eligible
Borrowers.  (e) Loan Statement. Every Eligible Borrower receiving a loan hereunder will receive a statement from the Committee
clearly reflecting the charges involved in each transaction, including the dollar amount and annual interest rate of the finance charges. The statement will provide all information required to meet applicable truth-in-lending laws. 
(f) Restriction on Loans. The Committee will not approve any loan if it is the belief of the Committee that such loan, if made, would
constitute a prohibited transaction (within the meaning of section 406 of ERISA or Code section 4975(c)), would constitute a distribution 
   43 





 
taxable for federal income tax purposes, or would imperil the status of the Plan or any part thereof under Code section 401(k). An Eligible Borrower may have no more than two loans outstanding at
any time, which may include no more than one loan that is for the purchase of a primary residence.  9.02 Loans as Trust Fund
Investments. All loans shall be considered as fixed income investments of a segregated account of the Trust Fund (a loan fund) directed by the borrower. Accordingly, the following conditions shall apply with respect to each
such loan:  (a) Security. All loans shall be secured by the pledge of such portion of the Eligible Borrowers Account as is
sufficient to secure repayment of the loan.  (b) Interest Rate. The interest rate on any loan shall be commensurate with the
prevailing interest rate charged on similar commercial loans under like circumstances by persons in the business of lending money and shall be determined by the Committee. 
(c) Loan Term. Loans shall be for terms of up to five years or, with respect to a loan used to acquire a dwelling unit which will be
used as the principal residence of the Eligible Borrower, 15 years; provided, however, that if the Eligible Borrower is absent from work for the performance of military service in any branch of the uniformed services (as defined in chapter 43 of
title 38, United States Code), any payments may be suspended during such period of military service and, if suspended, shall resume following the completion of the period of such military service. Any such resumed payments shall be made, following
the period of such military service, at least as frequently as, and in an amount not less than, the original loan payments. In the event of such military service, the term of the loan may be extended by a period not to exceed the original term of
the loan plus the period of such military service. With respect to loans that are outstanding when an Eligible Borrower begins a period of such military service, the interest rate on any such loans shall be limited to 6% to the extent required to
comply with section 207 of the Service members Civil Relief Act (or any successor statute thereto); provided, that the Committee may require that the Eligible Borrower has provided the Committee with written notice and a copy of the military orders
calling the Eligible Employee to military service and any orders further extending military service no later than 180 days after the date of the Eligible Employees termination or release from military service. Any loan fees charged to the
Accounts of the Eligible Borrower during the period of military service shall be included as interest for purposes of calculating the maximum 6% interest rate. 
(d) Promissory Note. Any loan made to an Eligible Borrower under this Article shall be evidenced by the promissory note returned to the
Eligible Borrower after the loan has been processed. Such promissory note shall contain the irrevocable consent of the Eligible Borrower to the payroll withholding described in subsection (f), if applicable. The Committee shall have the right to
require the Eligible Borrower to submit revised materials to the extent the Committee determines it is necessary to comply with ERISA or the Code. 
(e) Refinancing of Loans. Eligible Borrower may not refinance an existing loan. 
   44 





 (f) Default and Remedies. In the event that: 
(1) an Eligible Borrower (other than an Eligible Borrower who continues to be a party in interest) has a Severance from Service and fails to
make adequate arrangements, as determined by the Committee, in its sole discretion, to continue to make installment payments and does not repay the full unpaid balance of the loan plus applicable interest within such time as may be designated by the
Committee; or  (2) in the case of a deceased Eligible Borrower, the Beneficiary fails to repay the full unpaid balance of the loan plus
applicable interest within such time as may be designated by the Committee; or  (3) the Eligible Borrower fails to pay any installment by
the end of the calendar quarter following the calendar quarter in which the installment pay became delinquent as provided in Section 9.02(g)(2); or 
(4) the Eligible Borrower (A) makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, (B) files a petition for bankruptcy, (C) is
adjudicated insolvent or bankrupt, or (D) becomes the subject of any wage earner plan under the federal Bankruptcy Code as now or hereafter in effect, or under any applicable state insolvency law; or 
(5) there is started against the Eligible Borrower any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceeding which has not been dismissed by the
60th day after the date on which the proceeding was started, or the Eligible Borrower consents to or approves of any such proceeding or the appointment of any receiver for the Eligible Borrower or any substantial part of the Eligible Borrowers
property, or the appointment of any such receiver is not discharged within 60 days;  the unpaid balance of the loan, with interest due thereon, shall
become immediately due and payable. In the event that a loan becomes immediately due and payable (in default), the Eligible Borrower (or his Beneficiary in the event of his death) may satisfy the loan by paying the outstanding
balance in full within 60 days of receiving written notice from the Committee of such default; provided, however, that any such satisfaction of a loan in default must be made no later than the last day of the grace period, if any, designated by the
Committee (which grace period shall not extend beyond the last day of the calendar quarter following the calendar quarter in which the required installment was due). Otherwise, any such outstanding loan or loans (plus unpaid interest) shall be
deducted from any benefit which is or becomes payable to the Eligible Borrower or his Beneficiary from the amount and the portions of his Account pledged as security for the loan as soon as is practicable after such default; provided, however, that
if the Eligible Borrower has not died or incurred a Severance from Service, the Eligible Borrowers Salary Deferral Account and Roth 401(k) Contributions Account shall only be used to reduce the Eligible Borrowers indebtedness at such
time as the Eligible Borrower is entitled to a distribution under Section 8.02 or a withdrawal under Section 8.04 from his Salary Deferral Account and Roth 401(k) Contributions Account. Such action shall not operate as a waiver of the
rights of the Employer, the Committee, the Trustee or the Plan under applicable law. 
   45 





 (g) Repayment. 
(1) Loans shall be amortized and repaid in equal installments (not less frequently than quarterly) through payroll withholding; provided,
however, that the Committee, in its sole discretion, may authorize an Eligible Borrower who has incurred a Severance from Service or a disability or transferred to an Affiliated Company, or who is otherwise not actively employed by an Employer, to
repay his loan by making direct installment payments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of an Eligible Borrowers unpaid leave of absence, the Committee may suspend the Eligible Borrowers installment payment for up to 12 months;
provided, however, (i) the loan must still be repaid by the end of the term of the loan, which may be extended by the Committee, in its sole discretion, as provided herein, and (ii) the remaining balance of the loan must be reamortized
upon the Eligible Borrowers recommencing active employment. In the event that repayment of a loan is suspended as provided in this subsection (g), the term of such loan may be extended provided that such extension shall in no event be longer
than the maximum period allowable for such loan at the time it was made as provided in subsection (c) above.  (2) An installment
payment shall be delinquent if the Eligible Borrower fails to pay the installment payment within 30 days of the date the installment payment is due. 
(3) Loans may be prepaid in full at any time without penalty. Partial prepayment is not permitted. 
(4) No distribution of an Eligible Borrowers Accounts shall be made to the Eligible Borrower or the Eligible Borrowers Beneficiary
or estate until all loans, together with accrued interest, have been paid in full.  (h) Loan Fees. Fees properly chargeable in
connection with a loan may be charged, in accordance with a uniform and nondiscriminatory policy established by the Committee, against the Account of the Eligible Borrower to whom the loan is granted. 
(i) Applicable Accounts and Investment Funds. 
(1) At such time as it is determined that an Eligible Borrower is to receive a loan from the Plan, the loan shall be made from the Eligible
Borrowers applicable Account in the order and precedence indicated hereafter and such amount shall be deemed to be credited to a separate Account established for such purposes (the Loan Account), with a corresponding debit
to occur to his Account as of the first day of the month in which such loan occurs: (i) first, an Account holding Roth Rollover Contributions, if applicable; (ii) second, an Account holding Rollover Contributions that are not Roth Rollover
Contributions, if applicable, (iii) third, an Account holding after-tax contributions, if applicable, (iv) fourth, an Account holding Roth 401(k) Contributions, if applicable; and (iv) third, an Account holding Salary Deferrals, if
applicable. Loans shall not be permitted from any amounts attributable to Matching Contributions, Company Retirement Contributions or other Employer contributions. All loans shall be funded from the Investment Funds in which the Eligible
Borrowers Account that is being debited is invested on a pro-rata basis. 
   46 





 (2) All interest payments to be made pursuant to the terms and provisions of the loan shall be
credited to the applicable Account in such a manner so that the Loan Account will reflect unpaid principal and interest from time to time. The earnings attributable to the Loan Account shall be allocable only to the Loan Account of such Eligible
Borrower and shall not considered as general earnings of the Trust Fund to be allocated to other Eligible Borrowers. Other than for the limited purposes of establishing a separate account for the allocation of the interest thereto, a Eligible
Borrowers Loan Account shall, for all other purposes, be considered as a part of the applicable Account.  (3) Loan repayments to the
Plan by the Eligible Borrower shall be invested in the Investment Funds on the basis of the Eligible Borrowers current investment election under Section 6.03, or the Eligible Borrowers most recent investment election, if no
investment election is currently in effect, unless the Eligible Borrower elects otherwise in accordance with rules prescribed by the Committee.

investment alternatives selected by the Investment Committee, except to the extent delegated to other persons or otherwise provided for herein. With respect to said authority and responsibility, the Asset Allocation Fiduciary shall be a Named
Fiduciary and, as such, shall have no authority and responsibility other than as granted in the Plan or as imposed by law. If the Investment Committee does not appoint an Asset Allocation Fiduciary, the Investment Committee shall have the
authority and responsibilities set forth in this section.  11.06 Limitations on Obligations of Named Fiduciaries. No Named Fiduciary
shall have authority or responsibility to deal with matters other than as delegated to it under this Plan, under the Trust Agreement, or by operation of law. Except as provided by section 405 of ERISA, a Named Fiduciary shall not in any event be
liable for breach of fiduciary responsibility or obligation by another fiduciary (including other Named Fiduciaries) if the responsibility or authority of the act or omission deemed to be a breach was not within the scope of the said Named
Fiduciarys authority or delegated responsibility. The determination of any Named Fiduciary as to any matter involving its responsibilities hereunder shall be conclusive and binding on all persons. 
11.07 Designation and Delegation. Each Named Fiduciary may designate other persons to carry out such of its responsibilities hereunder
for the operation and administration of the Plan as it deems advisable and delegate to the persons so designated such of its powers as it deems necessary to carry out such responsibilities. Such designation and delegation shall be subject to such
terms and conditions as the Named Fiduciary deems necessary or proper. Any action or determination made or taken in carrying out responsibilities hereunder by the persons so designated by the Named Fiduciary shall have the same force and effect for
all purposes as if such action or determination had been made or taken by such Named Fiduciary.  11.08 Engagement of Assistants and
Advisers. Any Named Fiduciary shall have the right to hire, at the expense of the Trust Fund, such professional assistants, counsel and consultants as it, in its sole discretion, deems necessary or advisable. 
11.09 Payment of Expenses. The reasonable expenses incurred by the Named Fiduciaries in connection with the operation of the Plan,
including but not limited to, the expenses incurred by reason of the engagement of professional assistants, counsel and consultants, shall be expenses of the Plan and shall be payable from the Trust Fund at the direction of the Committee. The
Employer shall have the option, but not the obligation, to pay any such expenses, in whole or in part, and by so doing, to relieve the Trust Fund from the obligation of bearing such expenses. Payment of any such expenses by any Employer on any
occasion shall not bind the Employer to thereafter pay any similar expenses.  11.10 Indemnification. Each person who is a Named
Fiduciary or a member of any committee or board comprising a Named Fiduciary (other than the Trustee), and each employee of the Employer who is a delegee of a Named Fiduciary, may be indemnified by the Employer against costs, expenses and
liabilities (other than amounts paid in settlement to which the Employer does not consent) reasonably incurred by him in connection with any action to which he may be a party by reason of his service as a Named Fiduciary to the extent permitted
under 
   52 





 
applicable law. The foregoing right to indemnification shall be in addition to such other rights as the person may enjoy as a matter of law or by reason of insurance coverage of any kind, but
shall not extend to costs, expenses and/or liabilities otherwise covered by insurance or that would be so covered by any insurance then in force if such insurance contained a waiver of subrogation. Rights granted hereunder shall be in addition to
and not in lieu of any rights to indemnification to which the person may be entitled pursuant to the bylaws of the Company. Service as a Named Fiduciary shall be deemed in partial fulfillment of the persons function as an employee, officer
and/or director of the Company, if he serves in that capacity as well as in the role of Named Fiduciary.  11.11 Bonding. The
Committee shall arrange for such bonding as is required by law for persons who are Employees and/or members of the Board of Directors, but no bonding in excess of the amount required by law shall be considered required by the Plan. The Company shall
obtain, and pay the expense of, any bond required by law.

 ARTICLE XIII 
APPLICATION FOR BENEFITS AND CLAIMS PROCEDURES 
13.01 Application for Benefits. Each Participant, Beneficiary or Alternate Payee believing himself or herself eligible for benefits
under the Plan shall apply for such benefits by applying to the Committee (or a person named by the Committee to receive claims under the Plan) in the form and manner specified by the Committee. Before the date on which benefit payments commence,
each such application must be supported by such information and data as the Committee deems relevant and appropriate. Evidence of age, marital status (and, in the appropriate instances, death), and location of residence shall be required of all
applicants for benefits. In the event a Participant, Beneficiary or Alternate Payee fails to apply to the Committee prior to the applicable required distribution date described in Sections 8.01(c) or 8.02(b)(3), the Committee shall make diligent
efforts to locate such Participant, Beneficiary or Alternate Payee and obtain such application. In the event the Participant, Beneficiary, or Alternate Payee fails to make application by the applicable date described in Section 8.01(c) or
8.02(b)(3), the Committee shall commence distribution as of such date without such application. However, if the Committee fails to locate the Participant, Beneficiary or Alternate Payee so that distribution as of the applicable date described in
Section 8.01(c) or 8.02(b)(3) is not possible, the Participant, Beneficiary or Alternate Payee shall be considered a lost payee as described in Section 16.13; provided, however, that, in the event that the Participant, Beneficiary or
Alternate Payee is located, payment shall be made as soon as administratively practicable after the date on which the Participant, Beneficiary or Alternate Payee is located. 
13.02 Claims Procedure. 
(a) Establishment of Claims Procedures. The Committee shall establish claims and appeals procedures in accordance with this
Section 13.02 and applicable law and shall afford a reasonable opportunity to any Participant whose claim for benefits has been denied for a full and fair review of the decision denying such claim. 
(b) Appeals of Denied Claims for Benefits. In the event that any claim for benefits is denied in whole or in part, the Participant,
Beneficiary or Alternate Payee whose claim has been so denied shall be notified of such denial in writing or electronically by the Committee (or a person named by the Committee to receive claims under the Plan). For purposes of this Section, the
person or persons designated to determine initial claims shall be referred to as the Claims Fiduciary and the person or persons designated to determine appeals shall be referred to as the Named Appeals Fiduciary, and any
references to the Claims Fiduciary or Named Appeals Fiduciary in this Section 13.02 shall mean the Committee (and references to the Committee shall also mean the Claims Fiduciary or Named Appeals Fiduciary) as the context so provides. The
Claims Fiduciary will review such request and respond within a reasonable time after receiving the claim. The notice advising of the denial shall be furnished to the Participant, Beneficiary or Alternate Payee within 90 days of receipt of the
benefit claim by the Committee, unless special circumstances require an extension of time to process the claim. If an extension is required, the Claims Fiduciary shall provide notice of the extension prior to the termination of the applicable
period. In no event may the extension exceed a total of 180 days from the date of the original receipt of the claim. The notice advising of the denial shall specify 
   58 





 
the reason or reasons for denial, make specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions, describe any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim (explaining
why such material or information is needed), and shall advise the Participant, Beneficiary or Alternate Payee, as the case may be, of the procedure for the appeal of such denial and the time limits applicable to such procedures, including a
statement of the claimants right to bring a civil action under section 502(a) of ERISA following an adverse benefit determination on review. All appeals shall be made by the following procedure: 
(1) The Participant, Beneficiary or Alternate Payee whose claim has been denied shall file with the Claims Fiduciary a notice of desire to
appeal the denial. Such notice shall be filed within 60 days of notification by Claims Fiduciary, as the case may be, of claim denial, shall be made in writing, and shall set forth all of the facts upon which the appeal is based. In connection with
any such appeal, the Participant, Beneficiary or Alternative Payee shall be provided, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records and other information relevant to the claim for benefits. Appeals not
timely filed shall be barred.  (2) The Named Appeals Fiduciary shall consider the merits of the claimants written presentations, the
merits of any facts or evidence in support of the denial of benefits, and such other facts and circumstances as the Named Appeals Fiduciary shall deem relevant, without regard to whether such information was submitted or considered in the initial
determination.  (3) The Named Appeals Fiduciary shall ordinarily render a determination upon the appealed claim within 60 days after its
receipt which determination shall be accompanied by a written or electronic statement setting forth (i) the reasons therefor; (ii) specific references to the pertinent Plan provisions on which the decisions is based; (iii) a
description of the claimants right to, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records and other information relevant to the claim for benefits; (iv) a description of any voluntary appeal
procedures offered by the Plan; and (v) a statement of the claimants right to bring a civil action under section 502(a) of ERISA. However, in special circumstances the Named Appeals Fiduciary may extend the response period for up to an
additional 60 days, in which event it shall notify the claimant in writing prior to commencement of the extension. Any determination rendered by the Named Appeals Fiduciary shall be final and binding upon all parties. 
(4) If the Claimant challenges the decision of the Named Appeals Fiduciary, a review by a court shall be permitted only in accordance with
subsection (d) below, Failure to comply with the time limits set forth above will bar the claimant from filing suit in court. Any review by a court shall be limited to the facts, evidence and issues presented during the claims procedure set
forth above. Facts and evidence that become known to the claimant after having exhausted the review process may be submitted for reconsideration of the review in accordance with the time limits established in above. Issues not raised during the
review process shall be deemed waived. 
   59 





 (c) Authority to Determine Claims. The Committee has exclusive authority to decide all
claims under the Plan. The Committee has exclusive authority to review and resolve any appeal of a denied claim. The Committee is a Plan fiduciary with full discretionary authority to do the following: to make findings of fact; to interpret the Plan
and resolve ambiguities therein; to determine whether a claimant is eligible for benefits; to decide the amount, form and timing of benefits; and to resolve any other matter which is raised by a claimant or identified by the Committee. In the case
of an appeal, the decision of the Committee shall be final and binding upon all parties.  (d) Exhaustion of Claims Procedures. A
claim or action (1) to recover benefits allegedly due under the provisions of the Plan or by reason of any law, (2) to enforce rights under the Plan, (3) to clarify rights to future benefits under the Plan, or (4) any other claim
or action that relates to the Plan and seeks a remedy, ruling, or judgment of any kind against the Plan or a Plan fiduciary or party in interest may not be filed in any court until the claimant has exhausted the Plans claim and appeal process
for any and all reasons the claimant believes his claim should be approved. In addition, any such claim or action must be filed no later than 36 months after, as appropriate, the date the first benefit payment was made or due, the date the Committee
or its delegate first denied the claimants request, or the earliest date the claimant knew or should have known the material facts on which such claim or action is based. Any claim or action filed after the end of this 36-month period shall be
time-barred.  (e) Reliance on Records. The records of the Employer and any Affiliated Company with respect to length of employment,
employment history, compensation, absences from employment and all other relevant matters may be conclusively relied on by the Committee for purposes of determining an individuals eligibility or entitlement to Plan benefits, the amount of Plan
benefits payable to an individual, the appropriate timing of payment of Plan benefits to an individual, and so forth. If an individual claiming benefits under the Plan believes those records are incorrect, the individual may provide documentation
supporting his or her position to the Committee for review and consideration. However, the decision of the Committee with respect to any records dispute shall be final and binding on all parties. 
   60 





 ARTICLE XIV 
AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION 
14.01 Amendment. The provisions of the Plan may be amended at any time and from time to time by the Company; provided, however, that:
 (a) No amendment shall increase the duties or liabilities of the Committee or of the Trustee without the consent of that party; 
(b) No amendment shall deprive any Participant, Beneficiary or Alternate Payee of any of the benefits to which he is entitled under the Plan

unless otherwise permitted or required by law;  (c) No amendment shall provide for the use of funds or assets held to provide benefits
under the Plan other than for the benefit of Participants and their Beneficiaries or Alternate Payees or to meet the administrative expenses of the Plan, except as may be specifically authorized by statute or regulation.

however, that the Committee (or its duly authorized delegate) may make (1) any technical, administrative or compliance amendment to the Plan and (2) any amendment to the Plan that will not result in a material increase in cost of the Plan
to the Company, as the Committee (or its duly authorized delegate) shall deem necessary or appropriate in its sole discretion, including any amendment and restatement of the Plan to include such amendments. 
14.02 Amendments to the Vesting Schedule. 
(a) If the vesting schedule under this Plan is amended, each active Participant who has completed at least three Years of Service prior to the

(b) Any termination of the Plan shall become effective as of the date designated by the Board of Directors. Except as expressly provided

the benefit of Participants and their Beneficiaries or Alternate Payees or to meet the administrative expenses of the Plan. Upon termination or partial termination of the Plan, or upon complete discontinuance of contributions, the rights of all

or transferee plan if such plan were then terminated immediately after such merger, consolidation or transfer that is equal to or greater than the benefit he would have had immediately before such merger, consolidation or transfer in the plan in
which he was then a participant had such plan been terminated at that time and no such merger, consolidation or transfer shall result in the elimination or reduction of a benefit protected under Code section 411(d)(6), unless otherwise
permitted or required by applicable law. For the purposes hereof, former Participants, Beneficiaries and Alternate Payees shall be considered Participants.

(a) Except as provided in Section 15.01(b), none of the payments, benefits or rights of any Participant, Alternate Payee or Beneficiary
shall be subject to any claim of any creditor, and, in particular, to the fullest extent permitted by law, all such payments, benefits and rights shall be free from attachment, garnishment, trustees process, or any other legal or equitable
process available to any creditor of such Participant, Alternate Payee or Beneficiary. Except as provided in Section 15.01(b), no Participant, Alternate Payee or Beneficiary shall have the right to alienate, anticipate, commute, pledge,
encumber or assign any of the benefits or payments which he may expect to receive, contingently or otherwise, under the Plan, except the right to designate a Beneficiary or Beneficiaries as hereinabove provided. 
(b) Compliance with the provisions and conditions of (1) any QDRO, (2) any federal tax levy made pursuant to Code section 6331, or

Labor or the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation relating to a violation (or an alleged violation) of part 4 of subtitle B of title I of ERISA shall not be considered a violation of this provision. 
16.02 No Contract of Employment. Neither the establishment of the Plan, nor any modification thereof, nor the creation of any fund,
trust or account, nor the payment of any benefits shall be construed as giving any Participant or Employee, or any person whomsoever, the right to be retained in the service of the Employer, and all Participants and other Employees shall remain
subject to discharge to the same extent as if the Plan had never been adopted.  16.03 Severability of Provisions. If any provision
of the Plan shall be held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions hereof, and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if such provisions had not been included. 
16.04 Heirs, Assigns and Personal Representatives. This Plan shall be binding upon the heirs, executors, administrators, successors and
assigns of the parties, including each Participant, Beneficiary and Alternate Payee, present and future (except that no successor to the Employer shall be considered a Plan sponsor unless that successor adopts the Plan). 
16.05 Headings and Captions. The headings and captions herein are provided for reference and convenience only, shall not be considered
part of the Plan, and shall not be employed in the construction of the Plan.  16.06 Gender and Number. Except where otherwise
clearly indicated by context, the masculine and the neuter shall include the feminine and the neuter, the singular shall include the plural, and vice-versa. 
   66 





 16.07 Controlling Law. This Plan shall be construed and enforced according to the laws of
the State of Oklahoma to the extent not preempted by federal law, which shall otherwise control. All contributions to the Trust Fund shall be deemed to take place in the State of Oklahoma. 
16.08 Funding Policy. The Investment Committee appointed under Section 12.03 (or the Committee, if no Investment Committee has been
appointed) shall establish, and communicate to the Trustee, a funding policy and method consistent with the objectives of the Plan and of the Trust Fund. 
16.09 Title to Assets; Source of Benefits. No person shall have any right to, or interest in, any assets of the Trust Fund, except as
provided from time to time under the Plan, and then only to the extent of the benefits payable under the Plan to such person or out of the assets of the Trust Fund. All payments of benefits as provided for in the Plan shall be made from the assets
of the Trust Fund, and neither the Employer nor any other person shall be liable therefore in any manner.  16.10 Payments to Minors,
Etc. Any benefit payable to or for the benefit of a minor, an incompetent person or other person incapable of receipting therefore shall be deemed paid when paid to such persons guardian or to the party providing or reasonably appearing to
provide for the care of such person, and such payment (which may be in installments) shall fully discharge the Trustee, the Committee, the Employer and all other parties with respect thereto. 
16.11 Reliance on Data and Consents. The Employer, the Trustee, the Committee, all fiduciaries with respect to the Plan, and all other
persons or entities associated with the operation of the Plan, the management of its assets, and the provision of benefits thereunder, may reasonably rely on the truth, accuracy and completeness of all data provided by any Participant, Beneficiary
or Alternate Payee, including, without limitation, data with respect to age, health and marital status. Furthermore, the Employer, the Trustee, the Committee and all fiduciaries with respect to the Plan may reasonably rely on all consents, elections
and designations filed with the Plan or those associated with the operation of the Plan and its corresponding trust by any Participant, the spouse of any Participant, any Beneficiary of any Participant, any Alternate Payee of any Participant or the
representatives of such persons without duty to inquire into the genuineness of any such consent, election or designation. None of the aforementioned persons or entities associated with the operation of the Plan, its assets and the benefits provided
under the Plan shall have any duty to inquire into any such data, and all may rely on such data being current to the date of reference, it being the duty of the Participants, spouses of Participants, Beneficiaries and Alternate Payees to advise the
appropriate parties of any change in such data.  16.12 Deemed Acceptance of Act or Omission by a Plan Fiduciary. If a Plan fiduciary
(as determined under ERISA) or an individual or entity with authority delegated by a Plan fiduciary, acts or fails to act with respect to a Participant or a Participants Account under the Plan and the Participant has direct or indirect
knowledge of such act or failure to act, the Participants failure to notify the Plan fiduciary (or the Plan fiduciarys delegate) within a reasonable period of time that such act or failure to act was incorrect or inconsistent with the
Participants intent or election shall be deemed to be an acceptance and ratification of the Plan fiduciarys (or the Plan fiduciarys delegate) act or failure to act. 
   67 





 16.13 Lost Payees. A benefit shall be deemed forfeited, and first used to pay Plan
expenses, then used to reduce future Matching Contributions or future Discretionary Contributions by the Employer that last employed the Participant, if the Committee is unable to locate a Participant, a Beneficiary or an Alternate Payee to whom
payment is due; provided, however, that such benefit shall be reinstated, without any earnings from the date deemed forfeited to the date reinstated, if a claim is made by the party to whom properly payable. 
16.14 No Warranties. Neither the Board of Directors nor its members nor the Committee nor the Company nor any Employer nor any
Affiliated Company nor the Trustee warrants or represents in any way that the value of each Participants Accounts will increase or will not decrease. The Participant assumes all risk in connection with any change in values. 
16.15 Multiple Employer Plan Provisions. Notwithstanding any other provision in the Plan to the contrary, unless the Plan is a
collectively bargained multiemployer plan described in Treas. Reg. § 1.413-1(a), the following provisions will apply with respect to any Participating Employer: 
(a) Employees of a Participating Employer will be treated separately for purposes of testing under the provisions of Code sections 401(a)(4),
401(a)(26), 401(k), 401(m), and, if the Company and the Participating Employer do not share Employees, Code section 416. Furthermore, the terms of Code section 410(b) will be applied separately on an employer-by-employer basis by the Company (and
Employers that are Affiliated Companies of the Company) and each Participating Employer, taking into account the generally applicable rules described in Code section 401(a)(5), 414(b) and 414(c). 
(b) Employees of the Participating Employer will be treated as part of a single employer plan for purposes of eligibility to participate under
ARTICLE III and under the provisions of Code section 410(a). Furthermore, the terms of Code section 411 relating to vesting under the Plan as described in ARTICLE VII will be applied as if all Employees of all Employers were employed by a single
employer, except that the rules regarding Periods of Severance will be applied under such regulations as may be prescribed by the Secretary of Labor. 
(c) Contributions made by any such Participating Employer will be held in a common Trust Fund with contributions made by other Employers, and
all such contributions will be available to pay the benefits of any Participant, Beneficiary or Alternate Payee.  (d) The failure of either
the Company or any such Participating Employer to satisfy the qualification requirements under the provisions of Code section 401(a), as modified by the provisions of Code section 413(c), will result in the disqualification of the Plan for all such
Employers maintaining the Plan.  (e) A Participating Employer may terminate participation in the Plan by delivering written notice to the
Company, the Committee and the Trustee; but in accordance with Section 14.03, only the Company can terminate the Plan. Such Participating Employer may thereupon request a transfer of Trust Fund assets attributable to its Employees from this
Plan to any successor qualified retirement plan maintained by the Participating Employer or its successor. The Committee may, however, refuse to make such transfer if it determines, in its 
   68 





 
sole discretion, that such transfer would operate to the detriment of any Participant, jeopardize the continued qualification of the Plan, or does not comply with any requirements of the Internal
Revenue Service. If a request for, and approval of, a transfer of assets from this Plan to any successor qualified retirement plan maintained by the Participating Employer or its successor is not made or approved, Participants who are no longer
Employees because the Participating Employer terminates its Plan participation will be entitled to the commencement of their benefits within a reasonable time thereafter as if the Plan had been terminated under Section 14.03. 
16.16 Notices. Each Participant, Beneficiary and Alternate Payee shall be responsible for furnishing the Committee with the current and
proper address for the mailing of notices, reports and benefit payments. Any notice required or permitted to be given shall be deemed given if directed to the person to whom addressed at such address and mailed by regular United States mail,
first-class and prepaid. If any check mailed to such address is returned as undeliverable to the addressee, mailing of checks will be suspended until the Participant, Beneficiary or Alternate Payee furnishes the proper address. This provision shall
not be construed as requiring the mailing of any notice or notification if the regulations issued under ERISA deem sufficient notice to be given by the posting of notice in appropriate places, or by any other publication device.

(e)
Ocean After-Tax Contribution Account and Withdrawals. The following provisions shall apply to the Ocean After-Tax Contribution Account of any Participant: 
 


 
(i)
A Participant may, in the manner prescribed by the Committee, request a withdrawal from his Ocean After-Tax Contribution Account. No forfeitures will occur solely as a result of the Participants withdrawal of all
or part of his Ocean After-Tax Contribution Account. After receipt of the request, the Committee shall cause the Trustee to pay over the designated amount in not less than 90 days from the date such request shall have been delivered to the

(ii)
All Ocean After-Tax Contributions made prior to January 1, 1987 will be maintained in a separate subaccount (the Pre-1987 Account) which is part of the Participants Ocean After-Tax
Contribution Account. Withdrawals made from the Pre-1987 Account made under subsection (i) above will not include any earnings attributable to such Pre-1987 Account.

All Ocean After-Tax Contributions made after December 31, 1986 will be maintained in a separate subaccount (the After-1986 Account) which is part of the Participants Ocean After-Tax
Contribution Account. Withdrawals made from the After-1986 Account as provided under subsection (i) above will include earnings attributable to such After-1986 Account. The amount of earnings on Ocean After-Tax Contributions which must be
distributed with each withdrawal will be calculated by multiplying the total amount of earnings then held in the After-1986 Account by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount of Ocean After-Tax Contributions that is included in the
distribution and the denominator of which is the balance of all Ocean After-Tax Contributions then held in the After-1986 Account.

An Ocean Participant who has withdrawn all amounts in his Ocean After-Tax Account and Ocean Rollover Contribution Account may withdraw from his Ocean Employer Matching Contribution Account any or all amounts held in
such Ocean Account that have been so held for 24 months or more, but not in excess of such Participants vested interest in such Ocean Account.   


 
(iii)
An Ocean Participant who has attained age 59 1⁄2 may withdraw from his Ocean Before-Tax Account, his Ocean Employer Matching
Contribution Account and his Ocean Rollover Contribution Account an amount not exceeding such Participants vested interest in the then-value of such Ocean Accounts. Such withdrawal shall come first, from the Participants Ocean Before-Tax
Account, second, from the Participants Vested Interest in his Ocean Employer Matching Contribution Account and, finally, from his Ocean Rollover Contribution Account. 
 


 
(iv)
 An Ocean Participant who has a financial hardship, as determined by the Committee, and who has made all available withdrawals pursuant to this Plan
and pursuant to the provisions of any other plans of the Employer and any Affiliated Company of which he is a member and who has obtained all available loans pursuant to ARTICLE IX and pursuant to the provisions of any other plans of the Employer
and any Affiliated Company of which he is a member may withdraw from his Ocean Employer Matching Contribution Account and his Ocean Before-Tax Account amounts not to exceed the lesser of (1) such Participants vested interest in such Ocean
Accounts or (2) the amount determined by the Committee as being available for withdrawal pursuant to this subsection. Such withdrawal shall come, first, from the Ocean Participants vested interest in his Ocean Employer Matching
Contribution Account and, then, from his Ocean Before-Tax Account. For purposes of this subsection, financial hardship shall mean the immediate and heavy financial needs of the Ocean Participant. A withdrawal based upon financial
hardship pursuant to this subsection shall not exceed the amount required to meet the immediate financial need created by the hardship and not reasonably available from other resources of the Ocean Participant. The amount required to meet the
immediate financial need may include any amounts necessary to pay any federal, state, or local income taxes or penalties reasonably anticipated to result from the distribution. The determination

   E-5 








 

of the existence of an Ocean Participants financial hardship and the amount required to be distributed to meet the need created by the hardship shall be made by the Committee. The decision
of the Committee shall be final and binding, provided that all Participants similarly situated shall be treated in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner. A withdrawal shall be deemed to be made on account of an immediate and heavy financial need of
an Ocean Participant if the withdrawal is for:   


 
(A)
Expenses for medical care described in Code section 213(d) previously incurred by the Ocean Participant, the Ocean Participants spouse, or any dependents of the Ocean Participant (as defined in Code section 152)
or necessary for those persons to obtain medical care described in Code section 213(d) and not reimbursed or reimbursable by insurance;   


 
(B)
Costs directly related to the purchase of a principal residence of the Ocean Participant (excluding mortgage payments);   


 
(C)
Payment of tuition and related educational fees, and room and board expenses, for the next 12 months of post-secondary education for the Ocean Participant or the Ocean Participants spouse, children, or dependents
(as defined in Code section 152);   


 
(D)
Payments necessary to prevent the eviction of the Ocean Participant from his principal residence or foreclosure on the mortgage of the Ocean Participants principal residence; or 
 


 
(E)
Such other financial needs that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue may deem to be immediate and heavy financial needs through the publication of revenue rulings, notices, and other documents of general applicability.
 The above notwithstanding: (1) withdrawals under this subsection from an Ocean Participants Ocean Before-Tax
Account shall be limited to the sum of the Ocean Participants Before-Tax Contributions to the Plan, plus income allocable thereto and credited to the Ocean Participants Ocean Before-Tax Account as of December 31, 1988, less any
previous withdrawals of such amounts, and (2) withdrawals from an Ocean Participants Ocean Employer Contributions Accounts attributable to contributions after December 31, 1988 that constitute income allocable thereto or attributable
to qualified nonelective contributions or qualified matching contributions shall not be permitted. An Ocean Participant who makes a withdrawal from his Ocean Before-Tax Account under this subsection may not make Salary Deferrals under the Plan or
any other qualified or nonqualified plan of the Employer or any Affiliated Company for a period of six months following the date of such withdrawal. Further, such Ocean Participant may not make Salary Deferrals and Roth 401(k)

in any one Plan Year, and no withdrawal shall be made from an Ocean Account to the extent such Ocean Account has been pledged to secure a loan from the Plan.   


 
(iii)
If a Participants Ocean Account from which a withdrawal is made is invested in more than one Investment Fund, the withdrawal shall be made pro rata from each Investment Fund in which such Ocean Account is vested.
