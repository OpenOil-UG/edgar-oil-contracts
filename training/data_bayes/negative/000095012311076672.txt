prior arrangements and prior understandings relating to the subject matter hereof. No
representation, promise, inducement or statement of intention has been made by Seller or Buyer
that is not embodied in this Agreement or in the documents referred to herein, and neither
Seller nor Buyer shall be bound by or liable for any alleged representation, promise, inducement
or statement of intention not so set forth.


               10.9 Waiver or Modification. This Agreement may be amended, modified,
superseded or canceled, and any of the terms, covenants, representations, warranties or
conditions hereof may be waived, only by a written instrument executed by Seller and Buyer, or,
in the case of a waiver or consent, by or on behalf of the Party or Parties waiving compliance
or giving such consent. The failure of any Party at any time or times to require performance of
any provision hereof shall in no manner affect its right at a later time to enforce the same.
No waiver by any Party of any condition, or of any breach of any covenant, agreement,
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement, in any one or more instances, shall be
deemed to be or construed as a further or continuing waiver of any such condition or breach or
waiver of any other condition or of any breach of any other covenant, agreement, representation
or warranty.

               10.12 Interpretation. The Parties stipulate and agree that this Agreement
shall be deemed and considered for all purposes to have been jointly prepared by the Parties,
and shall not be construed against any one Party (nor shall any inference or presumption be
made) on the basis of who drafted this Agreement or any particular provision hereof, who

this Agreement. Each Party agrees that this Agreement has been purposefully drawn and correctly
reflects its understanding of the transaction that it contemplates. In construing this
Agreement, the following principles will apply.






     
    (a)
     
    Defined terms in this Agreement are denoted by quotation
marks. A defined term has its defined meaning throughout this Agreement and
each






 




 















     
     
     
    Exhibit and Schedule to this Agreement, regardless of whether it appears
before or after the place where it is defined.









     
    (b)
     
    Except as allowed by Article 10.1, if there is any conflict
or inconsistency between the provisions of the main body of this Agreement and
the provisions of any Exhibit or Schedule hereto, the provisions of this
Agreement shall take precedence. If there is any conflict between the
provisions of any pro forma assignment document or other transaction documents
attached to this Agreement as an Exhibit or Schedule and the provisions of any
assignment documents and other transaction documents actually executed by the
Parties, the provisions of the executed assignment documents and other executed
transaction documents shall take precedence.









     
    (c)
     
    To the fullest extent permitted by law, all provisions of
this Agreement are hereby deemed incorporated into the Assignments by
reference.









     
    (d)
     
    The Article, Section, Exhibit and Schedule references in
this Agreement refer to the Articles, Sections, Exhibits and Schedules of this

and shall have no significance in interpreting or otherwise affect the meaning
of this Agreement.









     
    (e)
     
    The term knowledge, as applied to each Party, shall mean
the actual knowledge of such Party or such Partys officers, managers, partners
and directors.









     
    (f)
     
    The plural shall be deemed to include the singular, and
vice versa.









     
    (g)
     
    The term including means including, without limitation.









     
    (h)
     
    The term Person (whether or not capitalized) means any
individual, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture,
association, joint-stock company, trust, enterprise, unincorporated
organization, or governmental entity.





         10.13 Third-Party Beneficiaries. It is understood and agreed that there shall
be no third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and that the provisions hereof do not impart
enforceable rights, benefits, or remedies in anyone who is not a Party or a successor of a Party
hereto.


         10.14 Waiver of Deceptive Trade Practices Act. As partial consideration for
this Agreement, each Party hereby expressly waives the provisions of the Texas Deceptive Trade
Practices Consumer Protection Act, Articles 17.41 et seq. of the Texas Business & Commerce Code,
other than Article 17.555 which is not waived, and all other consumer protection laws of the
State of Texas that may be waived by the Parties to the extent permitted by applicable law. Each
Party represents to the other that such Party has had an


 




 


adequate opportunity to submit this waiver to legal counsel for review and comment, and
understands the rights being waived herein.



               10.15 Multiple Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in a number of
identical counterparts, each of which for all purposes is to be deemed as original, and all of
which constitute, collectively, one agreement; but in making proof of this Agreement, it shall
not be necessary to produce or account for more than one such counterpart.


               10.16 Confidentiality. Except as required by law or the provisions of the
indenture for Buyer 9 5/8% senior notes due 2018, following execution of this Agreement, the
Parties shall keep this Agreement and all drafts of this Agreement confidential as required by
this Article 10.16, but may disclose all or any portion of this Agreement to their respective
consultants, attorneys, advisors and current and prospective lenders, investors and
purchasers, who shall be bound by the confidentiality obligations of this Article 10.16.
Similarly, the Parties respective consultants, attorneys, advisors, and current and prospective
lenders, investors, and purchasers may also disclose this Agreement to their respective
consultants, attorneys, advisors and lenders and purchasers, and so on, who shall all be bound
by the confidentiality obligations of this Article 10.16. The foregoing shall not restrict
either Party from disclosing the consummation of this transaction and the transfer of the
Conveyed Properties to Buyer; provided, however, that Buyer shall not disclose the name of J.
Reeves or D. Reeves in any press releases or other public announcements concerning this
transaction.


               All obligations under this Article 10.16 terminate on the earlier of (i) as to a particular
person in receipt of this Agreement, the date that person is required to disclose the Agreement
by a court or other governmental authority or regulations, (ii) the date the Agreement becomes
available to the public other than by breach of this Article 10.16, or (iii) as to the
non-disclosing Party, the date the disclosing Party discloses this Agreement in a manner that
fails to preserve its confidentiality. There shall also be no restriction on either Partys
disclosure of the Agreement in connection with enforcement of its rights under this Agreement,
although should it become necessaryn to file the Agreement in a court proceeding, such Party
will endeavor to file the Agreement under seal.
