 ARTICLE II  QUANTITY  2.1 Delivery Amount. 
(a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof and subject to PXPs rights under Section 2.1(c), PXP agrees to sell and deliver
to CoP, and CoP agrees to receive and purchase from PXP, one hundred percent (100%) of PXPs owned and controlled interest in Sales Volumes produced from the Subject Fields, which production is currently estimated to be 45,000 Barrels per
calendar day (the Delivery Amount).  (b) Not later than ten (10) calendar days prior to the
commencement of each Delivery Month, PXP will notify CoP of its then current good faith, but non-binding, estimate of the Delivery Amount for such Delivery Month and the Delivery Month immediately thereafter, which notice shall generally be in the
form of Exhibit 2 attached hereto (the Estimated Amount).  (c) Set Aside Volume. Notwithstanding
Section 2.1(a), PXP shall be entitled, in accordance with the procedures set forth below, to retain a portion of the Delivery Amount and exclude same from this Agreement (the Set Aside Volume) for the period of time such Set
Aside Volume is in effect as permitted by this Agreement. Upon agreement of the Parties pursuant to Section 2.1(c)(ii), or upon delivery of the Set Aside Volume Election pursuant to Section 2.1(c)(iii), such Set Aside Volume shall be
excluded from this Agreement and CoP shall have no further rights under this Agreement with respect thereto, but such exclusion shall be only for the period of time such Set Aside Volume is in effect as permitted by this Agreement. The procedures
for, and restrictions on, retaining a Set Aside Volume and excluding same from this Agreement are as follows:  (i) PXP shall
have the right to notify CoP in writing no later than June 1 of any given calendar Year if it desires to have any Set Aside Volume (a Preliminary Set Aside Notice). Each such Preliminary Set Aside Notice shall set forth
(A) the percentage (no greater than 10%) of the Delivery Amount that PXP desires to retain (the Election Percentage), (B) a calculation estimating the amount, in Barrels per Day, that such percentage is anticipated to
represent (calculated in accordance with. Section 2.1(c)(iv) and (v)), (C) the Subject Fields from which such Set Aside Volume will be produced, and (D) the Delivery Months that will be subject to such Set Aside Volume. 
(ii) Upon CoPs receipt of a Preliminary Set Aside Notice, the Parties shall endeavor in good faith to negotiate the terms and
conditions upon which CoP would purchase such Set Aside Volume.  (iii) With respect to any given calendar Year in which PXP
provides CoP with a Preliminary Set Aside Notice, if the Parties fail to agree upon the terms and conditions upon which CoP will purchase such Set Aside Volume pursuant to Section 2.1(c)(ii) on or before June 30 of such Year, then PXP
shall have the right, on or before October 1 of such Year, to notify CoP in writing of its intent to sell such Set Aside Volume to a third party (a Set Aside Volume Election). The Set Aside Volume Election may only be made as
to the same Election Percentage, Subject Fields, and Delivery Months as set forth in the Preliminary Set Aside Notice, but shall contain any updated estimated amount, in Barrels per Day, that such Election Percentage is anticipated to represent
(calculated in accordance with Section 2.1 (c)(iv) and (v)). 
   Page 4






 (iv) In estimating the Set Aside Volume, in Barrels per Day, for purposes of the Preliminary
Set Aside Notice and the Set Aside Volume Election, PXP shall multiply the Election Percentage in connection therewith times the average Daily Delivery Amount for the immediately preceding three (3) Delivery Months for which such information is
available, rounding such product to the nearest 1,000 Barrels per Day. The actual Set Aside Volume, in Barrels per Day, for a given delivery Year shall equal the Election Percentage elected for such delivery Year multiplied by the Average Delivery
Amount for the Year immediately preceding such delivery Year rounded to the nearest 1,000 Barrels per Day. For purposes of this Section, the term Average Delivery Amount shall, for a given Year, mean an amount calculated as follows:
 (A) The Parties shall calculate an average of the Daily Delivery Amounts for each of the Delivery Months of June through
November of such Year.  (B) The Parties shall determine the four Delivery Months of such six Delivery Months that have the
highest average Daily Delivery Amount calculated pursuant to clause (A).  (C) The Parties shall calculate the average Daily
Delivery Amount of all Days during the four Delivery Months determined pursuant to clause (B).  (D) The average Daily Delivery
Amount calculated pursuant to clause (C) shall be the Average Delivery Amount for such Year.  In addition, in
making a calculation for a Set Aside Volume, no deduction from the gross amount of average Daily Delivery Amount shall be made for any previous Set Aside Volume.  (v) In calculating the average Daily Delivery Amount for a given Delivery Month for purposes of Section 2.1 (c)(iv), the Parties 
(A) shall not include Delivery Amounts attributable to Subject Fields or interests in Sales Volumes, which Subject Fields or interests in
Sales Volumes were sold by PXP at any time during the period commencing as of the first Day from which such average is being calculated and ending on the last Day prior to the commencement of the relevant delivery Year, and 
(B) shall include an amount, in Barrels per Day, normalized throughout the period over which such average is being calculated, equal to
the average Daily Delivery Amounts attributable to Subject Fields or 
   Page 5






 
interests in Sales Volumes, which Subject Fields or interests in Sales Volumes were acquired by PXP at any time during the period commencing as of the first Day from which such average is being
calculated and ending on the last Day prior to the commencement of the relevant delivery Year.  (vi) Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Set Aside Volume may not include amounts of Sales Volumes from Subject Fields belonging to the Posting Group referred to as Midway Sunset in Exhibit 4 in excess of 25% of the average Daily Delivery Amount (calculated in accordance
with Section 2.1(c)(v) and with respect to the periods required pursuant to Section 2.1(c)(iv)) attributable to all Subject Fields belonging to such Posting Group.  (d) Additional Subject Fields. To the extent not otherwise restricted or prohibited by agreements existing or effective at the time of such acquisition or development, and in all cases subject to
such agreements, all fields and leases in the State of California, or located in California state waters or Federal waters offshore of the State of California, that PXP acquires or develops during the term of this Agreement shall constitute Subject
Fields effective as of the date of such acquisition or development, provided that PXP gives written notice of the pending acquisition or development of such a field or lease as soon as possible prior to its acquisition or development and CoP has
thirty (30) Days from receipt of such notice to notify PXP in writing whether CoP elects to reject said field or lease based on its determination that notwithstanding its exercise of commercially reasonable efforts it will not be able to
process the Sales Volume expected to be produced from such field or lease at, and/or transport such Sales Volume to, one of CoPs California refineries, in which case such field or lease shall not be deemed to be or have been a Subject
Field. If CoP fails to respond in such time period the field or lease will be deemed to be a Subject Field. The pricing and delivery location for Delivery Amounts produced from such additional fields and leases shall be as mutually
agreed by the Parties or as otherwise determined pursuant hereto. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, with respect to fields and leases located within the geographic boundaries of existing Subject Fields or that are otherwise considered by the
applicable regulatory authority to be a part of a field included within a current Subject Field, and provided that the Sales Volumes produced from such fields and leases is of Substantially the Same Quality as that produced from such Subject Field,
then the Parties shall be deemed to have agreed that the pricing and delivery location for Delivery Amounts produced from such fields and leases shall be the same as that for such Subject Field. For purposes of this Agreement, Sales Volumes shall
have Substantially the Same Quality as other Sales Volumes if its sulfur content does not vary from the other by more than 1% by weight, its total acid number (or TAN) does not exceed 0.3 mg and if its gravity does not vary
from the other by more than 5 degrees API. If the Parties fail to agree, and are not otherwise deemed to have agreed, on the pricing and/or delivery location for Delivery Amounts produced from such fields and leases on or before the 30th
calendar day following the acquisition or development of such fields or leases by PXP, then the Parties shall refer the determination of such pricing and delivery location to arbitration pursuant to Section 10.1, and upon such determination,
such pricing and/or delivery location shall thenceforth apply to such fields and leases. During the period, if any, commencing with 
   Page 6






 
the date such fields and leases constitute Subject Fields (the New Fields) and ending upon the last Day of the last Delivery Month ending prior to the agreement of the Parties (or the
decision of the Arbitrator, as applicable) as to pricing and/or delivery location, as applicable (the New Field Pre-Agreement Period), the Parties shall use, for purposes of temporary payment for and delivery of Delivery Amounts from
such New Fields, the pricing and/or delivery location, as applicable, set forth below:  (i) If the delivery location has not
been so agreed or determined by arbitration, the delivery location during the New Field Pre-Agreement Period shall be the location at which Delivery Amounts produced from such New Field pass from equipment or locations owned or controlled by PXP, or
owned or controlled by a third party designated to make delivery on behalf of PXP.  (ii) If the pricing has not been so agreed
or determined by arbitration, the pricing during the New Field Pre-Agreement Period shall be determined as if such New Field belonged to the Posting Group whose Specified Gravity under Exhibit 3 is closest to the average gravity of the
Delivery Amounts then being produced from such Subject Field (and if two such Posting Groups have Specified Gravities that are equally close to such average gravity, then the Posting Group with the higher Specified Gravity shall apply for purposes
of this clause).  From and after the termination of such New Field Pre-Agreement Period, the pricing and delivery location
agreed by the Parties (or selected by the Arbitrator, as applicable), shall thenceforth apply subject to the terms of this Agreement. If the pricing provisions applied during the New Field Pre-Agreement Period differ from those following the New
Field Pre-Agreement Period as a result of the mutual agreement of the Parties or the decision of the Arbitrator, in each case pursuant to this Section, then the Parties shall account for such difference in pricing in the next invoice from CoP
pursuant to this Agreement, which accounting shall be in the form of a credit or debit and which will include interest from the date such New Field Pre-Agreement Period prices were paid until the date of such invoice, calculated at the interest rate
provided in Section 4.2. If any fields or leases acquired or developed by PXP would constitute a Subject Field pursuant to this Section 2.1(d) but for the existence of restrictions or prohibitions contained in agreements existing or
effective at the time of such acquisition, then upon the termination of such restrictions, prohibitions or agreements, such fields and leases shall then be subject to this Section as if the date of such termination was the date of acquisition.
 (e) Additional Interests in Sales Volumes. To the extent not otherwise committed, restricted or prohibited by
agreements existing or effective at the time of such acquisition, and in all cases subject to such agreements, all interests in Sales Volumes production in the State of California, or in California state waters or Federal waters offshore of the
State of California, that PXP acquires during the term of this Agreement shall be included in the Delivery Amount effective as of the date of such acquisition. The pricing and delivery location for such Delivery Amounts shall be mutually agreed by
the Parties or as otherwise determined pursuant hereto. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, with respect to additional interests in Sales Volumes produced from a Subject Field, which Sales Volumes are of Substantially the Same Quality as that
produced from such Subject 
   Page 7






 
Field, the Parties shall be deemed to have agreed that the pricing and delivery location for such Delivery Amounts shall be the same as that for such Subject Field. If the Parties fail to agree,
and are not otherwise deemed to have agreed, on the pricing and delivery location for such additional Delivery Amounts on or before the 30th calendar day following the acquisition of such interest in Sales Volumes by PXP, then the Parties shall
refer the determination of such pricing and delivery location to arbitration pursuant to Section 10.1, and upon such determination, such pricing and/or delivery location shall thenceforth apply to such Delivery Amounts. During the period, if
any, commencing with the date such interest in Sales Volumes are included in the Delivery Amount (the New Volumes) and ending upon the last Day of the last Delivery Month ending prior to the agreement of the Parties (or the decision of
the Arbitrator, as applicable) as to pricing and/or delivery location, as applicable (the New Volume Pre-Agreement Period), the Parties shall use, for purposes of temporary payment for and delivery of such Delivery Amounts, the pricing
and/or delivery location, as applicable, set forth below:  (i) If the delivery location has not been so agreed or determined by
arbitration, the delivery location during the New Volume Pre-Agreement Period shall be the location at which such Delivery Amounts pass from equipment or locations owned or controlled by PXP, or owned or controlled by a third party designated to
make delivery on behalf of PXP.  (ii) If the pricing has not been so agreed or determined by arbitration, the pricing during
the New Volume Pre-Agreement Period shall be determined as if such Delivery Amounts were produced from a Subject Field belonging to the Posting Group whose Specified Gravity under Exhibit 3 is closest to the average gravity of such
Delivery Amounts (and if two such Posting Groups have Specified Gravities that are equally close to such average gravity, then the Posting Group with the higher Specified Gravity shall apply for purposes of this clause). 
From and after the termination of such New Volume Pre-Agreement Period, the pricing and delivery location agreed by the Parties (or
selected by the Arbitrator, as applicable), shall thenceforth apply subject to the terms of this Agreement. If the pricing provisions applied during the New Volume Pre-Agreement Period differ from those following the New Volume Pre-Agreement Period
as a result of the mutual agreement of the Parties or the decision of the Arbitrator, in each case pursuant to this Section, then the Parties shall account for such difference in pricing in the next invoice from CoP pursuant to this Agreement, which
accounting shall be in the form of a credit or debit and which will include interest from the date such New Volume Pre-Agreement Period prices were paid until the date of such invoice, calculated at the interest rate provided in Section 4.2. If
any interest in Sales Volumes acquired by PXP would be included in the Delivery Amount pursuant to this Section 2.2(e) but for the existence of commitments, restrictions or prohibitions contained in agreements existing or effective at the time
of such acquisition, then upon the termination of such commitments, restrictions, prohibitions or agreements, such interests in Sales Volumes shall then be subject to this Section as if the date of such termination was the date of acquisition.

 (f) Quality. The Delivery Amount delivered hereunder shall be merchantable, meeting
the requirements of the approved tariff of the first common carrier pipeline involved.  (g) Planned Refinery
Maintenance. CoP shall notify PXP in writing as far in advance as practical of the time and expected duration of planned maintenance of CoPs Santa Maria or Rodeo refineries that is reasonably expected to affect CoPs ability to
transport and/or store Sales Volumes hereunder. During any such planned maintenance of which CoP has so notified PXP, CoP shall be excused from its obligation to accept delivery of or to pay for Sales Volume to the extent that: 
(i) such Sales Volume includes a volume of barrels in excess of (A) 9,000 barrels/day, minus (B) the number of barrels that PXP
is able to store in its own facilities consistent with past practices between the Parties, and  (ii) CoP is in fact unable to
transport and/or store such Sales Volumes,  provided that the Parties shall cooperate in efforts to store excess production at
a PXP facility and/or to arrange for alternate transportation so as to avoid or minimize the need to shut in any PXP production of the Sales Volumes.  2.2 Disclaimer of Implied Warranties. PXP AND COP EACH ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS ENTERED INTO THIS AGREEMENT BASED SOLELY ON THE EXPRESS REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES,
COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS SET FORTH HEREIN AND, SUBJECT TO THE EXPRESS REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS SET FORTH HEREIN, COP ACCEPTS SALES VOLUMES DELIVERED HEREUNDER AS IS. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN
THIS AGREEMENT, COP EXPRESSLY NEGATES, AS TO THE DELIVERY AMOUNTS, ANY OTHER REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, COVENANT OR AGREEMENT, WRITTEN OR ORAL, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO
(A) CONFORMITY TO MODELS OR SAMPLES, (B) MERCHANTABILITY, OR (C) FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. 
ARTICLE III 
PRICING/TAXES  3.1
Delivery Amount Price.   


 
(a)
Basic Calculation. The price to be paid by CoP for each Barrel of the Delivery Amount produced from a given Subject Field in a given Posting Group during a given
Delivery Month (each, a Delivery Amount Price), subject to Section 3.2(a) and (b), shall be as follows:   


 
(i)
Buena Vista Posting Group. The price to be paid for the Buena Vista Posting Group shall be equal to *****. 
   Page 9









 
(ii)

(iii)
OCS Posting Group. The price to be paid for the OCS Posting Group shall be equal to *****. 
(b) Uniform Deliveries. In computing the Delivery Amount Price for the Delivery Amount hereunder for a given Delivery Month, it
shall be assumed that such Delivery Amount was delivered in equal daily quantities during such Delivery Month.  (c) Truck
Receipts. Subject to Section 3.2(a)(iii), the Delivery Amount Price for Delivery Amount shall be unaffected by whether such Delivery Amount is received by truck or by pipeline carrier. CoP shall arrange for the scheduling of trucks for
receipt of Delivery Amounts that are not delivered to a pipeline carrier.  3.2 Adjustments. 
(a) Delivery Amount Price. The following adjustments shall apply to the Delivery Amount Prices: 
(i) Subject Field Pricing Differential. The Delivery Amount Price for a given Subject Field shall be adjusted by the Subject
Field Pricing Differential set forth in Exhibit 4 for such Subject Field.  (ii) Additional Pricing Adjustment. The
Delivery Amount Price for all Sales Volumes delivered to or for the benefit of CoP shall be increased by $.05 per Barrel. 
(iii) Trucking Costs. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, for Delivery Amounts received by truck, CoP may deduct the
actual cost of trucking from the Delivery Amount Price payable pursuant to this Agreement with respect thereto; provided, however, that if any such Delivery Amount could have been delivered to a pipeline carrier and is delivered by truck at
CoPs election, such cost of trucking shall not be deducted.  (iv) Gravity Adjustment. The Delivery Amount Price
for a given Subject Field and Delivery Month shall be adjusted, upward or downward as applicable, by the product obtained by multiplying:  (A) the average of the gravity price adjustments (in $/barrel/degree API) published by each of the four Major Posters for such Delivery Month for crude oil of the gravity produced from such Subject Field,
by  (B) the difference obtained by subtracting:  (x) the Specified API Gravity set forth in Exhibit 3 for the Posting Group to which such Subject Field belongs, from 
   Page 10






 (y) the average gravity (in degrees API) for Sales Volumes delivered from such Subject
Field for each Day during such Delivery Month.  For purposes of Section 3.2(a)(iv)(A), if greater than one but fewer than
four Major Posters have published gravity price adjustments for such Delivery Month for crude oil produced in California, then the Parties shall use the average of such Major Posters. If only one or less Major Posters have so published gravity price
adjustments, then the Parties shall mutually agree upon the appropriate gravity adjustment for purposes of Section 3.2(a)(iv)(A) and failing such agreement, the gravity adjustment shall be determined pursuant to Section 3.2(b)(iii).
 (v) Point Pedernales and Lompoc Adjustments. The Delivery Amount Price for Sales Volumes produced from the Subject
Fields designated as Point Pedernales and Lompoc in Exhibit 1 shall be adjusted for location differential in accordance with Exhibit 4 and also for sulfur. The sulfur adjustment shall be *****. 
(vi) Point Arguello Adjustment. The Delivery Amount Price for Sales Volumes produced from the Subject Field designated as Point
Arguello shall not bear a Gravity Adjustment, nor shall it bear an adjustment for sulfur content.  (vii) Arroyo Grande
Adjustment. The Delivery Amount Price for Sales Volumes produced from the Subject Field designated as Arroyo Grande shall not receive ***** but rather shall be based only on *****. 
(b) Periodic Pricing Adjustment. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the pricing formulas set forth in this Agreement utilize
appropriate pricing mechanisms and publications and fairly reflect the markets that are available for the Sales Volumes subject hereto. As the Parties recognize that such pricing mechanisms, publications or markets may change materially during the
term of this Agreement, the Parties hereby agree to the following procedures for periodically evaluating (and potentially adjusting) such pricing formulas to reflect the fair market value of the Sales Volumes. 
(i) In the event that, during the term of this Agreement, either Party determines, in good faith, that the pricing formulas set forth in
this Agreement for one or more Subject Fields materially vary from the fair market pricing for the relevant Sales Volumes for such Subject Fields, then such Party may propose a change in the pricing under this Agreement for such Subject Fields to
take effect commencing upon the 1st anniversary of this Agreement and each anniversary thereafter, by giving the other Party written notice of the proposed change no later than ninety (90) calendar days prior to such anniversary date. If a
Party gives such notice in accordance herewith, and the Parties agree on any such change in the pricing for such Subject Fields, such change shall take effect as of such anniversary date. If the Parties fail to agree upon such new pricing for any
such Subject Field by thirty (30) calendar days prior to such anniversary date, either 
   Page 11






 
Party may submit the issue for resolution in accordance with Section 10.1; provided that such Party submits such issue for resolution prior to such anniversary date. Although the Parties are
encouraged to engage in dialogue, written or otherwise, regarding pricing and pricing changes under this Agreement, including under this Section, a Party may only formally invoke the provisions of this Section 3.2(b)(i) once per anniversary
date listed above. Until a Party asserts in writing that it has formally invoked its rights under this Section, it shall in no way be limited in its rights to propose or discuss pricing changes hereunder. Either Party shall have the right to request
that the other Party confirm in writing whether it has, through its written correspondence, formally invoked this Section with respect to a given anniversary date, and until receipt of an affirmative response to such request for confirmation, the
requesting Party shall be under no obligation to respond to such correspondence.  (ii) In the event that, during the term of
this Agreement, either Party determines, in good faith, that there has occurred a material change to the quality specifications attributable to, or any other material component used for determining, the price for one or more Subject Fields, then
such Party may propose a change in the pricing for such Subject Fields under this Agreement to take effect commencing upon the 1st anniversary of this Agreement and each anniversary thereafter by giving the other Party written notice of the proposed
change no later than ninety (90) calendar days prior to such anniversary date. If a Party gives such notice in accordance herewith, and the Parties agree on any such change in the pricing for such Subject Fields, such change shall take effect
as of such anniversary date. If the Parties fail to agree upon such new pricing for any such Subject Field by thirty (30) calendar days prior to such anniversary date, either Party may submit the issue for resolution in accordance with
Section 10.1; provided that such Party submits such issue for resolution prior to such anniversary date. Although the Parties are encouraged to engage in dialogue, written or otherwise, regarding pricing and pricing changes under this
Agreement, including under this Section, a Party may only formally invoke the provisions of this Section 3.2(b)(ii) once per anniversary date listed above. Until a Party asserts in writing that it has formally invoked its rights under this
Section, it shall in no way be limited in its rights to propose or discuss pricing changes hereunder. Either Party shall have the right to request that the other Party confirm in writing whether it has, through its written correspondence, formally
invoked this Section with respect to a given anniversary date, and until receipt of an affirmative response to such request for confirmation, the requesting Party shall be under no obligation to respond to such correspondence. 
(iii) In the event that, during the term of this Agreement, only one or fewer Major Posters are publishing gravity price adjustments for
crude oil produced in California, and the Parties are unable to agree upon the gravity adjustment for purposes of Section 3.2(a)(iv)(A), then either Party may submit the issue for resolution in accordance with Section 10.1. 
   Page 12






 (iv) In the event of any dispute resolution pursuant to Section 10.1, the pricing
formulas hereunder shall, subject hereto, remain in effect pending the written decision of the Arbitrator. If the decision of the Arbitrator results in a change in pricing,  (A) the change will be retroactive to the anniversary date on which the pricing change was to be effective pursuant to this Section 3.2(b), and 
(B) the Parties shall make a cash settlement to reflect such retroactivity of the pricing change (together with interest at the rate
calculated in accordance with Section 4.2) within twenty (20) calendar days after the Arbitrators written decision is delivered.  (v) Any pricing change in accordance with this Section shall constitute an amendment to this Agreement without further action, but the Parties shall take such steps as reasonably requested by either Party
to further evidence such amendment.  (vi) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Parties agree that if any
material change to the pricing methodology results in a material disadvantage or harm to a Party, the Parties agree to immediately discuss and attempt to resolve such issue.  (vii) If for any reason pricing for the benchmark crudes of ***** stop being reported or another crude type becomes the benchmark, either Party has the right to renegotiate the affected pricing benchmark
upon 30 days written notification to the other Party. The Parties agree to mutually review the applicability of the benchmarks on no less than a quarterly basis.  (viii) The price negotiated for future pricing periods should most closely reflect future expectations taking into consideration the current state of the market, recent trends that justify the current
market, recent negotiated contracts with third parties (appropriately weighted and verified) and the impact of waterborne deliveries.  3.3
Taxes. CoP shall reimburse PXP for all taxes imposed by federal, state or local governments, other than taxes on income, assessed on PXP, directly or indirectly in connection with and occasioned by the transfer of title of Sales
Volumes delivered under this Agreement. Each Party shall be solely responsible for any taxes assessed on it pursuant to Sections 8670.40 or 8670.48, or applicable successor Sections, of the California Government Code. If CoP is entitled to purchase
any such Delivery Amount free of any tax (state or federal), CoP shall furnish PXP the proper exemption certificate.

9.1 Credit Requirements.   (a) Credit Rating. Subject to Section 9.1(b), if CoP shall fail to maintain a long term issuer rating of BB or higher with Standard & Poors Ratings Group, then, within thirty
(30) calendar days of receiving a written request from PXP for additional financial assurances, CoP shall provide PXP with (i) a guaranty of payment and performance from its ultimate direct or indirect parent corporation in a form
acceptable to PXP, or (ii) if such parent corporation is unable or otherwise fails to issue such a guaranty or fails to maintain its credit rating at the level specified above, a standby letter of credit in a format and issued by a bank
acceptable to PXP for an amount equal to the sum of the amounts due hereunder for the two prior Delivery Months.  (b) Lack
of Rating Publication. If Standard & Poors Rating Group shall cease to publish a long term issuer rating for CoP, the Parties shall mutually agree to the use of a substitute rating service and shall require the maintenance of a
rating by such substitute service that provides the closest approximation of the credit quality characterized by rating set forth in Section 9.1(a).  (c) Letters of Credit. Any letter of credit provided pursuant to this Section 9.1 shall, subject to this Section, be for a one-Year period and automatically renewable for

   Page 20






 
successive one-Year periods unless the issuing bank provides notice of non-renewal at least sixty (60) calendar days prior to maturity, in which case a substitute bank acceptable to PXP
shall issue such letter of credit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the then remaining obligations to deliver Sales Volumes under this Agreement of PXP are for a period of less than one Year, then such letter of credit may be for a period ending
forty-five (45) calendar days after the last such scheduled delivery of Sales Volumes. Provided that CoP or its ultimate direct or indirect parent maintains its credit rating at the level specified above, then a parent guaranty meeting the
above requirements may be substituted for any letter of credit delivered hereunder. In the event that CoP is required to provide a parent guaranty or letter of credit hereunder and then subsequently re-establishes a credit rating at or above the
level set forth above for a period of 12 consecutive months, the obligation to provide a parent guaranty or a letter of credit pursuant to this Section 9.1 shall be suspended so long as CoP maintains its credit rating at the level specified for
CoP above.  9.2 Financial Responsibility. If during the term of this Agreement, the financial responsibility of a Party becomes
such that such Partys ability to perform its obligations hereunder is impaired or unsatisfactory to the other Party, in its good faith, (the Demanding Party) then in any such case advance cash payment, properly endorsed negotiable
bills of lading, or satisfactory security shall be given upon written demand, and performance hereunder may be withheld by the Demanding Party until such payment, bills of lading, or security is received. If such payment, bills of lading, or
security is not received within fifteen (15) calendar days from demand therefor, the Demanding Party may terminate this Agreement. In the event either Party makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors or any general arrangement with
creditors, or if there are instituted by or against either Party proceedings in bankruptcy or under any insolvency law or law for reorganization, receivership or dissolution, the other Party may withhold shipments or terminate this Agreement without
notice. The exercise by either Party of any right under this paragraph shall be without prejudice to any claim for damages or any other right under this Agreement or applicable law. 
ARTICLE X 
DISPUTES  10.1
Pricing Disputes. Any and all disputes related to pricing pursuant to Section 3.2(b), or pricing or delivery location of newly acquired leases, fields or interests in Sales Volumes pursuant to Section 2.1(d) or 2.1(e),
or the pipeline price pursuant to Section 11.22, of this Agreement shall be finally settled by arbitration pursuant to this Section 10.1:  (a) The Parties hereby agree and consent to submit to the American Arbitration Association any and all such disputes for settlement by final and binding arbitration by one (1) arbitrator (the
Arbitrator) pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association in effect as of the date of this Agreement (the Rules). The resulting decision of the Arbitrator shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy between the Parties regarding any and all such disputes.  (b) Arbitration proceedings pursuant to
this Section shall be held in Los Angeles, California, or such other location as the Parties may agree. To the extent that it is 
   Page 21






 
necessary to apply substantive law, the substantive law of the State of California shall be applied, without reference to conflicts of law rules that would direct the matter to the law of another
jurisdiction.  (c) The Parties shall initiate arbitration proceedings hereunder in accordance with Section 6 of the Rules.
The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to agree upon and appoint the Arbitrator, who shall have not less than fifteen (15) Years of experience (commercial or legal) related to the marketing of domestic crude oil (not less than
five (5) Years of which shall relate to such marketing in California). In the event that the Parties fail to appoint the Arbitrator within fifteen (15) calendar days after the American Arbitration Association receives the notice of
arbitration, each Party shall submit to the American Arbitration Association a list containing the names of three (3) persons who meet the qualifications set out above that it nominates to serve as the Arbitrator. The Parties shall instruct the
American Arbitration Association to appoint the Arbitrator (from the names submitted by each Party in accordance herewith) within forty-five (45) calendar days after it receives the notice of arbitration. Should a Party fail to submit a list of
names, the American Arbitration Association shall appoint the Arbitrator from the names submitted. Should both Parties fail to submit a list of names, the American Arbitration Association shall appoint the Arbitrator it deems appropriate within
forty-five (45) calendar days after it receives the notice of arbitration.  (d) Within sixty (60) calendar days after
the American Arbitration Association receives the notice of arbitration, each Party shall submit to the Arbitrator in writing its proposed resolution to such dispute and any information it considers relevant to the Arbitrators decision. The
failure of a Party to make such a submission or the absence or default of a Party to the arbitration shall not prevent or hinder the arbitration procedure in any stage. The arbitration shall continue in accordance with Section 30 of the Rules.
 (e) The Parties shall instruct the Arbitrator to select, as its decision, the resolution proposed by one of the Parties. If
only one Party submits a proposed resolution in accordance with this Agreement, the Arbitrator shall select that resolution as its decision. The Parties shall instruct the Arbitrator to render its decision in writing to the Parties within ninety
(90) calendar days after the American Arbitration Association receives the notice of arbitration. The decision of the Arbitrator shall be final and binding on all Parties. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Parties shall instruct the Arbitrator that the standard by which it shall resolve such disputes under this Section 10.1 shall be which Partys resolution of such pricing dispute best reflects the then current fair market pricing for the
relevant production from the relevant Subject Fields.  (f) The Parties agree to exclude any right of application or appeal to
the courts of any jurisdiction in connection with the arbitration proceedings, the subject matter of the arbitration proceedings or the decision of the Arbitrator, except for the purpose of enforcement of a decision of the Arbitrator to the extent
providing for a change to the method for calculating the Delivery Amount Price hereunder, as provided in Section 10.1(g) below. 
   Page 22






 (g) Any written decision of the Arbitrator providing for a change to the method for
calculating the Delivery Amount Price hereunder shall be deemed to constitute an amendment to this Agreement without the necessity of formally amending this Agreement. Any such decision of the Arbitrator effecting a pricing change shall be valid and
enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction.  (h) Nothing in this Section 10.1 shall limit the Parties
remedies or rights to seek judicial resolution with respect to disputes under this Agreement to the extent not involving pricing or otherwise directed by this Agreement to be resolved by arbitration pursuant to this Agreement. 
10.2 Other Disputes.  (a) Except for arbitration proceedings commenced in accordance with Section 10.1, any legal action taken in connection with this Agreement will be brought in a state court or U.S. Federal District
Court having subject matter jurisdiction and sitting in Harris County, Texas. PXP and CoP each irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of such courts.  (b) Each Party irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claim or objection that it may have, now or hereafter, that venue or personal jurisdiction is not proper with respect to any
such legal action or legal proceeding brought in a court set out above, including, without limitation, any claim that such legal action or legal proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum and any claim that a Party is not subject to
personal jurisdiction or service of process.  (c) EACH PARTY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY DISPUTE RELATING TO OR
ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, AND AGREES TO TAKE ANY AND ALL ACTION NECESSARY OR APPROPRIATE TO EFFECT SUCH WAIVER.

use its best efforts to enter into an agreement with the assignee of the sold interests on the same terms and conditions set forth herein, to the extent such terms and conditions apply to such interests. Notwithstanding Section 11.3(a), with
respect to any such interests that are sold, this Agreement (other than with respect to Section 3.2(a)(viii) and other than with respect to Section 11.9) shall be binding on CoP and the successors in interest to PXP of such interests
without the prior written consent of CoP.  11.4 Force Majeure. If either Party is rendered unable, wholly or in part, by Force
Majeure to perform its obligations hereunder, other than to make payments due hereunder, the affected Party shall give written notice to the other Party of such Force Majeure within forty-eight (48) hours after such failure to perform, and the
obligations of the affected Party shall be suspended during the continuance and to the extent of the inability so caused, but for no longer period. In the event that any such period of suspension shall continue in excess of ninety (90) calendar
days, this Agreement may be terminated as to the Subject Fields subject to such suspension at the option of either Party, without liability of either Party. Any such failure to perform shall be remedied with all reasonable dispatch, but PXP shall
not be required to supply substitute quantities of Sales Volumes from other sources of supply. Failure to perform this Agreement due to events of Force Majeure shall not extend the term of this Agreement. 
11.5 Waiver. No waiver by any Party of any one or more defaults by another Party in the performance of this Agreement shall operate or be
construed as a waiver of any future default or defaults by the same Party, whether of a like or of a different character. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, no Party shall be deemed to have waived, released or modified any of its rights
under this Agreement unless such Party has expressly stated, in writing, that it does waive, release or modify such right.  11.6 Entire
Agreement. The Parties agree that effective January 1, 2012, this Agreement contains the entire agreement of the Parties for the sale of the Delivery Amount from the Subject Fields, and supersedes and replaces in its entirety all prior

to take any action, or to prohibit PXP from taking any action, regarding operations of or with respect to the Subject Fields. Specifically, but not by way of limitation, CoP acknowledges and agrees that PXP shall have no obligation to drill,
produce, or abandon any well, or to achieve any specific production volumes. CoP acknowledges and agrees that all decisions with respect to such actions and operations are expressly and exclusively within PXPs control. 
11.8 Severability. If and for so long as any provision of this Agreement shall be deemed or judged to be invalid for any reason whatsoever,
such invalidity shall not affect the validity or operation of any other provisions of this Agreement except only so far as shall be necessary to give effect to the construction of such invalidity, and any such invalid provision shall be deemed
severed from this Agreement without affecting the validity of the balance of this Agreement.  11.9 Audit. Each Party and its
duly authorized representatives shall have access to the accounting records and other documents maintained by the other Party that relate to Sales Volumes sold under this Agreement, and shall have the right to audit such records at any reasonable
