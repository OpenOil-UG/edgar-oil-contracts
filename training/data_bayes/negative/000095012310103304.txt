SECOND AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT 



     This Second Amendment to Credit Agreement (this Second Amendment) is entered
into as of September 30, 2010, by and among Denbury Resources Inc., a Delaware corporation
(Borrower), JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent (Administrative
Agent), and the financial institutions parties hereto as Banks (hereinafter collectively
referred to as Executing Banks, and each individually, an Executing Bank).


W I T N E S S E T H



     WHEREAS, Borrower, Administrative Agent, the other agents party thereto and Banks are parties
to that certain Credit Agreement dated as of March 9, 2010 (as amended, the Credit
Agreement) (unless otherwise defined herein, all terms used herein with their initial letter
capitalized shall have the meaning given such terms in the Credit Agreement, including, to the
extent applicable, after giving effect to the amendments set forth in Section 1 of this
Second Amendment);


     WHEREAS, pursuant to the Credit Agreement, Banks have made a Revolving Loan to Borrower and
provided certain other credit accommodations to Borrower;


     WHEREAS, Borrower has advised Administrative Agent and Banks that the loss of gas production
as a result of a possible sale of the Haynesville Assets (the Haynesville Sale) may cause
the Credit Parties to have (a) hedged more than 100% of their reasonably anticipated projected
production from Proved Mineral Interests of gas as prohibited by Section 9.11(a)(i) of the Credit
Agreement, and (b) total production of gas that is less than the aggregate amount of gas which is
the subject of Oil and Gas Hedge Transactions as prohibited by Section 9.11(b)(ii) of the Credit
Agreement (collectively, the Temporary Gas Hedging Noncompliance), in each case during
the period commencing on the effective date of the Haynesville Sale and continuing through and
including May 1, 2011 (such period, the Specified Period), which Temporary Gas Hedging
Noncompliance would be prohibited by Section 9.17 of the Credit Agreement;


     WHEREAS, Borrower has requested that Banks (a) amend certain terms of the Credit Agreement to
provide Borrower and the other Credit Parties additional time to complete a sale of the Haynesville
Assets and to make certain other changes thereto as more specifically described herein, (b) provide
a limited waiver of any Temporary Gas Hedging Noncompliance that may occur during the Specified
Period and (c) reaffirm the existing Borrowing Base;


     WHEREAS, subject to and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, Executing Banks have
agreed to Borrowers requests; and


     NOW THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements herein
contained and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged and confessed, Borrower, Administrative Agent and Executing Banks hereby agree
as follows:


1

     1.2 Amendment to Definition. The definition of Loan Papers contained in

Section 2. Limited Waiver. In reliance on the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained in this Second Amendment, and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions
precedent set forth in Section 4 hereof, Banks hereby consent to the Temporary Gas Hedging
Noncompliance during the Specified Period; provided, that Borrower will not, nor
will Borrower permit any other Credit Party to, enter into any Hedge Transaction for gas during the
Specified Period unless such Hedge Transaction, together with any other existing Hedge Transactions
for gas, will not cause a violation of Sections 9.11 and 9.17 of the Credit Agreement. Borrower
acknowledges and agrees that the limited waiver set forth in this Section 2 is limited
solely to Sections 9.11(a)(i), 9.11(b)(ii) and 9.17 of the Credit Agreement and applies solely with
respect to the Temporary Gas Hedging Noncompliance during the Specified Period caused as a direct

scheduled for May 1, 2011, unless there is a Special Redetermination or other redetermination or
adjustment of the Borrowing Base prior to such time. The Borrower and Executing Banks agree that
the reaffirmation of the Borrowing Base provided for in this Section 3 shall constitute the
Scheduled Redetermination of the Borrowing Base scheduled for November 1, 2010 and shall not be
construed or deemed to be a Special Redetermination for the purposes of Section 4.3 of the Credit
Agreement.


Section 4. Conditions Precedent to Amendment. The amendments contained in Section
1 hereof, the limited waiver provided in Section 2 hereof and the reaffirmation of the
Borrowing Base contained in Section 3 hereof shall be effective on the date that each of
the following conditions precedent is satisfied (the Effective Date):



     Counterparts. Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof duly
executed by Borrower and Required Banks and acknowledged by each Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the
case of any party as to which an executed counterpart shall not have been received, telegraphic,
telecopy, or other written confirmation from such party of execution of a counterpart hereof by
such party).


     4.1 No Default. No Default or Event of Default shall have occurred which is
continuing.


     4.2 Other Documents. Administrative Agent shall have been provided with such
documents, instruments and agreements, and Borrower shall have taken such actions, in each


3

and the transactions contemplated hereby.


Section 5. Representations and Warranties. To induce Executing Banks and Administrative
Agent to enter into this Second Amendment, Borrower hereby represents and warrants to Banks and
Administrative Agent as follows:



     5.1 Reaffirm Existing Representations and Warranties. Each representation and
warranty of Borrower contained in the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Papers is true and
correct in all material respects on the date hereof and will be true and correct in all material
respects after giving effect to the amendments set forth in Section 1 hereof, except that
any representation or warranty that is qualified by material or Material Adverse Effect
references therein shall be true and correct in all respects.


     5.2 Due Authorization; No Conflict. The execution, delivery and performance by
Borrower of this Second Amendment are within Borrowers corporate or organizational powers, have
been duly authorized by all necessary action, require no action by or in respect of, or filing
with, any governmental body, agency or official and do not violate or constitute a default under
any provision of applicable law or any Material Agreement binding upon Borrower or any other Credit
Party or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any of the assets of Borrower or any
other Credit Party other than Liens securing the Obligations.


     5.3 Validity and Enforceability. This Second Amendment constitutes the valid and
binding obligation of Borrower enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as (i) the
enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting
creditors rights generally, and (ii) the availability of equitable remedies may be limited by
equitable principles of general application.


Section 6. Miscellaneous.



     6.1 Reaffirmation of Loan Papers. Any and all of the terms and provisions of the
Credit Agreement and the Loan Papers shall, except as amended and modified hereby, remain in full
force and effect. The amendments contemplated hereby shall not limit or impair any Liens securing
the Obligations, each of which are hereby ratified, affirmed and extended to secure the Obligations
as they may be increased pursuant hereto.


     6.2 Parties in Interest. All of the terms and provisions of this Second Amendment
shall bind and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns.

preparation, negotiation and execution of this Second Amendment and all related documents.

parties need not execute the same counterpart; however, no party shall be bound by this


4




 


Second Amendment until Borrower, Required Banks and each Restricted Subsidiary have executed a
counterpart. Facsimiles shall be effective as originals.



     6.5 Complete Agreement. THIS SECOND AMENDMENT, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER
LOAN PAPERS REPRESENT THE FINAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY
EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS OR ORAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES. THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL
AGREEMENTS BETWEEN OR AMONG THE PARTIES.


     6.6 Headings. The headings, captions and arrangements used in this Second Amendment
are, unless specified otherwise, for convenience only and shall not be deemed to limit, amplify or
