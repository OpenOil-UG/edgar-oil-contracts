bailee for the Successor Agent for the benefit and on behalf of the Successor Agent and the Secured Parties until such time as such possessory collateral has been delivered to the Successor Agent.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any reference to the Existing Agent in any publicly filed document, to the extent such filing relates to the liens and security interests in any collateral assigned hereby and until such filing is modified to reflect the interests of the Successor Agent, shall, with respect to such liens and security interests, constitute a reference to the Existing Agent as collateral representative of the Successor Agent (provided that the parties hereto agree that the Existing Agents role as such collateral representative shall impose no further duties, obligations or liabilities on the Existing Agent, including, without limitation, any duty to take any type of direction regarding any action to be taken against such collateral, whether such direction comes from the Successor Agent, the Secured Parties or otherwise, and the Existing Agent shall have the full benefit of all of the protective provisions of Article IX (The Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender) and Section 10.07 (Indemnification) of the Credit Agreement, while serving in such capacity).  The Existing Agent agrees to deliver all possessory collateral to the Successor Agent on or promptly following the Effective Date, and the Successor Agent agrees to take possession thereof upon such tender by the Existing Agent.
 
Section 2.  Amendments to Credit Agreement.  Section 1.01 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by deleting BNP Paribas where it appears in the definition of Prime Rate and substituting the Administrative Agent in lieu thereof.
 
Section 3.  Waiver of Notices.  The Borrower and the Required Lenders hereby waive any notice, timing or other requirement of the Credit Agreement or the other Loan Documents (including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 9.06 of the Credit Agreement) related to the resignation of the Existing Agent and/or the Existing Issuing Bank or the appointment or designation of the Successor Agent and/or the Successor Issuing Bank.
 
Section 4.  Representations and Warranties.  Each party hereto hereby represents and warrants on and as of the Effective Date that it is legally authorized to enter into and has duly executed and delivered this Agreement.
 
Section 5.  Notices.  Commencing as of the Effective Date, notices to the Successor Agent and the Successor Issuing Bank in respect of the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be directed as follows (and any notice provisions of the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents are hereby amended to reflect such notice information):
