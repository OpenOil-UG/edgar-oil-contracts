This Fifth Amendment constitutes notice to the Borrowers of the redetermined Borrowing Base for purposes of Section 2.07(c).  As of the Fifth Amendment Effective Date the Aggregate Elected Commitment is $325,000,000.  By its signature to this Agreement each Lender consents to the $400,000,000 redetermined Borrowing Base and acknowledges the $325,000,000 Aggregate Elected Commitment.  Each Lender agrees that, subject to any changes in such Lenders Applicable Percentage and/or Elected Commitment pursuant to Section 2.06(c) of the Credit Agreement, from the Fifth Amendment Effective Date until the next Borrowing Base redetermination such Lenders Commitment shall be the least of (i) such Lenders Maximum Credit Amount, (ii) such Lenders Applicable Percentage of the redetermined Borrowing Base and (iii) such Lenders Elected Commitment.

Report as of June 30, 2014 (or July 1, 2014), which Reserve Report shall be delivered by September 1, 2014 in accordance with Section 8.12(a)(ii) of the Credit Agreement.
 
6.             Fees.  On the Fifth Amendment Effective Date, the Borrowers shall pay to the Administrative Agent (a) for the account of each Lender increasing its Commitment pursuant to this Fifth Amendment, an upfront fee equal to forty (40) basis points (0.40%) of the amount by which such Lenders Commitment exceeds its Commitment immediately prior to the Fifth Amendment Effective Date and (b) for the account of each Additional Lender, if any, an upfront fee equal to forty (40) basis points (0.40%) of its Commitment.  On the Fifth Amendment Effective Date, such fees shall be non-refundable and deemed to be fully earned when paid.
 
7.             Borrowers Ratification.  Each of the Borrowers hereby ratifies all of its Obligations under the Credit Agreement and each of the Loan Documents to which it is a party, and agrees and acknowledges that the Credit Agreement and each of the Loan Documents to which it is a party are and shall continue to be in full force and effect. Nothing in this Fifth Amendment extinguishes, novates or releases any right, claim, Lien, security interest or entitlement of any of the Lenders, the Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent created by or contained in any of such documents nor is any Borrower released from any covenant, warranty or obligation created by or contained herein or therein.
 
8.             Guarantors Ratification.  Each Guarantor by its execution in the space provided below under ACKNOWLEDGED for purposes of Section 8 hereby ratifies, confirms, acknowledges and agrees that its obligations under the Guaranty are in full force and effect and that such Guarantor continues to unconditionally and irrevocably guarantee the full and punctual payment, when due, whether at stated maturity or earlier by acceleration or otherwise, of the Obligations, and its execution and delivery of this Fifth Amendment does not indicate or establish an approval or consent requirement by any Guarantor under the Guaranty in connection with the execution and delivery of amendments to the Credit Agreement, the Notes or any of the other Loan Documents (other than the Guaranty or any other Loan Document to which a Guarantor is a party).
 
9.             Conditions to Effectiveness of Fifth Amendment.  This Fifth Amendment shall be effective upon the satisfaction, in the Administrative Agents sole discretion, of the following conditions precedent:
 
(i)                                     The Administrative Agent shall have executed, and shall have received from each of the Borrowers and the Lenders duly executed signature pages to, this Fifth Amendment, and shall have received a duly executed acknowledgement of Section 8 of this Fifth Amendment from each Guarantor;
 
(ii)                                  the Administrative Agent shall have received such other documents as the Administrative Agent or its counsel may reasonably request; and
 
(iii)                               the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall have received all fees and other amounts due and payable, including, to the extent invoiced, reimbursement or 
 
14






 
payment of all out-of-pocket expenses required to be reimbursed or paid by the Borrowers hereunder.
 
10.          No Implied Amendment, Waiver or Consent. This Fifth Amendment shall not constitute an amendment or waiver of any provision not expressly referred to herein and shall not be construed as a consent to any action on the part of the Borrowers that would require a waiver or consent of the Lenders or Required Lenders, as applicable, or an amendment or modification to any term of the Loan Documents except as expressly stated herein.
 
11.          Miscellaneous.  This Fifth Amendment is a Loan Document.  Except as affected by this Fifth Amendment, the Loan Documents are unchanged and continue in full force and effect.  However, in the event of any inconsistency between the terms of the Credit Agreement, as amended by this Fifth Amendment, and any other Loan Document, the terms of the Credit Agreement will control and the other document will be deemed to be amended to conform to the terms of the Credit Agreement.  All references to the Credit Agreement will refer to the Credit Agreement as amended by this Fifth Amendment and any other amendments properly executed among the parties.  Borrowers agree that all Loan Documents to which they are a party (whether as an original signatory or by assumption of the Obligations) remain in full force and effect and continue to evidence their respective legal, valid and binding obligations enforceable in accordance with their terms (as the same are affected by this Fifth Amendment or are amended in connection with this Fifth Amendment).  AS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND LENDERS PARTY HERETO TO ENTER INTO THIS FIFTH AMENDMENT, BORROWERS RELEASE THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, THE ISSUING BANK, THE LENDERS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE PREDECESSORS, SUCCESSORS, ASSIGNS, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, TRUSTEES, AGENTS AND ATTORNEYS FROM ANY LIABILITY FOR ACTIONS OR FAILURES TO ACT IN CONNECTION WITH THE LOAN DOCUMENTS PRIOR TO THE FIFTH AMENDMENT EFFECTIVE DATE.  NO COURSE OF DEALING BETWEEN BORROWERS OR ANY OTHER PERSON, ON THE ONE HAND, AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, ISSUING BANK AND THE LENDERS, ON THE OTHER, WILL BE DEEMED TO HAVE ALTERED OR AMENDED THE CREDIT AGREEMENT OR AFFECTED EITHER BORROWERS, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENTS, THE ISSUING BANKS OR THE LENDERS RIGHT TO ENFORCE THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AS WRITTEN.  This Fifth Amendment will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each of the undersigned and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
 
12.          Form.  Each agreement, document, instrument or other writing to be furnished to the Administrative Agent and/or the Lenders under any provision of this instrument must be in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and its counsel.
 
13.          Headings. The headings and captions used in this Fifth Amendment are for convenience only and will not be deemed to limit, amplify or modify the terms of this Fifth Amendment, the Credit Agreement, or the other Loan Documents.
 
15






 
14.          Interpretation. Wherever possible each provision of this Fifth Amendment shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Fifth Amendment shall be prohibited by or invalid under such law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Fifth Amendment.
 
15.          Multiple Counterparts.  This Fifth Amendment may be separately executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to constitute one and the same agreement.  This Fifth Amendment may be transmitted and/or signed by facsimile, telecopy or electronic mail.  The effectiveness of any such documents and signatures shall, subject to applicable law, have the same force and effect as manually-signed originals and shall be binding on all Loan Parties, all Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank.  The Administrative Agent may also require that any such documents and signatures be confirmed by a manually-signed original thereof; provided, however, that the failure to request or deliver the same shall not limit the effectiveness of any facsimile document or signature.
 
16.          Governing Law.  THIS FIFTH AMENDMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO ANY CHOICE-OF-LAW PROVISIONS THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION.
