   - 6 -

notwithstanding, the maximum liability of each Guarantor hereunder and under the other Loan Documents shall in no event exceed the amount which can be guaranteed by such Guarantor under applicable federal and state laws relating to the insolvency of
debtors (after giving effect to the right of contribution established in Section 2.02).  (c) Each

remedies of any Secured Party hereunder.  (d) Each Guarantor agrees that if the maturity of the Borrower
Obligations is accelerated by bankruptcy or otherwise, such maturity shall also be deemed accelerated for the purpose of this guarantee without demand or notice to such Guarantor. Unless released pursuant to Section 9.14, the guarantee of each

or any payment received or collected from such Guarantor in respect of the Borrower Obligations), remain liable for the Borrower Obligations up to the maximum liability of such Guarantor hereunder until the Borrower Obligations are paid in full in
cash.  Section 2.02 Right of Contribution. Each Guarantor hereby agrees that to the extent that a Guarantor shall
have paid more than its proportionate share of any payment made hereunder, such Guarantor shall be entitled to seek and receive contribution from and against any other Guarantor hereunder which has not paid its proportionate share of such payment.
Each Guarantors right of contribution shall be subject to the terms and conditions of Section 2.03. The provisions of this Section 2.02 shall in no respect limit the obligations and liabilities of any Guarantor to the Secured
Parties, and each Guarantor shall remain liable to the Secured Parties for the full amount guaranteed by such Guarantor hereunder.  Section 2.03 No Subrogation. Notwithstanding any payment made by any Guarantor hereunder or any set-off or application of funds of any Guarantor by any Secured Party, no Guarantor shall be
entitled to exercise its rights to be subrogated to any of the rights of any Secured Party against the Borrower or any other Guarantor or any collateral security or guarantee or right of offset held by any Secured Party for the payment of the
Borrower Obligations, nor shall any Guarantor seek any indemnity, exoneration, participation, contribution or reimbursement from the Borrower or any other Guarantor in respect of payments made by such Guarantor hereunder, until all amounts owing to
the Secured Parties on account of the Borrower Obligations are irrevocably and indefeasibly paid in full in cash. If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor on account of such subrogation rights at any time when all of the Borrower Obligations
shall not have been irrevocably and indefeasibly paid in full in cash, such amount

Agreement.  Section 2.04 Guaranty Amendments, Etc. with respect to the Borrower Obligations. Each Guarantor shall
remain obligated hereunder, and such Guarantors obligations hereunder shall not be released, discharged or otherwise affected, notwithstanding that, without any reservation of rights against any Guarantor and without notice to, demand upon or
further assent by any Guarantor (which notice, demand and assent requirements are hereby expressly waived by such Guarantor): (a) any demand for payment of any of the Borrower Obligations made by any Secured Party may be rescinded by such
Secured Party or otherwise and any of the Borrower Obligations continued; (b) the Borrower Obligations, the liability of any other Person upon or for any part thereof or any collateral security or guarantee therefor or right of offset with
respect thereto, may, from time to time, in whole or in part, be renewed, extended, amended, modified, accelerated, compromised, waived, surrendered or released by, or any indulgence or forbearance in respect thereof granted by, any Secured Party;
(c) any Secured Document may be amended, modified, supplemented or terminated, in whole or in part, as the Secured Parties may deem advisable from time to time; (d) any collateral security, guarantee or right of offset at any time held by

release of sureties generally.  Section 2.05 Waivers. Each Guarantor hereby waives any and all notice of the
creation, renewal, extension or accrual of any of the Borrower Obligations and notice of or proof of reliance by any Secured Party upon the guarantee contained in this Article II or acceptance of the guarantee contained in this Article II;
the Borrower Obligations, and any of them, shall conclusively be deemed to have been created, contracted or incurred, or renewed, extended, amended or waived, in reliance upon the guarantee contained in this Article II and no notice of creation
of the Borrower Obligations or any extension of credit already or hereafter contracted by or extended to the Borrower need be given to any Guarantor; and all dealings between the Borrower and any of the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Secured
Parties, on the other hand, likewise shall be conclusively presumed to have been had or consummated in reliance upon the guarantee contained in this Article II. Each Guarantor waives, to the extent permitted by applicable law, diligence,
presentment, protest, demand for payment and notice of default or nonpayment to or upon the Borrower or any of the Guarantors with respect to the Borrower Obligations.

(a) Each Guarantor understands and agrees that the guarantee contained in this Article II is, and shall be construed

occurred. Upon request of the Administrative Agent, such Grantor shall execute and deliver, and have recorded, any and all agreements, instruments, documents, and papers as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request to evidence the
Administrative Agents and the Lenders security interest in any Copyright, Patent or Trademark and the goodwill and general intangibles of such Grantor relating thereto or represented thereby. 
(g) Such Grantor will take all reasonable and necessary steps, including, without limitation, in any proceeding before the
United States Patent and Trademark Office, the United States Copyright Office or any similar office or agency in any other country or any political subdivision thereof, to maintain and pursue each application (and to obtain the relevant
registration) and to maintain each registration of the material Intellectual Property, including, without limitation, filing of applications for renewal, affidavits of use and affidavits of incontestability. 
(h) In the event that any material Intellectual Property is infringed, misappropriated or diluted by a third party, such
Grantor shall (i) take such actions as such Grantor shall reasonably deem appropriate under the circumstances to protect such Intellectual Property and (ii) if such Intellectual Property is of material economic value, promptly notify the
Administrative Agent after it learns thereof and sue for infringement, misappropriation or dilution, to seek injunctive relief where appropriate and to recover any and all damages for such infringement, misappropriation or dilution. 
Section 5.10 Commercial Tort Claims. If such Grantor shall obtain an interest in any Commercial Tort Claim with an asserted
value in excess of $1,000,000, such Grantor shall within 30 days of obtaining such interest sign and deliver documentation acceptable to the Administrative Agent that grants a security interest under the terms and provisions of this Agreement in and
to such Commercial Tort Claim.

   - 21 -






 (b) Upon the request of the Administrative Agent at any time after the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, each Grantor shall notify obligors on the Receivables that the Receivables have been assigned to the Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties and that payments

notwithstanding, each Grantor shall remain liable under each of the Receivables to observe and perform all the conditions and obligations to be observed and performed by it thereunder, all in accordance with the terms of any agreement giving rise
thereto. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any obligation or liability under any Receivable (or any agreement giving rise thereto) or Contract by reason of or arising out of this Agreement or the receipt by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender of any payment relating thereto, nor shall the Administrative Agent or any Lender be obligated in any manner to perform any of the obligations of any Grantor under or pursuant to any Receivable (or any agreement
giving rise thereto) or Contract, to make any payment, to make any inquiry as to the nature or the sufficiency of any payment received by it or as to the sufficiency of any performance by any party thereunder, to present or file any claim, to take
any action to enforce any performance or to collect the payment of any amounts which may have been assigned to it or to which it may be entitled at any time or times.  Section 6.03 Pledged Securities.  (a) Unless an Event
of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and the Administrative Agent shall have given notice to the relevant Grantor of the Administrative Agents intent to exercise its corresponding rights pursuant to Section 6.03(b), each
Grantor shall be permitted to receive all cash dividends paid in respect of the Pledged Securities and all payments made in respect of the Pledged Notes, in each case paid in the normal course of business of the relevant Issuer and consistent with
past practice, to the extent permitted in the Credit Agreement, and to exercise all voting and corporate or other organizational rights with respect to the Investment Property; provided, however, that no vote shall be cast or corporate or other
organizational right exercised or other action taken which, in the Administrative Agents reasonable judgment, would impair the Collateral or which would be inconsistent with or result in any violation of any provision of the Credit Agreement,
this Agreement or any other Loan Document.  (b) If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing and the
Administrative Agent shall give notice of its intent to exercise such rights to the relevant Grantor or Grantors, during the pendancy of such Event of Default, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement (i) the Administrative Agent shall have the
right to receive any and all cash dividends, payments or other Proceeds paid in respect of the Investment Property and make application thereof to the Obligations in such order as the Administrative Agent may determine, and (ii) any or all of
the Investment Property shall be registered in the name of the Administrative Agent or its nominee, and the Administrative Agent or its nominee may thereafter and during the pendancy of such Default exercise (A) all voting, corporate and other
rights pertaining to such Investment Property at any meeting of shareholders of the relevant Issuer or Issuers or otherwise and (B) any and all rights of conversion, exchange and subscription and any other rights, privileges or options
pertaining to such Investment Property as if it were the absolute owner thereof (including, without limitation, the right to exchange at its discretion any and all of the Investment Property upon the merger, consolidation, reorganization,

   - 22 -






 
recapitalization or other fundamental change in the corporate or other organizational structure of any Issuer, or upon the exercise by any Grantor or the Administrative Agent of any right,
privilege or option pertaining to such Investment Property, and in connection therewith, the right to deposit and deliver any and all of the Investment Property with any committee, depositary, transfer agent, registrar or other designated agency
upon such terms and conditions as the Administrative Agent may determine), all without liability except to account for property actually received by it, but the Administrative Agent shall have no duty to any Grantor to exercise any such right,
privilege or option and shall not be responsible for any failure to do so or delay in so doing.  (c) Each
Grantor hereby authorizes and instructs each Issuer of any Investment Property pledged by such Grantor hereunder to (i) comply with any instruction received by it from the Administrative Agent in writing that (A) states that an Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing and (B) is otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, without any other or further instructions from such Grantor, and each Grantor agrees that each Issuer shall be fully protected in so
complying, and (ii) unless otherwise expressly permitted hereby, pay any dividends or other payments with respect to the Investment Property directly to the Administrative Agent. 
Section 6.04 Proceeds to be Turned Over to Administrative Agent. In addition to the rights of the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders specified in Section 6.01 with respect to payments of Receivables, if an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, all Proceeds received by any Grantor consisting of cash, checks and other near-cash items shall be held by such
Grantor in trust for the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, segregated from other funds of such Grantor, and shall, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, forthwith upon receipt by such Grantor, be turned over to the Administrative Agent in the
exact form received by such Grantor (duly indorsed by such Grantor to the Administrative Agent, if required). All such Proceeds received by the Administrative Agent hereunder shall be held by the Administrative Agent in a Collateral Account
maintained under its sole dominion and control. All such Proceeds while held by the Administrative Agent in a Collateral Account (or by such Grantor in trust for the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) shall continue to be held as collateral
security for all the Obligations and shall not constitute payment thereof until applied as provided in Section 6.05. 
Section 6.05 Application of Proceeds. At such intervals as may be agreed upon by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent,
or, if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, at any time at the Administrative Agents election, the Administrative Agent may, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, apply all or any part of Proceeds constituting
Collateral, whether or not held in any Collateral Account, and any proceeds of the guarantee set forth in Article II, in payment of the Obligations in accordance with Section 10.02(c) of the Credit Agreement. 
Section 6.06 Code and Other Remedies. 
(a) If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Secured Parties, may,
subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, exercise, in addition to all other rights and remedies granted to them in this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and in any other instrument or agreement securing, evidencing or relating to the

   - 23 -






 
Obligations, all rights and remedies of a secured party under the UCC or any other applicable law or otherwise available at law or equity. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Administrative Agent, without demand of performance or other demand, presentment, protest, advertisement or notice of any kind (except any notice required by law referred to below) to or upon any Grantor or any other Person (all and each of which
demands, defenses, advertisements and notices are hereby waived), may in such circumstances forthwith collect, receive, appropriate and realize upon the Collateral, or any part thereof, and/or may forthwith sell, lease, assign, give option or
options to purchase, or otherwise dispose of and deliver the Collateral or any part thereof (or contract to do any of the foregoing), in one or more parcels at public or private sale or sales, at any exchange, brokers board or office of any
Secured Party or elsewhere upon such terms and conditions as it may deem advisable and at such prices as it may deem best, for cash or on credit or for future delivery without assumption of any credit risk. Any Secured Party shall have the right
upon any such public sale or sales, and, to the extent permitted by law, upon any such private sale or sales, to purchase the whole or any part of the Collateral so sold, free of any right or equity of redemption in any Grantor, which right or
equity is hereby waived and released. Each Grantor further agrees, at the Administrative Agents request, to assemble the Collateral and make it available to the Administrative Agent at places which the Administrative Agent shall reasonably
select, whether at such Grantors premises or elsewhere. Any such sale or transfer by the Administrative Agent either to itself or to any other Person shall be absolutely free from any claim of right by any Grantor, including any equity or
right of redemption, stay or appraisal which any Grantor has or may have under any rule of law, regulation or statute now existing or hereafter adopted (and each Grantor hereby waives any rights it may have in respect thereof). Upon any such sale or
transfer, the Administrative Agent shall have the right to deliver, assign and transfer to the purchaser or transferee thereof the Collateral so sold or transferred. The Administrative Agent shall apply the net proceeds of any action taken by it
pursuant to this Section 6.06, after deducting all reasonable costs and expenses of every kind incurred in connection therewith or incidental to the care or safekeeping of any of the Collateral or in any way relating to the Collateral or the
rights of the Administrative Agent and the Secured Parties hereunder, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements, to the payment in whole or in part of the Obligations, in accordance with Section 10.02(c)
of the Credit Agreement, and only after such application and after the payment by the Administrative Agent of any other amount required by any provision of law, including, without limitation, Section 9-615(a)(3) of the UCC, need the
Administrative Agent account for the surplus, if any, to any Grantor. To the extent permitted by applicable law, each Grantor waives all claims, damages and demands it may acquire against the Administrative Agent or any Secured Party arising out of
the exercise by them of any rights hereunder except to the extent caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent or such Secured Party or their respective agents. If any notice of a proposed sale or other
disposition of Collateral shall be required by law, such notice shall be deemed reasonable and proper if given at least 10 days before such sale or other disposition. 
(b) In the event that the Administrative Agent elects not to sell the Collateral, the Administrative Agent retains its
rights to dispose of or utilize the Collateral or any part or parts thereof in any manner authorized or permitted by law or in equity, and to apply the proceeds of the same towards payment of the Obligations. Each and every method of disposition of
the Collateral described in this Agreement shall constitute disposition in a commercially reasonable manner. Without limitation of the foregoing, any disposition involving three (3) or more bidders that are accredited investors
(within the meaning of the Securities Act) shall constitute disposition in a commercially reasonable manner. 
   - 24 -






 (c) The Administrative Agent may appoint any Person as agent to perform any
act or acts necessary or incident to any sale or transfer of the Collateral.  Section 6.07 Registration Rights.
 (a) If the Administrative Agent shall determine to exercise its right to sell any or all of the Pledged
Securities pursuant to Section 6.06, and if in the opinion of the Administrative Agent it is necessary or advisable to have the Pledged Securities, or that portion thereof to be sold, registered under the provisions of the Securities Act, the
relevant Grantor will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Issuer thereof to (i) execute and deliver, and cause the directors and officers of such Issuer to execute and deliver, all such instruments and documents, and do or cause to
be done all such other acts as may be, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent, necessary or advisable to register the Pledged Securities, or that portion thereof to be sold, under the provisions of the Securities Act, (ii) use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the registration statement relating thereto to become effective and to remain effective for a period of one year from the date of the first public offering of the Pledged Securities, or that portion
thereof to be sold and (iii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Issuer to make all amendments thereto and/or to the related prospectus which, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent, are necessary or advisable to enable it
to realize upon such Collateral, all in conformity with the requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission applicable thereto. Each Grantor agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts
to cause such Issuer to comply with the provisions of the securities or Blue Sky laws of any and all jurisdictions which the Administrative Agent shall designate and to make available to its security holders, as soon as practicable, an
earnings statement (which need not be audited) which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act.  (b) Each Grantor recognizes that the Administrative Agent may be unable to effect a public sale of any or all the Pledged Securities, by reason of certain prohibitions contained in the Securities Act and
applicable state securities laws or otherwise, or may determine that a public sale is impracticable or not commercially reasonable, and, accordingly, may resort to one or more private sales thereof to a restricted group of purchasers which will be
obliged to agree, among other things, to acquire such securities for their own account for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. Each Grantor acknowledges and agrees that any such private sale may result in prices and
other terms less favorable than if such sale were a public sale and, notwithstanding such circumstances, agrees that any such private sale shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner. The Administrative Agent shall be under
no obligation to delay a sale of any of the Pledged Securities for the period of time necessary to permit the Issuer thereof to register such securities for public sale under the Securities Act, or under applicable state securities laws, even if
such Issuer would agree to do so. 
   - 25 -






 (c) Each Grantor agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to do or
cause to be done all such other acts as may be necessary to make such sale or sales of all or any portion of the Pledged Securities pursuant to this Section 6.07 valid and binding and in compliance with any and all other applicable Governmental
Requirements. Each Grantor further agrees that a breach of any of the covenants contained in this Section 6.07 will cause irreparable injury to the Secured Parties, that the Secured Parties have no adequate remedy at law in respect of such
breach and, as a consequence, that each and every covenant contained in this Section 6.07 shall be specifically enforceable against such Grantor, and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, such Grantor hereby waives and agrees not
to assert any defenses against an action for specific performance of such covenants except for a defense that no Event of Default has occurred under the Credit Agreement.  Section 6.08 Waiver; Deficiency. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, each Grantor waives and agrees not to assert any rights or privileges which it may acquire under the UCC.
Each Grantor shall remain liable for any deficiency if the proceeds of any sale or other disposition of the Collateral are insufficient to pay its Obligations and the fees and disbursements of any attorneys employed by the Administrative Agent or
any Secured Party to collect such deficiency.  Section 6.09 Non-Judicial Enforcement. The Administrative Agent may
enforce its rights hereunder without prior judicial process or judicial hearing, and to the extent permitted by law, each Grantor expressly waives any and all legal rights which might otherwise require the Administrative Agent to enforce its rights
by judicial process.  ARTICLE VII  The Administrative Agent  Section 7.01 Administrative Agents
Appointment as Attorney-in-Fact, Etc.  (a) Each Grantor hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the
Administrative Agent and any officer or agent thereof, with full power of substitution, as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority in the place and stead of such Grantor and in the name of such Grantor or in
its own name, for the purpose of carrying out the terms of this Agreement, to take any and all appropriate action and to execute any and all documents and instruments which may be necessary or desirable to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement,
and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Grantor hereby gives the Administrative Agent the power and right, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, on behalf of such Grantor, without notice to or assent by such Grantor, to do any
or all of the following:  (i) in the name of such Grantor or its own name, or otherwise, take possession of and
indorse and collect any checks, drafts, notes, acceptances or other instruments for the payment of moneys due under any Receivable or Contract or with respect to any other Collateral and file any claim or take any other action or proceeding in any
court of law or equity or otherwise deemed appropriate by the Administrative Agent for the purpose of collecting any and all such moneys due under any Receivable or Contract or with respect to any other Collateral whenever payable; 
   - 26 -






 (ii) in the case of any Intellectual Property, execute and deliver, and have
recorded, any and all agreements, instruments, documents and papers as the Administrative Agent may request to evidence the Administrative Agents and the Secured Parties security interest in such Intellectual Property and the goodwill
and general intangibles of such Grantor relating thereto or represented thereby;  (iii) pay or discharge Taxes
and Liens levied or placed on or threatened against the Collateral, effect any repairs or any insurance called for by the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document and pay all or any part of the premiums therefor and the costs thereof;
 (iv) execute, in connection with any sale provided for in Section 6.06 or Section 6.07, any
indorsements, assignments or other instruments of conveyance or transfer with respect to the Collateral; and 
(v) (A) direct any party liable for any payment under any of the Collateral to make payment of any and all moneys due or
to become due thereunder directly to the Administrative Agent or as the Administrative Agent shall direct; (B) ask or demand for, collect, and receive payment of and receipt for, any and all moneys, claims and other amounts due or to become due
at any time in respect of or arising out of any Collateral; (C) sign and indorse any invoices, freight or express bills, bills of lading, storage or warehouse receipts, drafts against debtors, assignments, verifications, notices and other
documents in connection with any of the Collateral; (D) in the name of such Grantor, or in its own name, or otherwise, commence and prosecute any suits, actions or proceedings at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction to
collect the Collateral or any portion thereof and to enforce any other right in respect of any Collateral; (E) defend any suit, action or proceeding brought against such Grantor with respect to any Collateral; (F) settle, compromise or
adjust any such suit, action or proceeding and, in connection therewith, give such discharges or releases as the Administrative Agent may deem appropriate; (G) assign any Copyright, Patent or Trademark (along with the goodwill of the business
to which any such Copyright, Patent or Trademark pertains), throughout the world for such term or terms, on such conditions, and in such manner, as the Administrative Agent shall in its sole discretion determine; and (H) generally, sell,
transfer, pledge and make any agreement with respect to or otherwise deal with any of the Collateral as fully and completely as though the Administrative Agent were the absolute owner thereof for all purposes, and do, at the Administrative
Agents option and such Grantors expense, at any time, or from time to time, all acts and things which the Administrative Agent deems necessary to protect, preserve or realize upon the Collateral and the Administrative Agents and
the Secured Parties security interests therein and to effect the intent of this Agreement, all as fully and effectively as such Grantor might do.  Anything in this Section 7.01(a) to the contrary notwithstanding, the Administrative Agent agrees that it will not exercise any rights under the power of attorney provided for in this
Section 7.01(a) unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.  (b) If any Grantor
fails to perform or comply with any of its agreements contained herein, the Administrative Agent, at its option, but without any obligation so to do, may perform or comply, or otherwise cause performance or compliance, with such agreement.

   - 27 -






 (c) The expenses of the Administrative Agent incurred in connection with
actions undertaken as provided in this Section 7.01, together with interest thereon at the post-default rate specified in Section 3.02(c) of the Credit Agreement, but in no event to exceed the Highest Lawful Rate, from the date of payment
by the Administrative Agent to the date reimbursed by the relevant Grantor, shall be payable by such Grantor to the Administrative Agent on demand.  (d) Each Grantor hereby ratifies all that said attorneys shall lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue hereof. All powers, authorizations and agencies contained in this Agreement are coupled with an
interest and are irrevocable until this Agreement is terminated and the security interests created hereby are released. 
Section 7.02 Duty of Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agents sole duty with respect to the custody, safekeeping
and physical preservation of the Collateral in its possession, under Section 9-207 of the UCC or otherwise, shall be to deal with it in the same manner as the Administrative Agent deals with similar Property for its own account, and the
Administrative Agent shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of the Collateral in its possession if the Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which comparable secured parties accord
comparable collateral. Neither the Administrative Agent, any Secured Party nor any of their Related Parties shall be liable for failure to demand, collect or realize upon any of the Collateral or for any delay in doing so or shall be under any
obligation to sell or otherwise dispose of any Collateral upon the request of any Grantor or any other Person or to take any other action whatsoever with regard to the Collateral or any part thereof. The powers conferred on the Administrative Agent
and the Secured Parties hereunder are solely to protect the Administrative Agents and the Secured Parties interests in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon the Administrative Agent or any Secured Party to exercise any such
powers. The Administrative Agent and the Secured Parties shall be accountable only for amounts that they actually receive as a result of the exercise of such powers, and neither they nor any of their Related Parties shall be responsible to any
Grantor for any act or failure to act hereunder, except for their own gross negligence or willful misconduct. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Administrative Agent shall be under no duty whatsoever to make or give any
presentment, notice of dishonor, protest, demand for performance, notice of non-performance, notice of intent to accelerate, notice of acceleration, or other notice or demand in connection with any Collateral or the Obligations, or to take any steps
necessary to preserve any rights against any Grantor or other Person or ascertaining or taking action with respect to calls, conversions, exchanges, maturities, tenders or other matters relative to any Collateral, whether or not it has or is deemed
to have knowledge of such matters. Each Grantor, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waives any right of marshaling in respect of any and all Collateral, and waives any right to require the Administrative Agent or any Secured Party to proceed
against any Grantor or other Person, exhaust any Collateral or enforce any other remedy which the Administrative Agent or any Secured Party now has or may hereafter have against any Grantor or other Person. 
Section 7.03 Execution of Financing Statements. Pursuant to the UCC and any other applicable law, each Grantor authorizes the
Administrative Agent to file or record financing statements and other filing or recording documents or instruments with respect to the Collateral without the signature of such Grantor in such form and in such offices as the Administrative

   - 28 -






 
Agent determines appropriate to perfect the security interests of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement. A photographic or other reproduction of this Agreement shall be sufficient as a
financing statement or other filing or recording document or instrument for filing or recording in any jurisdiction. Each Grantor authorizes the Administrative Agent to use the collateral description all personal property or all
assets in any such financing statements. Each Grantor hereby ratifies and authorizes the filing by the Administrative Agent of any financing statement with respect to the Collateral made prior to the date hereof. 
Section 7.04 Authority of Administrative Agent. Each Grantor acknowledges that the rights and responsibilities of the
Administrative Agent under this Agreement with respect to any action taken by the Administrative Agent or the exercise or non-exercise by the Administrative Agent of any option, voting right, request, judgment or other right or remedy provided for
herein or resulting or arising out of this Agreement shall, as between the Administrative Agent and the Secured Parties, be governed by the Credit Agreement and by such other agreements with respect thereto as may exist from time to time among them,
but, as between the Administrative Agent and the Grantors, the Administrative Agent shall be conclusively presumed to be acting as agent for the Secured Parties with full and valid authority so to act or refrain from acting, and no Grantor shall be
under any obligation, or entitlement, to make any inquiry respecting such authority.  ARTICLE VIII 
Subordination of Indebtedness  Section 8.01 Subordination of All Grantor Claims. As used herein, the term Grantor Claims shall mean all debts and obligations of the Borrower or any other Grantor to any
other Grantor, whether such debts and obligations now exist or are hereafter incurred or arise, or whether the obligation of the debtor thereon be direct, contingent, primary, secondary, several, joint and several, or otherwise, and irrespective of
whether such debts or obligations be evidenced by note, contract, open account, or otherwise, and irrespective of the Person or Persons in whose favor such debts or obligations may, at their inception, have been, or may hereafter be created, or the
manner in which they have been or may hereafter be acquired by. After and during the continuation of an Event of Default, no Grantor shall receive or collect, directly or indirectly, from any obligor in respect thereof any amount upon the Grantor
Claims.  Section 8.02 Claims in Bankruptcy. In the event of receivership, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement,
debtors relief, or other insolvency proceedings involving any Grantor, the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Administrative Agent and the Secured Parties shall have the right to prove their claim in any such proceeding, so as to establish
their rights hereunder and, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, receive directly from the receiver, trustee or other court custodian, dividends and payments which would otherwise be payable upon Grantor Claims. Subject to the Intercreditor
Agreement, each Grantor hereby assigns such dividends and payments to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Secured Parties for application against the Borrower Obligations as provided under
Section 10.02(c) of the Credit Agreement. Should any Agent or Secured Party receive, for application upon the Obligations, any such dividend or payment which is otherwise payable to any Grantor, and which, as between such Grantors, shall
constitute a credit upon the Grantor Claims, then upon payment in full in cash of the Borrower Obligations, the expiration of all 
   - 29 -






 
Letters of Credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement and the termination of all of the Commitments, the intended recipient shall become subrogated to the rights of the Administrative Agent
and the Secured Parties to the extent that such payments to the Administrative Agent and the Secured Parties on the Grantor Claims have contributed toward the liquidation of the Obligations, and such subrogation shall be with respect to that
proportion of the Obligations which would have been unpaid if the Administrative Agent and the Secured Parties had not received dividends or payments upon the Grantor Claims.  Section 8.03 Payments Held in Trust. In the event that, notwithstanding Section 8.01 and Section 8.02, any Grantor should receive any funds, payments, claims or distributions which
is prohibited by such Sections, then it agrees, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement: (a) to hold in trust for the Administrative Agent and the Secured Parties an amount equal to the amount of all funds, payments, claims or distributions so
received and (b) that it shall have absolutely no dominion over the amount of such funds, payments, claims or distributions except to pay them promptly to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties; and each Grantor
covenants promptly to pay the same to the Administrative Agent.  Section 8.04 Liens Subordinate. Each Grantor
agrees that, until the Borrower Obligations are paid in full in cash, any Liens securing payment of the Grantor Claims shall be and remain inferior and subordinate to any Liens securing payment of the Obligations, regardless of whether such
encumbrances in favor of such Grantor, the Administrative Agent or any Secured Party presently exist or are hereafter created or attach. Without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, no Grantor, during the period in which any of the
Borrower Obligations are outstanding, shall (a) exercise or enforce any creditors right it may have against any debtor in respect of the Grantor Claims or (b) foreclose, repossess, sequester or otherwise take steps or institute any
action or proceeding (judicial or otherwise, including without limitation the commencement of or joinder in any liquidation, bankruptcy, rearrangement, debtors relief or insolvency proceeding) to enforce any Lien held by it. 
Section 8.05 Notation of Records. Upon the request of the Administrative Agent, all promissory notes and all accounts
receivable ledgers or other evidence of the Grantor Claims accepted by or held by any Grantor shall contain a specific written notice thereon that the indebtedness evidenced thereby is subordinated under the terms of this Agreement. 
ARTICLE IX 
Miscellaneous  Section 9.01 No Waiver by Course of Conduct; Cumulative Remedies. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any Secured Party shall by any act (except by a written instrument pursuant to
Section 9.04), delay, indulgence, omission or otherwise be deemed to have waived any right or remedy hereunder or to have acquiesced in any Default or Event of Default. No failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising, on the part of the
Administrative Agent or any Secured Party, and no course of dealing with respect to, any right, power or privilege hereunder, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such right, power or privilege, shall operate as a waiver thereof.
No single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. A waiver by the Administrative Agent or any Secured Party of any
right or 
   - 30 -






 
remedy hereunder on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to any right or remedy which the Administrative Agent or such Secured Party would otherwise have on any future occasion. The

Documents to which it is a party; 
   - 34 -






 (b) neither the Administrative Agent nor any Secured Party has any fiduciary
relationship with or duty to any Grantor arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, and the relationship between the Grantors, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent and Secured Parties, on the

If any of the Collateral shall be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of by any Grantor in a transaction permitted by the Credit Agreement, then immediately upon the
occurrence of any such disposition, all Liens and other rights with respect thereto, shall automatically terminate and be null and void, and the Administrative Agent, at the request and sole expense of such Grantor, shall promptly execute and
deliver to such Grantor all releases or other documents deemed reasonably necessary or desirable by the Borrower to evidence the release of the Liens created hereby on such Collateral. If all the Equity Interests of a Guarantor shall be sold,
transferred or otherwise disposed of in a transaction permitted by the Credit Agreement, then immediately upon the occurrence of such disposition, such Guarantor automatically shall be released from its obligations hereunder, and the Liens and other
rights created hereunder in all property of such Guarantor shall automatically terminate and be null and void; and at the request and sole expense of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall promptly execute and deliver to or at the request of
the Borrower all releases and other documents reasonable necessary or desirable to release such obligations, Liens and other rights; provided that the Borrower shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent, at least fifteen Business Days prior to

action taken or omission to act by the Administrative Agent or the Secured Parties hereunder, including, without limitation, any exercise of voting or consensual rights or any other action taken or inaction, shall be deemed to constitute a retention
of the Collateral in satisfaction of the Obligations or otherwise to be in full satisfaction of the Obligations, and the Obligations shall remain in full force and effect, until the Administrative Agent and the Secured Parties shall have applied
payments (including, without limitation, collections from Collateral) towards the Obligations in the full amount then outstanding or until such subsequent time as is provided in Section 9.14(a). 
Section 9.15 Acceptance. Each Grantor hereby expressly waives notice of acceptance of this Agreement, acceptance on the part
of the Administrative Agent and the Secured Parties being conclusively presumed by their request for this Agreement and delivery of the same to the Administrative Agent.
