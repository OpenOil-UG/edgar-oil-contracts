This Agreement may be accepted by the required form of acceptance established by the Committee pursuant to the Notice, which may include deemed acceptance. If execution of the Notice is the required form of acceptance established by the Committee, then such execution may be in any number of identical counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original for all purposes, but all of which taken together shall form but one agreement.

The Agreement and all Awards granted hereunder are intended to comply with, or otherwise be exempt from, Code Section 409A.  This -3-Agreement and the Award shall be administered, interpreted, and construed in a manner consistent with Code Section 409A or an exemption therefrom.  Should any provision of this Agreement or any Award hereunder be found not to comply with, or otherwise be exempt from, the provisions of the Code Section 409A, such provision shall be modified and given effect (retroactively if necessary), in the sole discretion of the Committee, and without the consent of the Participant, in such manner as the Committee determines to be necessary or appropriate to comply with, or to effectuate an exemption from, Code Section 409A.  Without limiting the foregoing and notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, to the extent required in order to avoid accelerated taxation or tax penalties under Section 409A, amounts that would otherwise be payable and benefits that would otherwise be provided pursuant to this Agreement during the six-month period immediately following the Participant’s separation from service shall instead be paid on the first business day after the date that is six months following the Participant’s termination date (or death, if earlier), with interest from the date such amounts would otherwise have been paid at the short-term applicable federal rate, compounded semi-annually, as determined under Section 1274 of the Code, for the month in which payment would have been made but for the delay in payment required to avoid the imposition of an additional rate of tax on the Participant under Section 409A.  In the event the Award under this Agreement is determined to be subject to Code Section 409A, any payment triggered by a Change of Control or Fundamental Transaction will be made only if, in connection with the Change of Control or Fundamental Transaction, there occurs a change in the ownership of the Company, a change in the effective control of the Company, or a change in ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company as all such terms are defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5).  In the event payment is not allowed by operation of this section, payment will be made within sixty (60) days of the earlier to occur of (A) the applicable payment date set forth in the Notice or (B) the occurrence of a permissible time or event that could trigger a payment without violating Code Section 409A.  Any payments to be made under this Agreement upon a termination of employment shall only be made if such termination of employment constitutes a “separation from service” under Section 409A.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes no representations that the payments and benefits provided under this Agreement comply with Section 409A and in no event shall the Company be liable for all or any portion of any taxes, penalties, interest or other expenses that may be incurred by the Participant on account of non-compliance with Section 409A.-4-Notice of PSU Award Chesapeake Energy CorporationID: 73-13957336100 N.
