Severance Policy
 
It is the policy of Kosmos Energy Ltd. and its subsidiaries (the Company or Kosmos) to offer eligible U.S. employees severance benefits when a termination is initiated by the Company through no fault of the employee in connection with a change in control.  As defined below, Kosmos will offer severance pay, a prorated target bonus, the cash equivalent to cover the cost of benefits continuation, and outplacement services to any employee who meets the defined eligibility requirements.  Severance benefits will be offered according to the attached severance formula matrix.
 
Eligibility
 
In connection with a change in control at Kosmos as defined in the Companys Long Term Incentive Plan (Change in Control), regular full-time U.S. employees whose employment has terminated as a result of the following reasons will generally be eligible for severance benefits:
 
·                  Reduction in the work force.
 
·                  Reorganization of department(s) that results in the elimination of the job.
 
·                  Reorganization of department(s) that results in the diminution of the skills, requirements, aptitudes, or other criteria of the position in a material manner, as determined by the Company in its reasonable discretion, where the employee declines an offer to continue employment in the altered position or another position that the Company deems comparable in its reasonable discretion before any deadline and in the manner prescribed by the Company.
 
·                  Relocation of the job functions outside of a 50-mile radius where the employee is not offered employment at the new location or declines an offer of employment at the new location.
 
Employees will be ineligible for severance benefits where employment terminates for any other reason following a Change in Control.
 
Eligible employees who already have a separate severance agreement with the Company may receive severance benefits only under either that agreement or this Policy.  Under no circumstances may an eligible employee receive severance benefits under both arrangements.
