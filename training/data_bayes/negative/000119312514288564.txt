circumstances, certain other parties (as amended, supplemented, restated or otherwise modified from time to time, the Credit Agreement), together with interest at the rates and calculated as provided in the Credit Agreement. 
Reference is hereby made to the Credit Agreement for matters governed thereby, including, without limitation, certain events which will
entitle the holder hereof to accelerate the maturity of all amounts due hereunder. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Note shall have the respective meanings assigned to such terms in the Credit Agreement. 
This Note is issued pursuant to, is a Note under, and is payable as provided in the Credit Agreement. Subject to compliance with
applicable provisions of the Credit Agreement, Maker may at any time pay the full amount or any part of this Note without the payment of any premium or fee, but such payment shall not, until this Note is fully paid and satisfied, excuse the payment
