Chancellor Board or its advisors,  constitute a violation of any applicable law,
rule or regulation  or otherwise  cause  Chancellor  to lose any exemption  from
registration it may have under applicable laws, rules and regulations.

              ARTICLE II. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF FRANKS

     Franks hereby  represents  and warrants to Chancellor and the Company that,
as of the Closing Date:

     2.1 Franks has all  requisite  power and  authority  to execute and deliver
this Agreement and the Assets and to perform all of his  obligations  under this
Agreement and the Co-Founder Agreement.

     2.2 The execution  and delivery by Franks of this  Agreement and such other
instruments,  agreements and  transactions as may be contemplated  hereunder and
the  consummation  by  Franks  of  the  transactions   contemplated  hereby  and
thereunder  will  not (i)  violate  any  law,  statute,  rule or  regulation  or
judgment, order, writ, injunction or decree of any court,  administrative agency
or  governmental  body,  or (ii)  conflict  with,  result in any  breach  of, or
constitute  a default  (or an event  which with  notice or lapse of time or both
would become a default) under any agreement to which Franks is a party.

     2.3 Franks is the sole owner and  holder of the  Assets,  free and clear of
all liens and other encumbrances, and that Franks has not (a) transferred, sold,
pledged,  hypothecated or otherwise  encumbered any of the Assets or (b) entered

                                       4
<PAGE>
into any agreement,  arrangement or understanding (written or oral) to transfer,
sell, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise encumber any of the Assets.

     2.4 The Assets do not, and the transfer  thereof to the Company and the use
thereof by the Company in its  business  will not,  directly or  indirectly,  in
whole or in part,  infringe upon the  intellectual  property rights of any third
party or violate any applicable laws, rules or regulations.

     2.5 Franks has not incurred and will not incur, directly or indirectly,  as
a result of any action taken or permitted to be taken by or on behalf of Franks,
any liability or obligation to pay any fees or commissions to any broker, finder
or agent in connection  with the execution and  performance of the  transactions
contemplated  herein for which  Chancellor or the Company could become liable or
obligated.

     2.6 Franks does not, directly or indirectly, own any equity interest in any
business  that  competes with the  Company's  business  other than  ownership of
shares of stock of any corporation having a class of equity securities  actively
traded on a national  securities  exchange or on the NASDAQ  Stock  Market which
represent,   in  the  aggregate,   not  more  than  one  percent  (1%)  of  such
corporation's  issued and  outstanding  shares as  determined on a fully diluted
basis.

     2.7 Franks is aware and  understands  that:  (i) neither the Shares nor the
Chancellor Shares have been registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Securities Act" or the "Act"), the securities laws of any state or
the  securities  laws  of  any  other  jurisdiction,  nor is  such  registration
contemplated;  and (ii) no governmental or regulatory  agency has passed upon or
will pass upon the Shares or the Chancellor  Shares or has made or will make any
finding or  determination  as to the fairness of investment in the Shares or the
Chancellor Shares.

     2.8  Franks  is aware and  understands  that the  issuance  and sale of the
Shares and the  Chancellor  Shares are  intended to be exempt from  registration
under the Act by virtue of Section 4(2) of the Act and/or the  provisions of the
regulations  promulgated  thereunder.   In  particular,   Franks  is  aware  and
understands that:

     (a) Franks must bear the economic  risk of an  investment in the Shares and
Chancellor Shares for an indefinite period of time because,  among other things,
(A) the Shares and Chancellor Shares have not been registered under the Act and,
therefore,  cannot be sold unless they are subsequently registered under the Act
or an  exemption  from  such  registration  is  available,  (B) the  Shares  and
Chancellor  Shares have not been registered  under  applicable  state securities
laws and, therefore,  cannot be sold unless they are registered under applicable
state securities laws or an exemption from such  registration is available,  and
(C) there are substantial  restrictions on the transferability of the Shares and
Chancellor  Shares under the governing  documents of the Company and  Chancellor
(including,  without  limitation,  with respect to the Company,  its Articles of
Incorporation,  as amended  from time to time,  and the  Stockholders  Agreement
entered  into on or about the date hereof by and among the  Company,  Chancellor
and Franks;  and with respect to Chancellor,  its Articles of Incorporation,  as
amended, and Bylaws) (all such governing documents collectively,  the "Governing
Documents") and applicable law;

     (b) there is no established  market for the Shares and no market (public or
otherwise) for the Shares will develop in the foreseeable future, if ever;

                                       5
<PAGE>
     (c)  Franks  has no rights to  require  that the  Shares or the  Chancellor
Shares be registered under the Act or the securities laws of various states, and
Franks will not be able to avail  himself of the  provisions of Rule 144 adopted
by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Act with respect to sales of
the Shares; and

     (d)  the  Company  and   Chancellor   will  rely  upon  an  exemption  from
registration which requires Franks to be an "accredited investor" (as defined in
Rule  501(a)  of  Regulation  D  promulgated   under  the  Act,  an  "Accredited
Investor").

     2.9 Franks is an Accredited  Investor  within the meaning of Rule 501(a) of
Regulation D promulgated under the Act.

     2.10 Franks has been advised and  understands  that his  investment  in the
Shares and the Chancellor Shares is illiquid and involves a high degree of risk.
Franks  is  solvent  and not  under  receivership,  has not  become  subject  to
bankruptcy  or  any  similar  proceeding,  has  no  need  for  liquidity  in his
investment in the Shares and/or the  Chancellor  Shares,  has adequate  means of
providing for his current liabilities or other contingencies, has the ability to
bear the economic risk of his  investment  in the Shares  and/or the  Chancellor
Shares  and at the  present  time and in the  foreseeable  future  can  afford a
complete  loss of his  investment in the Shares  and/or the  Chancellor  Shares.
There are no actions,  suits or  proceedings  pending,  or, to the  knowledge of
Franks,  threatened  against or affecting  Franks or the assets of Franks in any
court or before  or by any U.S.  federal,  state,  municipal,  foreign  or other
governmental  department,  commission,  board, bureau, agency or instrumentality
which,  if adversely  determined,  would impair the ability of Franks to perform
his  obligations  in  this  Agreement  as  provided  herein.   Franks's  overall
commitment   to   investments   that   are  not   readily   marketable   is  not
disproportionate to Franks's net worth, and his investment in the Shares and the
Chancellor  Shares will not cause such overall  commitment to become  excessive.
Franks has the capacity to protect his own interest in purchasing the Shares and
the Chancellor  Shares and has determined that the Shares and Chancellor  Shares
are suitable investments for him.

     2.11 Franks has been furnished with, and has read, understands and is fully
familiar  with,  this  Agreement and the Governing  Documents of the Company and
Chancellor,  has  received no general  solicitation  or  advertisements  and has
attended  no public  seminar or other  public  promotional  meeting  relating to
investments  in the  Shares or the  Chancellor  Shares.  No  representations  or
warranties  have been made to Franks by the Company,  Chancellor or any partner,
member,  officer,  employee,  agent,  affiliate or subsidiary of either of them,
other than the  representations of the Company and Chancellor in this Agreement.
Franks has not  reproduced,  duplicated or delivered this  Agreement  and/or any
other  documents  which may have been made  available  upon request to any other
person, except Franks's professional advisors.

     2.12 Except as specifically  stated in this Agreement,  Franks is acquiring
the Shares and the  Chancellor  Shares solely for investment for his own account
and not for the  benefit or account  of any other  person or entity,  and has no
present  agreement,  understanding,  intention or arrangement  to sell,  resell,
assign,  transfer  or  otherwise  dispose  of all or any part of the  Shares  or
Chancellor  Shares to any other person or entity  notwithstanding  any financing
arrangement  entered into by Franks to acquire the Shares or Chancellor  Shares.
Notwithstanding  any other provision of this  Agreement,  Franks shall not sell,
exchange,  transfer,  assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of all or
any part of the Shares or the Chancellor  Shares (or purport to do so) except as

                                       6
<PAGE>
permitted by applicable  securities  laws and by the Governing  Documents of the
Company and Chancellor, as the same may be amended from time to time.

     2.13 In  formulating a decision to invest in the Shares and the  Chancellor
Shares,  Franks has not relied or acted on the basis of any  representations  or
other  information,  including,  without  limitation,  any  outside  information
purported  to be given on  behalf  of the  Company,  Chancellor  or any of their
respective   affiliates,    officers,   directors,    partners,   employees   or
representatives  (it being  understood that no person has been authorized by the
Company or Chancellor to furnish any representations or other information).

     2.14 Franks has, or has been  given,  access to or has been  furnished  all
information  regarding the Company and Chancellor and their proposed  businesses
that  Franks  desires to receive or review in order to  evaluate  the merits and
risks of  investing in the Shares and  Chancellor  Shares and has been given the
opportunity  to ask  questions  of, and receive  answers  from,  the Company and
Chancellor and its representatives concerning the terms of the investment in the
Shares and Chancellor Shares.

     2.15 With  respect to any  financial  projections  or  estimates  regarding
possible  future  operations  of the Company  and/or  Chancellor  that have been
furnished to Franks, Franks is aware and understands that:

     (a) the Company is a "start-up" and has no financial or operating history;

     (b) such projections and estimates were developed using certain assumptions
for which the Company,  Chancellor or their respective  representatives believed
they had a reasonable basis at the time of preparation;

     (c) such  projections and estimates,  and the underlying  assumptions,  are
inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies, many of which
are beyond the  Company's,  Chancellor's  or their  respective  representatives'
control, and therefore actual results are likely to vary considerably from those
projected or estimated;

     (d)  such  projections  and  estimates  were  not  prepared  with a view to
compliance  with  published  guidelines  of the American  Institute of Certified
Public Accountants  regarding  forecasts or with generally  accepted  accounting
principles; and

     (e) such  projections  and estimates  have not been reviewed by independent
accountants.

     2.16 Franks is aware and understands  that there are  substantial  risks of
loss of  investment  incidental  to the  purchase  of the Shares and  Chancellor
Shares,  including  those  summarized  in this  Agreement  and,  with respect to
Chancellor,  those in Chancellor's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission.

as of the Closing  Date,  Chancellor  has all  corporate  power and authority to
execute and deliver this  Agreement  and to perform its  obligations  under this
Agreement.

     Chancellor  hereby further  represents  and warrants  solely to the Company
that, as of the Closing Date:

     3.1 Chancellor is aware and understands  that: (i) the Shares have not been
registered  under the U.S.  Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  "Securities
Act" or the "Act"),  the securities  laws of any state or the securities laws of
any  other  jurisdiction,  nor is such  registration  contemplated;  and (ii) no
governmental  or regulatory  agency has passed upon or will pass upon the Shares
or has made or will make any  finding or  determination  as to the  fairness  of
investment in the Shares.

     3.2 Chancellor is aware and  understands  that the issuance and sale of the
Shares are  intended to be exempt from  registration  under the Act by virtue of
Section 4(2) of the Act and/or the  provisions  of the  regulations  promulgated
thereunder. In particular, Chancellor is aware and understands that:

     (a)  Chancellor  must bear the economic risk of an investment in the Shares
for an  indefinite  period of time because,  among other things,  (A) the Shares
have not been  registered  under the Act and,  therefore,  cannot be sold unless
they  are  subsequently  registered  under  the Act or an  exemption  from  such
registration  is  available,  (B) the  Shares  have  not been  registered  under
applicable state securities laws and, therefore,  cannot be sold unless they are
registered  under  applicable  state  securities  laws or an exemption from such
registration  is available,  and (C) there are  substantial  restrictions on the
transferability  of the Shares under the Governing  Documents of the Company and
applicable law;

     (b) there is no established  market for the Shares and no market (public or
otherwise) for the Shares will develop in the foreseeable future, if ever;

     (c) Chancellor and the other  stockholders in the Company have no rights to

various  states,  and  Chancellor  will  not be  able  to  avail  itself  of the
provisions of Rule 144 adopted by the Securities and Exchange  Commission  under
the Act; and

     (d) the  Company  will  rely  upon an  exemption  from  registration  which
requires each investor in the Company to be an "accredited investor" (as defined
in Rule  501(a)  of  Regulation  D  promulgated  under the Act,  an  "Accredited
Investor").

     3.3 Chancellor is an Accredited  Investor within the meaning of Rule 501(a)
of Regulation D promulgated under the Act.

     3.4 Chancellor has been advised and understands  that its investment in the
Shares is illiquid and involves a high degree of risk. Chancellor is solvent and
not under  receivership,  has not become  subject to  bankruptcy  or any similar
proceeding,  has no need for  liquidity  in its  investment  in the Shares,  has
adequate means of providing for its current liabilities or other  contingencies,

<PAGE>
has the ability to bear the economic risk of its investment in the Shares and at
the present time and in the foreseeable future can afford a complete loss of its
investment in the Shares.  There are no actions,  suits or proceedings  pending,
or, to the knowledge of Chancellor,  threatened against or affecting  Chancellor
or the  assets of  Chancellor  in any  court or  before or by any U.S.  federal,
state, municipal, foreign or other governmental department,  commission,  board,
bureau, agency or instrumentality  which, if adversely determined,  would impair
the ability of Chancellor  to perform its  obligations  under this  Agreement as
provided  herein.  Chancellor  has the  capacity to protect its own  interest in
purchasing the Shares and has determined that the Shares are suitable for it.

     3.5 Chancellor has been furnished  with, and has read,  understands  and is
fully familiar with, this Agreement and the Governing  Documents of the Company,
has  received no general  solicitation  or  advertisements  and has  attended no
public seminar or other public  promotional  meeting  relating to investments in
the Shares. No representations or warranties have been made to Chancellor by the
Company  or  any  partner,  member,  officer,   employee,  agent,  affiliate  or
subsidiary  of it,  other  than  the  representations  of the  Company  in  this
Agreement.

     3.6  Except  as  specifically  stated  in  this  Agreement,  Chancellor  is
acquiring the Shares solely for  investment  for its own account and not for the
benefit or account of any other person or entity,  and has no present agreement,
understanding,  intention or arrangement to sell,  resell,  assign,  transfer or
otherwise dispose of all or any part of the Shares to any other person or entity
notwithstanding any financing  arrangement entered into by Chancellor to acquire
the Shares.  Notwithstanding  any other provision of this Agreement,  Chancellor
shall not sell, exchange,  transfer,  assign,  pledge,  hypothecate or otherwise
dispose  of all or any  part of the  Shares  (or  purport  to do so)  except  as
permitted by applicable  securities  laws and by the Governing  Documents of the
Company, as the same may be amended from time to time.

     3.7 Chancellor has, or has been given,  access to or has been furnished all
information  regarding  the Company and its proposed  business  that  Chancellor
desires  to  receive  or review in order to  evaluate  the  merits  and risks of
purchasing  the Shares and has been given the  opportunity  to ask questions of,
and receive  answers from,  the Company and its  representatives  concerning the
terms of purchasing the Shares.

     3.8 With  respect  to any  financial  projections  or  estimates  regarding
possible  future   operations  of  the  Company  that  have  been  furnished  to
Chancellor, Chancellor is aware and understands that:

     (a) the Company is a "start-up" and has no financial or operating history;

     (b) such projections and estimates were developed using certain assumptions
for which the  Company or its  respective  representatives  believed  they had a
reasonable basis at the time of preparation;

     (c) such  projections and estimates,  and the underlying  assumptions,  are
inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies, many of which
are beyond the Company's or its  representatives'  control, and therefore actual
results are likely to vary considerably from those projected or estimated;

                                       9
<PAGE>
     (d)  such  projections  and  estimates  were  not  prepared  with a view to
compliance  with  published  guidelines  of the American  Institute of Certified
Public Accountants  regarding  forecasts or with generally  accepted  accounting
principles; and

     (e) such  projections  and estimates  have not been reviewed by independent
accountants.

     3.9 Chancellor is aware and understands that there are substantial risks of
loss  incidental to the purchase of the Shares,  including  those  summarized in
this Agreement.
