Dov
Amir and Daleco
Resources Corporation

 

July
12, 2011

 

The following
sets out the
terms of the
settlement of various obligations between Daleco Resources
Corporation (“Company”) and Dov Amir
(“Amir”), which settlement was approved by the Board of Directors of
the Company on July 11, 2011.

 

Background:

 

In October 2006, Mr. Amir and the Company
entered into a Separation Agreement providing for Mr.
Amir to receive $100,000 annually for three years (“Term”),
$50,000 of which will
be deemed salary with the remaining $50,000 reducing the debt owed to Mr. Amir
(“Amir Debt”). Should the Amir Debt not be satisfied after the expiration
of the Term, the Company shall continue the $100,000 annual payment, all of which shall be allocated
to the payment of the Amir Debt until the Amir Debt is
fully satisfied. The Company reserves the right to prepay the outstanding Amir
Debt in full at any time. Upon satisfaction of the Amir Debt in full, all payments
to Amir under the Separation Agreement will cease.
The Company has not made certain payments required by the Separation Agreement applicable
to the Amir Debt. Also, pursuant to the Separation Agreement, the Company was
to satisfy the loan from First Citizens Bank to the Company or provide sufficient
substitute collateral for the bank so that the Amir Assets were
released. The Company has not been able to accomplish either of these and the
Amir Assets have not been released by the bank. The Amir
Debt is summarized below.

 

The Company has been making monthly
payments to First Citizens Bank of principal
of $1,250 and interest. The balance of
the Note at September 30, 2010
was $45,661. The loan is secured
by certain personal assets of Dov Amir.

 

On December
21, 2009, the Board of Directors granted an option to purchase 500,000 shares
of Common Stock to Amir. The option is exercisable
through December 20, 2014 at an exercise price of $0.21 per share.
The options vest 50% in December
2010 and 25% in each of December 2011 and 2012.

sum of Three Hundred One Thousand One Hundred Fifty Four Dollars ($391,154),
with interest on the unpaid principal balance computed from the date of this Note (“Note”)

 and compounded annually. Prior to demand, the
principal sum and  all accrued interest shall
be payable by Maker to Payee as set forth in that certain Settlement Agreement dated July 12, 2011,
which document is incorporated herein for all purposes (“Agreement”).

 

This
Note may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time without penalty. Any such payment or prepayment on this Note
shall be applied, first, to the  payment
of any accrued and  unpaid interest as of the date of receipt and, then, to the
outstanding principal balance. In all events, this Note shall be paid in full no later than December 31, 2015.

 

All payments and
prepayments, if any, under this Note shall be made to Payee at the foregoing address
in Beverly Hills, California, and  shall be deemed received by
Payee as of the first date that such payment is
immediately available to Payee in Beverly Hills, California, in collected federal
funds.

 

If
Maker is in default in paying when due any installment of interest or principal
on this Note, and if any such default is  not
corrected within five business days after written notice of such default is delivered to Maker at the 
address specified below, by either telephone facsimile
transmission  or messenger delivery service, then this Note shall,
at the  option of Payee, bear interest thereafter at the rate of 10.0%
per annum until this Note is paid
in full, and the entire principal of this Note then
remaining unpaid, together with all accrued interest, shall, at
said  holder's option, be
immediately due and payable without any further notice or demand.

 

Except as expressly
required by the preceding paragraph  of  this
Note,  Maker hereby waives presentment, demand, notice, protest, and all other demands
and notices in connection with  the  delivery,
 acceptance or default of this Note. 
All persons now or hereafter liable for the payment of the  principal or interest
due on this Note, or any part thereof, agree 
that the time for the payment or payments of any part of this Note may be extended
without releasing or otherwise affecting their liability on this  Note.

placed in an attorney's hands for collection, or
collected by a suit or through a
bankruptcy or any other court, either before or after 
maturity, or legal advice is sought in connection with any  event of default,
then in any of such event, Maker shall be obligated to pay to the holder of this Note
reasonable attorney's fees and all costs
and other expenses incurred in enforcing the terms

APPROPRIATE ACTION INSTITUTED BY PAYEE OR ANY HOLDER OF THIS NOTE, AND TO 
CONFESS JUDGMENT IN SUCH  ACTION
AGAINST MAKER FOR ALL SUMS DUE BY
MAKER HEREUNDER TOGETHER WITH COSTS OF SUIT AND AN AITORNEY'S FEE OF FIVE PERCENT  (5%)
OF THE UNPAID PRINCIPAL AMOUNT HEREOF. THE
WARRANT HEREIN GRANTED TO CONFESS JUDGMENT

EXERCISE THEREOF, BUT SHALL CONTINUE FROM TIME TO TIME AND
AT ALL TIMES UNTIL FULL PAYMENT
OF ALL AMOUNTS DUE HEREUNDER. FOR THESE PURPOSES, THIS  NOTE OR A COPY HEREOF
VERIFIED BY AFFIDAVIT SHALL BE SUFFICIENT WARRANT.

 

Maker hereby waives
the right of inquisition and all benefit that might accrue to Maker by

attachment, levy or sale under execution,
providing for any stay of execution, appraisement, exemption from civil process or extension of
time, and agrees that such property may be sold  to satisfy any judgment entered
on this Note, in whole or in part and in any
order  as may be desired by Payee.

 

Maker (i) acknowledges
that this Note  is a “cognovit” promissory note, which means that,
if Maker does not timely pay to Payee all of the principal
plus interest of this Note when due,  then
Payee shall be entitled, pursuant to the foregoing paragraphs of this Note,  to
obtain an immediate judgment against Maker for all 
amounts owed to  Payee under this Note, without Maker being given any additional
notice that Payee  is so doing, and  that
Payee shall be entitled, immediately upon  obtaining such judgment, 
to commence execution upon the assets of Maker in order to obtain payment in
full of the amount of such judgment; (ii) acknowledges further that Payee would not
have loaned the  principal sum of this Note to
Maker if Maker had  not agreed to
execute and deliver to Payee a “cognovit” promissory note; and (iii) represents and warrants to, and 
covenants with,  Payee, as an inducement to Payee to loan 
the principal sum of this Note to Maker, that
(A) the principal sum of this Note is being borrowed by Maker  solely for 
business purposes, (B) Maker does not claim and shall not assert or claim in
the future any  right whatsoever to offset any 
amount against any payment to become due under this Note, and (C)
Maker, to its best knowledge and belief, understands that the provisions of the
foregoing  paragraphs of this Note, relating to Payee’s rights to obtain an immediate
judgment against Maker, are  fully enforceable against Maker under the laws and in the
courts of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

 

This instrument
shall be construed according to and governed by the substantive laws 
of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania without
regard to conflict of law principles, and any judgment entered hereon should
be given full faith and credit in  any state in
which Payee may seek  to enforce
such judgment. Application of such terms or provision to persons or circumstances
other than those as to which it is held invalid or unenforceable, shall not be affected
thereby, and each term and provision of
this Note shall be valid and enforced to
the fullest extent permitted by law.
