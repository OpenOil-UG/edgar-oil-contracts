The right is granted to Lender, at his discretion, to file one or more financing statements under the Uniform Commercial Code of the Commonwealth of Kentucky naming Debtor as debtor and Lender as secured party, and indicating in the statement the types or describing the items of security specified in this agreement. Without the prior written consent of Lender, Debtor shall not file or authorize or permit to be filed in any jurisdiction any such financing or like statement in which Lender is not named as the sole secured party.
