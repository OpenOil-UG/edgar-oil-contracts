(iv)  continuation, during the Severance Term, of the health benefits provided to Employee and his covered dependents under the Companys health plans, it being understood and agreed that the Companys obligation to provide such continuation of benefits shall terminate prior to the expiration of the Severance Term in the event that Employee becomes eligible to receive any health benefits while employed by or providing service to, in any capacity, any other business or entity during the Severance Term; provided, however, that as a condition of the Companys providing the continuation of health benefits described herein, the Company may require Employee to elect continuation coverage under COBRA. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such health benefits are provided to employees of the Company generally through a self-insured arrangement, and Employee qualifies as a highly compensated individual (within the meaning of Section 105(h) of the Code), such continuation of benefits

shall be provided on a fully taxable basis, based on 100% of the monthly premium cost of participation in the self-insured plan less any portion required to be paid by Employee (the Taxable Cost), and, as such, Employees W-2 shall include the after-tax value of the Taxable Cost for each month during the applicable benefit continuation period.

During such twenty (20) day notice period, the Company shall have a cure right (if curable), and if not cured within such period, Employees termination will be effective upon the expiration of such cure period, and Employee shall be entitled to the same payments and benefits as provided in Section 8(d) above for a termination by the Company without Cause, subject to the same conditions on payment and benefits as described in Section 8(d) above.
 
Following such termination of Employees employment by Employee with Good Reason, except as set forth in this Section 8(e), Employee shall have no further rights to any compensation or any other benefits under this Agreement, and any previously awarded Membership Interests which are not vested as of the date of termination shall be cancelled.

Date, a general release in favor of the Company Group in such form as is acceptable to the Board, in its sole discretion, and any waiting or revocation periods contained in such release shall have expired. The Company shall deliver such release to Employee within ten (10) business days following the termination of Employees employment hereunder, and the Companys failure to deliver such release prior to the expiration of such ten (10) business day period shall constitute a waiver of any requirement to execute such release.
 
Section 9.                                          Noncompetition and Nonsolicitation.  In consideration of the Companys employment of the Employee pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, so as to protect the Companys legitimate business interests (including the goodwill with which Employee will be associated), Employee agrees that while employed or otherwise engaged by the Company or any member of the Company Group, and thereafter for a period of eighteen (18) months immediately following the termination of Employees employment for whatever reason, Employee will not, directly or indirectly:
 
(a)         carry on or engage in Competitive Duties (as a director, employee, consultant or otherwise) within the Restricted Area for any Competing Business;
 
(b)         solicit (or assist another in soliciting) any Covered Client or Prospective Client for the purpose of inducing, or attempting to induce, such Covered Client or Prospective Client to cease or reduce its business with any member of the Company Group, or not to do business with the Company or any member of the Company Group; or
 
(c)          (i) encourage (or assist another in encouraging) any employee, contractor, consultant, supplier, or vendor of the Company or any member of the Company Group to terminate his, her or its relationship with the Company or any member of the Company Group, or (ii) on behalf of a Competing Business, engage, employ, or solicit or contact for employment or engagement (or assist another in such activity) any employee, contractor or consultant of the Company or any member of the Company Group or any person who was an employee, contractor, or consultant of the Company or any member of the Company Group at any time during the last twelve (12) months of Employees employment with the Company (or, if Employee is employed by the Company for less than twelve (12) months, those persons who were employees, contractors, or consultants of the Company or any member of the Company Group during Employees employment with the Company).
 
(d)         Value and Reasonableness.  Employee acknowledges and agrees that the Companys substantial investments in its business interests, goodwill, and Confidential Information are worthy of protection, and that the Companys need for the protection afforded by this Section 5 is greater than any hardship Employee might experience by complying with its terms. Employee further acknowledges and agrees that the restrictions set forth herein are based upon good consideration and do not place an unreasonable burden upon Employee or the public.  Employee also acknowledges and agrees that Employee constitutes executive and/or management personnel of the Company and that the limitations as to time, geographic area, and scope of activity to be restrained contained in this Agreement are reasonable and are not greater than necessary to protect the trade secrets and other Confidential Information, goodwill and other legitimate business interests of the Company.
 
(e)          Reformation Requested.  Although the Company and Employee believe the limitations as to time, geographic area, and scope of activity contained in this Section 5 are reasonable and do not impose a greater restraint than necessary to protect the Companys Confidential Information and legitimate business interests, if this is judicially determined not to be the case, the Company and
 
10






 
Employee specifically request that the limitations contained in this Agreement be reformed to the extent necessary to make this Agreement enforceable.
 
(f)           Non-Disparagement.  Employee further agrees that he will not disparage or comment negatively about the Company, any member of the Company Group, or their officers and management, and/or current or former employees.
 
(g)          Acknowledgments.  Employee acknowledges and agrees that Employee will serve the Company as an officer and in an executive and management position pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes § 8-2-113(2)(d).  Employee further acknowledges and agrees that, given the significant contacts that both the Company and Employee have to Colorado (which will be the location where the majority of Employees duties for the Company will be performed), Colorado law shall govern all aspects of Section 9 of this Agreement.
 
Section 10.                                   Representations and Warranties of Employee.  Employee represents and warrants to the Company that:
 
(a)         Employee is entering into this Agreement voluntarily and that his employment hereunder and compliance with the terms and conditions hereof will not conflict with or result in the breach by him of any agreement to which he is a party or by which he may be bound;
 
(b)         Employee has not violated, and in connection with his employment with the Company will not violate, any non-solicitation, non-competition, or other similar covenant or agreement of a prior employer by which he is or may be bound; and
 
(c)          in connection with his employment with the Company, Employee will not use any confidential or proprietary information he may have obtained in connection with employment with any prior employer.
 
Section 11.                                   Taxes.  The Company may withhold from any payments made under this Agreement all applicable taxes, including but not limited to income, employment, and social security taxes, as shall be required by applicable law. Employee acknowledges and represents that the Company has not provided any tax advice to him in connection with this Agreement and that he has been advised by the Company to seek tax advice from his own tax advisors regarding this Agreement and payments that may be made to him pursuant to this Agreement, including specifically, the application of the provisions of Section 409A of the Code to such payments.
 
Section 12.                                   Set Off; Mitigation.  The Companys obligation to pay Employee the amounts and to make the arrangements provided hereunder shall be subject to set-off, counterclaim, or recoupment of amounts owed by Employee to the Company or its affiliates; provided, however, that to the extent any amount so subject to set-off, counterclaim, or recoupment is payable in installments hereunder, such set-off, counterclaim, or recoupment shall not modify the applicable payment date of any installment, and to the extent an obligation cannot be satisfied by reduction of a single installment payment, any portion not satisfied shall remain an outstanding obligation of Employee and shall be applied to the next installment only at such time the installment is otherwise payable pursuant to the specified payment schedule. Employee shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for pursuant to this Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise, and except as provided in Section 8 hereof regarding health benefits, the amount of any payment provided for pursuant to this Agreement shall not be reduced by any compensation earned as a result of Employees other employment or otherwise.

Section 13.                                   Successors and Assigns; No Third-Party Beneficiaries.
 
(a)         The Company. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the Company and its respective successors and assigns. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, obligations, or interests arising hereunder may be assigned by the Company to a Person (other than another member of the Company Group, or its or their respective successors) without Employees prior written consent; provided, however, that in the event of the merger or consolidation, or transfer or sale of all or substantially all of the assets, of the Company with or to any other individual or entity, this Agreement shall, subject to the provisions hereof, be binding upon and inure to the benefit of such successor, and such successor shall discharge and perform all the promises, covenants, duties, and obligations of the Company hereunder, it being agreed that in such circumstances, the consent of Employee shall not be required in connection therewith.
 
(b)         Employee. Employees rights and obligations under this Agreement shall not be transferable by Employee by assignment or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the Company; provided, however, that if Employee shall die, all amounts then payable to Employee hereunder shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to Employees devisee, legatee, or other designee, or if there be no such designee, to Employees estate.
 
(c)          No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as otherwise set forth in Section 8(b) hereof, nothing expressed or referred to in this Agreement will be construed to give any Person other than the Company, the other members of the Company Group, and Employee any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim under or with respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement.
 
Section 14.                                   Waiver and Amendments.  Any waiver, alteration, amendment, or modification of any of the terms of this Agreement shall be valid only if made in writing and signed by each of the parties hereto; provided, however, that any such waiver, alteration, amendment, or modification is consented to on the Companys behalf by the Board. No waiver by either of the parties hereto of their rights hereunder shall be deemed to constitute a waiver with respect to any subsequent occurrences or transactions hereunder unless such waiver specifically states that it is to be construed as a continuing waiver.
 
Section 15.                                   Severability.  If any covenants or such other provisions of this Agreement are found to be invalid or unenforceable by a final determination of a court of competent jurisdiction, (a) the remaining terms and provisions hereof shall be unimpaired, and (b) the invalid or unenforceable term or provision hereof shall be deemed replaced by a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision hereof.
 
Section 16.                                   Governing Law, Venue, and Jurisdiction.  In the event of any dispute arising from or related to this Agreement or the employment relationship between the Company and Employee (a Dispute), such Dispute and this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Colorado, without regard to its conflicts of law provisions.  Any Dispute shall be resolved exclusively in the Colorado state or federal courts.  The Company and Employee hereby irrevocably agree to submit to the jurisdiction of such courts.  Each party shall bear its own costs, including attorneys fees, subject to the following: nothing provided herein shall interfere with either partys right to seek or receive damages or costs as may be allowed by applicable statutory law (such as, but not necessarily limited to, reasonable attorneys fees and dispute resolution related costs and expenses, if allowed by applicable statutory law).

Section 17.                                   Notices.
 
(a)         Every notice or other communication relating to this Agreement shall be in writing, and shall be mailed to or delivered to the party for whom or which it is intended at such address as may from time to time be designated by it in a notice mailed or delivered to the other party as herein provided; provided, that unless and until some other address be so designated, all notices and communications by Employee to the Company shall be mailed or delivered to the Company at its principal executive office, and all notices and communications by the Company to Employee may be given to Employee personally or may be mailed to Employee at Employees last known address, as reflected in the Companys records.
 
(b)         Any notice so addressed shall be deemed to be given (i) if delivered by hand, on the date of such delivery, (ii) if mailed by courier or by overnight mail, on the first business day following the date of such mailing, and (iii) if mailed by registered or certified mail, on the third business day after the date of such mailing.
 
Section 18.                                   Section Headings; Mutual Drafting.
 
(a)         The headings of the sections and subsections of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed to constitute a part thereof or affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or of any term or provision hereof.
 
(b)         The parties are sophisticated and have been represented (or have had the opportunity to be represented) by their separate attorneys throughout the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in connection with the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and any agreements and instruments executed in connection herewith. As a consequence, the parties do not intend that the presumptions of laws or rules relating to the interpretation of contracts against the drafter of any particular clause should be applied to this Agreement or any document or instrument executed in connection herewith, and therefore waive their effects.
 
Section 19.                                   Entire Agreement.  This Agreement, together with any exhibits attached hereto, constitutes the entire understanding and agreement of the parties hereto regarding the employment of Employee. This Agreement supersedes all prior negotiations, discussions, correspondence, communications, understandings, and agreements between the parties relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.
 
Section 20.                                   Survival of Operative Sections.  Upon any termination of Employees employment, this Agreement shall survive to the extent necessary to give effect to the provisions thereof.
 
Section 21.                                   Section 409A.  The intent of the parties is that payments and benefits under this Agreement comply with Section 409A of the Code, to the extent subject thereto, and accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, this Agreement shall be interpreted and administered to be in compliance therewith. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Employee shall not be considered to have terminated employment with the Company for purposes of this Agreement unless Employee would be considered to have incurred a separation from service from the Company within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. Each amount to be paid or benefit to be provided under this Agreement shall be construed as a separate identified payment for purposes of Section 409A of the Code, and any payments described in this Agreement that are due within the short term deferral period as defined in Section 409A of the Code shall not be treated as deferred compensation unless applicable law requires otherwise. Without limiting the foregoing and notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,

to the extent required in order to avoid accelerated taxation and/or tax penalties under Section 409A of the Code, amounts that would otherwise be payable and benefits that would otherwise be provided pursuant to this Agreement during the six-month period immediately following Employees separation from service shall instead be paid on the first business day after the date that is six months following Employees separation from service (or death, if earlier). To the extent required to avoid an accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, amounts reimbursable to Employee under this Agreement shall be paid to Employee on or before the last day of the year following the year in which the expense was incurred and the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement (and in-kind benefits provided to Employee) during any one year may not effect amounts reimbursable or provided in any subsequent year. The Agreement may be amended in any respect deemed by the Board or the Board to be necessary in order to preserve compliance with Section 409A of the Code.
 
Section 22.                                   Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. The execution of this Agreement may be by actual, facsimile, or pdf. signature.
