        WHEREAS,
the parties intend that for United States federal income tax purposes the Contribution and the Distribution, taken together, will qualify as a tax-free

        WHEREAS,
the parties entered into the Tax Sharing Agreement to (a) provide for the payment of Tax Liabilities and entitlement to refunds thereof, allocate responsibility for, and

tax-free status of the Contribution and the Distribution under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code; 

        WHEREAS,
the parties have agreed to amend Section 6.2(b) of the Tax Sharing Agreement, which sets forth certain covenants relating to the preservation of the tax-free
status of the Contribution and the Distribution under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, in a manner intended to preserve the tax-free status of the Contribution and the
Distribution under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. 

        NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and undertakings contained herein, the parties agree as follows:

issue any capital stock or other equity interests, options, or rights to acquire capital stock or other equity interests, or any other instruments convertible into or exchangeable
for, or that could otherwise result in the issuance of, capital stock or other equity interests (collectively, "Capital Stock");  provided, however, that, after the Distribution, Lone Pine may issue up to an aggregate of 10% of the
amount of its Capital Stock outstanding immediately after the IPO pursuant to the Lone Pine Resources Inc. 2011 Stock Incentive Plan and pursuant to the Lone Pine Resources Inc. 2012

information relating solely to the business or affairs of such party) concerning the other parties hereto furnished to it by such other party or its representatives pursuant to this Amendment (except
to the extent that such information can be shown to have been (i) in the public domain through no fault of such party, (ii) later lawfully acquired from other sources not known to be
