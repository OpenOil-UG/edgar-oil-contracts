B.            The Borrower has requested and the Majority Lenders have agreed to amend certain provisions of the Credit Agreement as set forth herein.
 
C.            Now, therefore, to induce the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to enter into this Second Amendment and in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants herein contained, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

2.2           Amendment to Section 8.11(a).  Section 8.11(a) is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:
 
(a)         On or before March 15 of each year, commencing March 15, 2013, the Borrower shall furnish to the Administrative Agent a Reserve Report evaluating the Oil and Gas Properties of the Borrower and its Domestic Subsidiaries as of the immediately preceding December 31st located within the geographic boundaries of the United States of America (or the Outer Continental Shelf adjacent to the United States of America). The Reserve Report as of December 31st of each year shall be reviewed by one or more Approved Petroleum Engineers.
 
Section 3.               Conditions Precedent.  This Second Amendment shall become effective on the date (such date, the Second Amendment Effective Date), when each of the following conditions is satisfied (or waived in accordance with Section 12.02):
 
3.1           The Administrative Agent shall have received from the Majority Lenders and the Borrower, counterparts (in such number as may be requested by the Administrative Agent) of this Second Amendment signed on behalf of such Person.

Section 4.               Miscellaneous.
 
4.1           Confirmation. The provisions of the Credit Agreement, as amended by this Second Amendment, shall remain in full force and effect following the effectiveness of this Second Amendment.
 
4.2           Ratification and Affirmation; Representations and Warranties.  The Borrower hereby (a) ratifies and affirms its obligations under, and acknowledges its continued liability under, each Loan Document to which it is a party and agrees that each Loan Document to which it is a party remains in full force and effect as expressly amended hereby and (b) represents and warrants to the Lenders that as of the date hereof, after giving effect to the terms of this Second Amendment:

(ii)           no event or events have occurred which individually or in the aggregate could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
4.3           Counterparts. This Second Amendment may be executed by one or more of the parties hereto in any number of separate counterparts, and all of such counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument.  Delivery of this Second Amendment by facsimile transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart hereof.
 
4.4           NO ORAL AGREEMENT.

Any provision of this Second Amendment which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.
 
4.8           Successors and Assigns. This Second Amendment shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.
