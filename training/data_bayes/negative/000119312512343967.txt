protect its rights in such Inventions or Improvements. In the event Licensee declines to file any patent application with respect to any Inventions or Improvements, it will notify Syntroleum within thirty (30) days of its decision not to file
such application and will allow Syntroleum, at its sole discretion, to file such patent application at its sole expense and to take such other steps as are necessary, in Syntroleums sole judgment, to protect any patent rights in such
Inventions or Improvements. Subject to Licensees obligation to account to any third parties pertaining to the patentable Inventions or Improvements, if Syntroleum elects to pursue such patent application, Licensee will assign to Syntroleum all
of Licensees right, title and interest in and to the patentable Inventions or Improvements.

to such patent application assigned to Syntroleum.

   8 








 
(i)
promptly undertake at its own expense the defense of the claim or lawsuit; and 
 


 
(ii)
hold Syntroleum, its Affiliates, and their officers, directors, and employees harmless from any Loss arising out of the claim or lawsuit. 
 


 
(b)
If the design, construction and/or operation of the Licensed Plant which is the basis for alleged infringement or misappropriation, is (i) in accordance with the
designs, specifications and operating conditions (including, but not limited to, catalysts) embodied in the Process Design Package for the Licensed Plant, or (ii) as otherwise subsequently approved by Syntroleum in writing, Syntroleum will
subject to limitation of liability set forth in Section 8.08 of this Agreement:   


 
(i)
promptly undertake at its own expense the defense of the claim or lawsuit; and 
 


 
(ii)
hold Licensee, its Affiliates, and their officers, directors, and employees harmless from any Loss arising out of the claim or lawsuit.

such Party will have the right to be represented therein by advisory counsel of its selection and at its expense.   


 
(d)
In the event a court or other tribunal finds that infringement and/or misappropriation has occurred not as a result of Licensees modifications, Syntroleum will
have the option, at its sole expense but subject to the limitation of liability set forth in Section 8.08 of this Agreement, to either:   


 
(i)
provide designs, specifications and/or operating conditions (including, but not limited to, catalysts) and make modifications to the Licensed Plant which avoid such
infringement and/or misappropriation without degrading the economics or performance of the Licensed Plant; or   


 
(ii)
acquire the right to continue using the design, construction and operating conditions (including, but not limited to, catalysts), which were the subject of such
infringement and/or misappropriation and obtain a full and unconditional release of Licensee with respect to any claims of infringement and/or misappropriation by Licensee. 
   9 








 
(e)
Except as provided in section 8.05(d)(ii), a Party will not settle or compromise any claim or lawsuit alleging infringement or misappropriation without the written

settlement or compromise.   


8.06
Except for patent infringement claims by a third party, Syntroleum subject to the limitation of liability set forth in Section 8.08 of this Agreement agrees to
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Licensee, its Affiliates, and their officers, directors, and employees from and against any Loss arising out of the following:

and employees from and against any Loss arising out of:   


 
(a)
Licensees construction, operation and maintenance of the Licensed Plant in a manner inconsistent in any material respect with the Process Design Package; or
  


 
(b)
any property (real or personal) damage, personal injury or death caused by Licensee or its representatives.

8.09
IN THE EVENT THAT AN UPFRONT ROYALTY IS NOT TIMELY PAID TO SYNTROLEUM WHEN DUE, IN ADDITON TO ANY CLAIM FOR DAMAGES AGAINST LICENSEE, SYNTROLEUM SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO
IMMEDIATELY TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT BY GIVING WRITTEN NOTICE TO LICENSEE. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THE PREVIOUS SENTENCE, SYNTROLEUMS SOLE REMEDY FOR BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT BY LICENSEE IS MONEY DAMAGES.

this Agreement, to the extent that performing such obligations, or any of them, is delayed or prevented by Force Majeure. Each Party will do all things reasonably possible to remove the cause of such default. Notwithstanding the above, if any Force
Majeure event prevents a Party from performing all or substantially all of its obligations under this Agreement and continues for more than three (3) years, either Party may terminate their rights and obligations under this Agreement by written
notice to the other. Such termination will not relieve any Party from obligations undertaken and due before such termination or otherwise under this Agreement. 
 


11.04 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, if Licensee fails to take any action contemplated by this Agreement within the period of time
specified in this Agreement due to Excusable Delay, then such period of time shall be extended by an amount of time equal to the period of such Excusable Delay.  12.  Miscellaneous 
 


12.01 
This Agreement embodies the entire intent of the Parties and merges all prior oral and written agreements between the Parties hereto with respect to subject matter
hereof. No stipulation, agreement, representation or understanding of the Parties hereto will be valid or enforceable unless contained in this Agreement or in a subsequent written agreement signed by the Parties hereto. 
   14 









12.02 
This Agreement shall be governed by, and shall be enforced, construed and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York (without giving effect to
any principle of conflict of laws that would result in the application of the law of another jurisdiction as the governing law of this Agreement), which shall be deemed to be the proper law of this Agreement. For any matter (i) seeking
equitable relief that is not available in arbitration, (ii) to enforce an arbitration award under Section 12.03, or (iii) for any other matter the parties mutually agree not to submit to arbitration under Section 12.03, the
Parties agree that the jurisdiction governing any such disputes or interpretation of matters arising from the Agreement is the State of New York, in New York County. Any action or proceeding which is permitted to be brought by a Party against a
Party to this Agreement pursuant to this Section 12.02, whether in tort or contract or at law or in equity, shall be brought in a federal court in the State of New York, in New York County or, if federal court shall not have jurisdiction, state
court in the State of New York, in New York County and each Party: (a) irrevocably submits to the personal jurisdiction of such courts; (b) waives any objection to laying venue in any such action or proceeding in such courts;
(c) waives any objection that such courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over it; and (d) agrees that service of process upon it may be effected by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified mail (or any
substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to it at its address specified in the heading of this Agreement or as specified below. The foregoing consents to jurisdiction and service of process shall not constitute general consents to
service of process in the State of New York for any purpose except as provided herein and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any person other than the parties to the Agreement. Each Party shall appoint an agent for service in New York County
for service of process in any dispute arising out of or relating to the Agreement and agrees that service upon such agent shall constitute personal service upon each such Party. 
 


12.03 
The Parties agree that in the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim between the Parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the alleged breach of
this Agreement (expressly including the validity, scope, and enforceability of this arbitration agreement), the Controller of Licensee and the President of Syntroleum shall confer. If they fail within fifteen (15) days to agree on a
satisfactory resolution, then the Parties agree that any such dispute, controversy, claim or alleged breach shall be settled by final and binding arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association
(the AAA), and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered by a United States District Court. The Parties stipulate this Agreement involves a transaction in interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act is
fully applicable. Within thirty (30) days of either Party delivering to the other party notice of arbitration under this Section 12.03, each party shall select an arbitrator. The two arbitrators selected by the parties shall, within ten
(10) days of their appointment, select as chairman of the tribunal, a third neutral arbitrator (collectively with the party-appointed arbitrators, the Arbitrators and each an Arbitrator). If the two party-appointed
Arbitrators do not agree on a third neutral Arbitrator, the third Arbitrator shall be selected by the AAA. The arbitration hearing shall be held in Houston, Texas before the three Arbitrators. Each of the Arbitrators shall be unaffiliated with
either Party or its Affiliates, shall not have any material financial dependence on either Party, and shall at all times remain neutral and wholly impartial. The arbitration hearing shall commence within twenty (20) days of the appointment of
the third Arbitrator. The arbitrators shall have no power to modify the terms of this Agreement or to award punitive damages. The Parties hereto hereby waive any rights or claims for punitive damages in arbitration. Notwithstanding the above, a
Party seeking equitable relief that is not available under arbitration will not be subject to the arbitration provisions of this Section 12.03, and such Party may bring such claim pursuant to the provisions of Section 12.02.

   15 









12.04 
This Agreement does not grant and will not be construed as granting any license, authorization or consent, to either Party by the other Party hereto, to use any name,
trademark, service mark or slogan of the other Party. Except as required by law, a Party will not use the other Partys name without written consent, except for the identification of the other Party as Syntroleum or a licensee of Syntroleum.
  


12.05 
Failure of either Syntroleum or Licensee at any time or from time to time to exercise any of its rights under this Agreement or to insist upon strict performance of the
other Partys obligations hereunder will not be deemed a waiver of or to limit any of such rights or obligations with respect to such rights or obligations or any subsequent occurrence. 
 


12.06 
The Parties may publish the existence of this Agreement but agree not to disclose, without the prior written consent of the other Party, any of the terms of this
Agreement or any portion thereof, or any amendment concerning the same, except as required by law or by the rules of any listing exchange.
