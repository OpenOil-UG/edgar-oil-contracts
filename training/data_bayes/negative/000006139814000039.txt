Section 2.3 Performance by Noteholder on Grantor’s Behalf.  Grantor agrees that, if   any Event of Default is continuing as a result of Grantor failure to perform any act or to take any   action which hereunder Grantor is required to perform or take, or to pay any money which   hereunder Grantor is required to pay, Noteholder, in Grantor’s name or its own name, may, but   shall not be obligated to, perform or cause to be performed such act or take such action or pay   such money, and any expenses so incurred by Noteholder and any money so paid by Noteholder,   shall be a demand obligation owing by Grantor to Noteholder (which obligation Grantor hereby   expressly promises to pay) and Noteholder, upon making such payment, shall be subrogated to   all of the rights of the person, corporation or body politic receiving such payment.  Each amount   due and owing by Grantor to Noteholder pursuant to this Mortgage shall bear interest each day,   from the date of such expenditure or payment until paid, at a rate equal to the rate as provided for   past-due principal under the Note (provided that, should applicable law provide for a maximum   permissible rate of interest on such amounts, such rate shall not be greater than such maximum   permissible rate); all such amounts, together with such interest thereon, shall be a part of the   secured indebtedness and shall be secured by this Mortgage.     ARTICLE III.      Assignment of Production, Accounts, and Proceeds    Section 3.1 Assignment of Production.

Grantor will direct and instruct in the event of an   Event of Default any and all purchasers of any Production to pay to Noteholder all of the   Production Proceeds accruing to Grantor’s interest until such time as such purchasers have been   furnished with evidence that all secured indebtedness has been paid and that this Mortgage has   been released.  Grantor agrees that no purchasers of the Production shall have any responsibility   for the application of any funds paid to Noteholder.     Section 3.2 Effectuating Payment of Production Proceeds to Noteholder.  Independent   of the foregoing provisions and authorities herein granted, Grantor agrees to execute and deliver   any and all transfer orders, division orders and other instruments that may be requested by   Noteholder or that may be required by any purchaser of any Production for the purpose of     

 





          12               effectuating payment of the Production Proceeds to Noteholder after an Event of Default.  If   under any existing sales agreements, other than division orders or transfer orders, any Production   Proceeds are required to be paid by the purchaser to Grantor so that under such existing   agreements payment cannot be made of such Production Proceeds to Noteholder after an Event   of Default, Grantor’s interest in all Production Proceeds under such sales agreements and in all   other Production Proceeds which for any reason may be paid to Grantor shall, when received by   Grantor after an Event of Default, constitute trust funds in Grantor’s hands and shall be   immediately paid over to Noteholder.  Without limitation upon any of the foregoing, Grantor   hereby constitutes and appoints Noteholder as Grantor’s special attorney-in-fact (with full power   of substitution, either generally or for such periods or purposes as Noteholder may from time to   time prescribe) in the name, place and stead of Grantor to do any and every act and exercise any   and every power that Grantor might or could do or exercise personally with respect to all   Production and Production Proceeds after an Event of Default (the same having been assigned by   Grantor to Noteholder pursuant to Section 3.1 hereof), expressly inclusive, but not limited to, the   right, power and authority after an Event of Default to:     (a) Execute and deliver in the name of Grantor any and all transfer orders,   division orders, letters in lieu of transfer orders, indemnifications, certificates and other   instruments of every nature that may be requested or required by any purchaser of   Production from any of the Mortgaged Properties for the purposes of effectuating   payment of the Production Proceeds to Noteholder or which Noteholder may otherwise   deem necessary or appropriate to effect the intent and purposes of the assignment   contained in Section 3.1; and     (b) If under any product sales agreements other than division orders or   transfer orders, any Production Proceeds are required to be paid by the purchaser to   Grantor so that under such existing agreements payment cannot be made of such   Production Proceeds to Noteholder, to make, execute and enter into such sales   agreements or other agreements as are necessary to direct Production Proceeds to be   payable to Noteholder;     giving and granting unto said attorney-in-fact full power and authority to do and perform any and   every act and thing whatsoever necessary and requisite to be done as fully and to all intents and   purposes, as Grantor might or could do if personally present; and Grantor shall be bound thereby   as fully and effectively as if Grantor had personally executed, acknowledged and delivered any   of the foregoing certificates or documents.  The powers and authorities herein conferred upon   Noteholder may be exercised by Noteholder after an Event of Default through any person who,   at the time of the execution of the particular instrument, is an officer of Noteholder.  The power   of attorney herein conferred is granted for valuable consideration and hence is coupled with an   interest and is irrevocable so long as the secured indebtedness, or any part thereof (other than   contingent indemnification obligations to the extent no claim giving rise thereto has been   asserted), shall remain unpaid and this Mortgage is unreleased.  All persons dealing with   Noteholder or any substitute, shall be fully protected in treating the powers and authorities   conferred by this paragraph as continuing in full force and effect until advised by Noteholder that   all the secured indebtedness is fully and finally paid and this Mortgage is released.       

 





          13               Section 3.3 Change of Purchaser.  Should any person now or hereafter purchasing or   taking Production fail to make payment promptly to Noteholder of the Production Proceeds after   an Event of Default, Noteholder shall have the right to make, or to require Grantor to make, a   change of connection and the right to designate or approve the purchaser with whose facilities a   new connection shall be made, and Noteholder shall have no liability or responsibility in   connection therewith so long as ordinary care is used in making such designation.      Section 3.4 Application of Production Proceeds.       After an Event of Default, all Production Proceeds from time to time in the hands of Noteholder   shall be applied by it toward the payment of all secured indebtedness (principal, interest,   reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys’ fees and other fees and expenses) at such times and in such   manner and order and to such extent as Noteholder deems advisable.  Any Production Proceeds   from time to time received by Noteholder after an Event of Default shall be credited to, or sent at   the direction of, Borrower.                 Section 3.5 Release From Liability; Indemnification.  Noteholder and its successors and   assigns are hereby absolved from all liability for failure to enforce collection of the Production   Proceeds and from all other responsibility in connection therewith, except the responsibility of   each to account to Grantor for funds actually received by each and for its gross negligence,   willful misconduct and fraud.  Grantor agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Noteholder (for   purposes of this paragraph, the term “Noteholder” shall include the directors, officers, partners,   employees and agents of Noteholder and any persons or entities owned or controlled by or   affiliated with Noteholder) against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, losses, damages   (including without limitation consequential damages), causes of action, judgments, penalties,   reasonable costs and expenses (including without limitation reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys’   fees and expenses) by reason of the assertion that Noteholder received, either before or after   payment in full of the secured indebtedness, funds from the production of oil, gas, other   hydrocarbons or other minerals claimed by third persons (and/or funds attributable to sales of   production which (i) were made at prices in excess of the maximum price permitted by   applicable law or (ii) were otherwise made in violation of laws, rules, regulations and/or orders   governing such sales), and Noteholder shall have the right to defend against any such claims or   actions, employing attorneys of its own selection, and if not furnished with indemnity reasonably   satisfactory to it, Noteholder shall have the right to compromise and adjust any such claims,   actions and judgments, and in addition to the rights to be indemnified as herein provided, all   amounts paid by Noteholder in compromise, satisfaction or discharge of any such claim, action   or judgment, and all court costs, reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys’ fees and other expenses of   every character expended by Noteholder pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be a   demand obligation (which obligation Grantor hereby expressly promises to pay) owing by   Grantor to Noteholder and shall bear interest, from the date expended until paid, at the rate   described in Section 2.3 hereof.  WITHOUT LIMITATION, IT IS THE INTENTION OF   GRANTOR AND GRANTOR AGREES THAT THE FOREGOING INDEMNITIES   SHALL APPLY TO EACH INDEMNIFIED PARTY WITH RESPECT TO ALL   CLAIMS, DEMANDS, LIABILITIES, LOSSES, DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT   LIMITATION CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES), CAUSES OF ACTION, JUDGMENTS,     

 





          14               PENALTIES, REASONABLE COSTS AND EXPENSES (INCLUDING WITHOUT   LIMITATION REASONABLE OUT-OF-POCKET ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND   EXPENSES) WHICH IN WHOLE OR IN PART ARE CAUSED BY OR ARISE OUT OF   THE SIMPLE NEGLIGENCE OF SUCH (AND/OR ANY OTHER) INDEMNIFIED   PARTY.  However, such indemnities shall not apply to any particular indemnified party (but   shall apply to the other indemnified parties, it being understood that Noteholder shall be   considered the same indemnified party as its directors, officers, partners, employees and agents)   to the extent the subject of the indemnification is caused by or arises out of the gross negligence,   fraud or willful misconduct of such particular indemnified party.      Section 3.5 Grantor’s Absolute Obligation to Pay Note.  Nothing herein contained   shall detract from or limit the obligations of Grantor to make prompt payment of the Note, and   any and all other secured indebtedness, at the time and in the manner provided herein and in the   Loan Documents, regardless of whether the Production and Production Proceeds herein assigned   are sufficient to pay same, and the rights under this Article III shall be cumulative of all other   rights of Noteholder under the Loan Documents.     ARTICLE IV.      Remedies Upon Default     Section 4.1 Default.  The term “Event of Default” as used in this Mortgage shall mean   the occurrence of any of the following events:     (a) the failure of Grantor to make due and punctual payment of the Note or of   any other secured indebtedness or of any installment of principal thereof or interest   thereon, or any part thereof, as the same shall become due and payable, whether at a date   for payment of a fixed installment or contingent or other payment, or as a result of   acceleration, or otherwise, and such failure is not remedied within five (5) days of written   notice of said non-payment by Noteholder; or     (b) the failure of Grantor to pay over to Noteholder any Production Proceeds   which are receivable by Noteholder under this Mortgage but which are paid to Grantor   rather than Noteholder (either as provided for in Section 3.2 hereof or otherwise), and   such failure is not remedied within 5 days after written notice and demand by Noteholder;   or     (c) the failure of Grantor timely and properly to observe, keep or perform any   covenant, agreement, warranty or condition herein or in any other Loan Document   required to be observed, kept or performed (other than covenant, agreement, warranty or   condition otherwise constituting an Event of Default hereunder or under any other Loan   Document), and such failure is not remedied within the cure or grace period provided or,   if no specific cure period is provided, then within 20 days after written notice and   demand by Noteholder; or       

 





          15               (d) any representation contained herein or in any other Loan Document shall   prove to have been false or misleading in any material respect on the date, or as of which,   made and such representation is not made true and correct (as of the time such corrective   action is taken) within the cure or grace period provided or, if no specific cure period is   provided, then within 20 days after written notice and demand by Noteholder; or     (e) [intentionally omitted]; or     (f) Grantor suffers the entry against it of a judgment, decree or order for relief   by a court of competent jurisdiction in an involuntary case commenced under any   applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law of any jurisdiction now or   hereafter in effect, including the United States Bankruptcy Code, as amended; or     (g) Grantor suffers the appointment of a receiver, liquidator, assignee,   custodian, trustee, sequestrator or similar official for a substantial part of its Property in a   proceeding brought against it and (1) such appointment is neither made ineffective nor   discharged, released, vacated or fully bonded within thirty days after the making thereof,   or (2) such appointment is consented to, requested by, or acquiesced to by Grantor; or     (h) Grantor commences an action or voluntary case under any applicable   bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law now or hereafter in effect, including the United   States Bankruptcy Code, as amended; or consents to the entry of an order for relief in an   involuntary case under any such law or to the appointment of or taking possession by a   receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official of   any substantial part of its assets or any part of the Property; or     (i) Grantor makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors or fails   generally to pay its debts as such debts become due or takes corporate or other action in   furtherance thereof or in furtherance of any proceeding described in subparagraph (h)   immediately above; or     (j) Grantor suffers a writ or warrant of attachment or any similar process to   be issued by any court against all or any substantial part of its Property, and such writ or   warrant of attachment or any similar process is not stayed, vacated, fully bonded or   released within thirty days after the entry or levy thereof; or     (k) Any of the events referred to above in subsections (c), (d), (f), (g), (h), (i)   and (j) shall occur with respect to any guarantor of the secured indebtedness and shall not   be remedied within the applicable grace period (if any) set forth in such subsections; or    (l) a “default” or “event of default” occurs under any Loan Document, other   than this Mortgage, which defines either such term and the same is not remedied within   the applicable period of cure or grace (if any) provided in such Loan Document.   Section 4.2 Acceleration of Secured Indebtedness.  Upon the occurrence of an Event   of Default described in subsection (f), (g), or (h) of section 4.1 above, all of the secured     

 





          16               indebtedness shall thereupon be immediately due and payable, without presentment, demand,   protest, notice of protest, declaration or notice of acceleration or intention to accelerate, or any   other notice or declaration of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by Grantor.    During the continuance of any other Event of Default, Noteholder at any time and from time to   time may without notice to Grantor or any other person declare any or all of the secured   indebtedness immediately due and payable and all such secured indebtedness shall thereupon be   immediately due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest, notice of protest, notice of   acceleration or of intention to accelerate or any other notice or declaration of any kind, all of   which are hereby expressly waived by Grantor, and the liens evidenced hereby shall be subject to   foreclosure in any manner provided for herein or provided for by law as Noteholder may elect.     Section 4.3 Pre-Foreclosure Remedies.  Upon the occurrence and during the   continuance of an Event of Default, Noteholder is authorized, prior or subsequent to the   institution of any foreclosure proceedings, to enter upon the Property, or any part thereof, and to   take possession of the Property and all books and records relating thereto, and to exercise   without interference from Grantor any and all rights which Grantor has with respect to the   management, possession, operation, protection or preservation of the Property.  All reasonable   costs, expenses and liabilities of every character incurred by Noteholder in managing, operating,   maintaining, protecting or preserving the Property shall constitute a demand obligation (which   obligation Grantor hereby expressly promises to pay) owing by Grantor to Noteholder and shall   bear interest from date of expenditure until paid at the rate described in Section 2.3 hereof, all of   which shall constitute a portion of the secured indebtedness and shall be secured by this   Mortgage and by any other instrument securing the secured indebtedness.  If necessary to obtain   the possession provided for above, Noteholder may invoke any and all lawful remedies to   dispossess Grantor.  In connection with any action taken by Noteholder pursuant to this Section   4.3, Noteholder shall not be liable for any loss sustained by Grantor resulting from any act or   omission of Noteholder in managing the Property unless such loss is caused by the willful   misconduct, gross negligence, fraud or bad faith of Noteholder, nor shall Noteholder be obligated   to perform or discharge any obligation, duty or liability of Grantor arising under any agreement   forming a part of the Property or arising under any Permitted Encumbrance prior to any    foreclosure on, appointment of a receiver for, or deed-in-lieu with respect thereto by or on behalf   of Trustee or Noteholder.  Grantor hereby assents to, ratifies and confirms any and all actions of   Noteholder with respect to the Property taken under this Section 4.3. without wilful misconduct   and bad faith.     Section 4.4 Foreclosure.  Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event   of Default, Trustee, or his successor or substitute, is authorized and empowered and it shall be   his special duty at the request of Noteholder to sell the Mortgaged Properties or any part thereof   as an entirety or in parcels as Noteholder may elect, at such place or places and otherwise in the   manner and upon such notice as may be required by law or, in the absence of any such   requirement, as Trustee may deem appropriate.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, any   sale may be adjourned by announcement at the time and place appointed for such sale without   further notice except as may be required by law.  The sale by Trustee of less than the whole of   the Mortgaged Properties shall not exhaust the power of sale herein granted, and Trustee is   specifically empowered to make successive sale or sales under such power until the whole of the     

 





          17               Mortgaged Properties shall be sold; and, if the proceeds of such sale of less than the whole of the   Mortgaged Properties shall be less than the aggregate of the indebtedness secured hereby and the   expense of executing this trust as provided herein, this Mortgage and the lien hereof shall remain   in full force and effect as to the unsold portion of the Mortgaged Properties just as though no sale   had been made; provided, however, that Grantor shall never have any right to require the sale of   less than the whole of the Mortgaged Properties but Noteholder shall have the right, at its sole   election, to request Trustee to sell less than the whole of the Mortgaged Properties.  After each   sale, Trustee shall make to the purchaser or purchasers at such sale good and sufficient   conveyances in the name of Grantor, conveying the property so sold to the purchaser or   purchasers with special warranty of title, and shall receive the proceeds of said sale or sales and   apply the same as herein provided.  The power of sale granted herein shall not be exhausted by   any sale held hereunder by Trustee or his substitute or successor, and such power of sale may be   exercised from time to time and as many times as Noteholder may deem necessary until all of the   Mortgaged Properties have been duly sold and all secured indebtedness has been fully paid.  In   the event any sale hereunder is not completed or is defective in the opinion of Noteholder, such   sale shall not exhaust the power of sale hereunder and Noteholder shall have the right to cause a   subsequent sale or sales to be made hereunder.  Any and all statements of fact or other recitals   made in any deed or deeds given by Trustee or any successor or substitute appointed hereunder   as to nonpayment of the secured indebtedness beyond any applicable cure or grace period or as   to the occurrence of any other Event of Default, or as to Noteholder’s having declared all of said   indebtedness to be due and payable, or as to the request to sell, or as to notice of time, place and   terms of sale and the properties to be sold having been duly given, or as to the refusal, failure or   inability to act of Trustee or any substitute or successor trustee, or as to the appointment of any   substitute or successor trustee, or as to any other act or thing having been duly done by   Noteholder or by such Trustee, substitute or successor, shall be taken as prima facie evidence of   the truth of the facts so stated and recited.  The Trustee or his successor or substitute may appoint   or delegate any one or more persons as agent to perform any act or acts necessary or incident to   any sale held by Trustee, including the posting of notices and the conduct of sale, but in the name   and on behalf of Trustee, his successor or substitute.  If Trustee or his successor or substitute   shall have given notice of sale hereunder, any successor or substitute Trustee thereafter   appointed may complete the sale and the conveyance of the property pursuant thereto as if such   notice had been given by the successor or substitute Trustee conducting the sale.  Cumulative of   the foregoing provisions, it being expressly understood that:     As to Mortgaged Properties located in the State of Texas, such sales of all or any   part of such Mortgaged Properties shall be conducted at the courthouse of any   county (whether or not the counties in which the Mortgaged Properties are located   are contiguous) in the State of Texas in which any part of the Mortgaged   Properties is situated, at public venue to the highest bidder for cash between the   hours of ten o’clock a.m. and four o’clock p.m. (and not later than three hours   after the time of sale set forth in the notice thereof) on the first Tuesday in any   month or at such other place, time and date as provided by the statutes of the State   of Texas then in force governing sales of real estate under powers conferred by   deed of trust, after having given notice of such sale in accordance with such   statutes.       

 





          18               A POWER OF SALE HAS BEEN GRANTED IN THIS MORTGAGE.  A POWER   OF SALE MAY ALLOW TRUSTEE TO TAKE THE MORTGAGED PROPERTIES   AND SELL THEM WITHOUT GOING TO COURT IN A FORECLOSURE ACTION   DURING THE CONTINUANCE OF AN EVENT OF DEFAULT BY GRANTOR UNDER   THIS MORTGAGE.     Section 4.5 Effective as Mortgage.  This instrument shall be effective as a mortgage as   well as a deed of trust and upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of   Default may be foreclosed as to any of the Property in any manner permitted by applicable law,   and any foreclosure suit may be brought by Trustee or by Noteholder.  To the extent, if any,   required to cause this instrument to be so effective as a mortgage as well as a deed of trust,   Grantor hereby mortgages the Mortgaged Properties to Noteholder.  In the event a foreclosure   hereunder shall be commenced by Trustee, or his substitute or successor, Noteholder may at any   time before the sale of the Property direct Trustee to abandon the sale, and may then institute suit   for the collection of the Note and/or any other secured indebtedness, and for the foreclosure of   this Mortgage.  It is agreed that if Noteholder should institute a suit for the collection of the Note   or any other secured indebtedness and for the foreclosure of this Mortgage, Noteholder may at   any time before the entry of a final judgment in said suit dismiss the same, and require Trustee,   his substitute or successor to sell the Property in accordance with the provisions of this   Mortgage.     Section 4.6 Receiver.  In addition to all other remedies herein provided for, Grantor   agrees that, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, Noteholder   shall as a matter of right be entitled to the appointment of a receiver or receivers for all or any   part of the Property, whether such receivership be incident to a proposed sale (or sales) of such   Property or otherwise, and without regard to the value of the Property or the solvency of any   person or persons liable for the payment of the indebtedness secured hereby, and Grantor does   hereby consent to the appointment of such receiver or receivers, waives any and all defenses to   such appointment, and agrees not to oppose any application therefor by Noteholder, and agrees   that such appointment shall in no manner impair, prejudice or otherwise affect the rights of   Noteholder under Article III hereof.  Nothing herein is to be construed to deprive Noteholder of   any other right, remedy or privilege it may now or hereafter have under the law to have a   receiver appointed.  Any money advanced by Noteholder in connection with any such   receivership shall be a demand obligation (which obligation Grantor hereby expressly promises   to pay) owing by Grantor to Noteholder and shall bear interest from the date of making such   advancement by Noteholder until paid, at the rate described in Section 2.3 hereof.     Section 4.7 Proceeds of Foreclosure.  The proceeds of any sale held by Trustee or any   receiver or public officer in foreclosure of the liens and security interests evidenced hereby shall   be applied:     FIRST, to the payment of all necessary costs and expenses incident to such   foreclosure sale, including but not limited to all court costs and charges of every   character in the event foreclosed by suit, and a reasonable fee (not exceeding five percent     

 





          19               (5%) of the gross proceeds of such sale) to Trustee acting under the provisions of   Section 4.4 if foreclosed by power of sale as provided in said section;     SECOND, to the payment of the secured indebtedness (including specifically   without limitation the principal, interest and reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys’ fees due   and unpaid on the Note and the amounts due and unpaid and owed to Noteholder under   this Mortgage) in such manner and order as Noteholder may elect; and     THIRD, the remainder, if any there shall be, shall be paid to Grantor, or to   Grantor’s heirs, devisees, representatives, successors or assigns, or such other persons as   may be entitled thereto by law.   Section 4.8 Noteholder as Purchaser.  Each of Noteholder, Grantor and any guarantor   of the secured indebtedness shall have the right to become the purchaser at any sale held by any   Trustee or substitute or successor or by any receiver or public officer and any Noteholder   purchasing at any such sale shall have the right to credit upon the amount of the bid made   therefor, to the extent necessary to satisfy such bid, the secured indebtedness owing to such   Noteholder, or if such Noteholder holds less than all of such indebtedness, the pro rata part   thereof owing to such Noteholder, accounting to all other Noteholders not joining in such bid in   cash for the portion of such bid or bids apportionable to such non-bidding Noteholder or   Noteholders.     Section 4.9 Personal Property Foreclosure.  Upon the occurrence and during the   continuance of an Event of Default, Noteholder may exercise its rights of enforcement with   respect to the Collateral under the Texas Business and Commerce Code as amended (or under   the Uniform Commercial Code in force in any other state to the extent the same is applicable   law) and in conjunction with, in addition to or in substitution for those rights and remedies:     (a) Noteholder may enter upon Grantor’s premises to take possession of,   assemble and collect the Collateral or to render it unusable; and     (b) Noteholder may require Grantor to assemble the Collateral and make it   available at a place Noteholder designates which is mutually convenient to allow   Noteholder to take possession or dispose of the Collateral; and     (c) written notice mailed to Grantor as provided herein at least fifteen (15)   days prior to the date of public sale of the Collateral or prior to the date after which   private sale of the Collateral will be made shall constitute reasonable notice; and     (d) any sale made pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be deemed to   have been a public sale conducted in a commercially reasonable manner if held   contemporaneously with and upon the same notice as required for the sale of the   Mortgaged Properties under power of sale as provided in Section 4.4 of this Mortgage;   and       

 





          20               (e) in the event of a foreclosure sale, whether made by Trustee under the   terms hereof, or under judgment of a court, the Collateral and the Mortgaged Properties   may, at the option of Noteholder, be sold as a whole; and     (f) it shall not be necessary that Noteholder take possession of the Collateral   or any part thereof prior to the time that any sale pursuant to the provisions of this section   is conducted and it shall not be necessary that the Collateral or any part thereof be present   at the location of such sale; and     (g) prior to application of proceeds of disposition of the Collateral to the   secured indebtedness, such proceeds shall be applied to the reasonable expenses of   retaking, holding, preparing for sale or lease, selling, leasing and the like and the   reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys’ fees and legal expenses incurred by Noteholder; and     (h) any and all statements of fact or other recitals made in any bill of sale or   assignment or other instrument evidencing any foreclosure sale hereunder as to   nonpayment of the secured indebtedness beyond any applicable cure or grace period or as   to the occurrence of any other Event of Default, or as to Noteholder having declared all   of such indebtedness to be due and payable, or as to notice of time, place and terms of   sale and of the properties to be sold having been duly given, or as to any other act or   thing having been duly done by Noteholder, shall be taken as prima facie evidence of the   truth of the facts so stated and recited; and     (i) Noteholder may appoint or delegate any one or more persons as agent to   perform any act or acts necessary or incident to any sale held by Noteholder, including   the sending of notices and the conduct of the sale, but in the name and on behalf of   Noteholder.     Section 4.10 Foreclosure as to Matured Debt. Upon the occurrence and during the   continuance of an Event of Default, Noteholder shall have the right to proceed with foreclosure   of the liens and security interests hereunder without declaring the entire secured indebtedness   due, and in such event, any such foreclosure sale may be made subject to the unmatured part of   the secured indebtedness and shall not in any manner affect the unmatured part of the secured   indebtedness, but as to such unmatured part, this Mortgage shall remain in full force and effect   just as though no sale had been made.  The proceeds of such sale shall be applied as provided in   Section 4.7 except that the amount paid under clause SECOND thereof shall be only the matured   portion of the secured indebtedness and any proceeds of such sale in excess of those provided for   in clauses FIRST and SECOND (modified as provided above) shall be applied as provided in   clause SECOND AND THIRD of Section 3.4 hereof.  Several sales may be made hereunder   without exhausting the right of sale for any unmatured part of the secured indebtedness.     Section 4.11 Remedies Cumulative.  All remedies herein expressly provided for are   cumulative of each other and of all other remedies existing at law or in equity and are cumulative   of any and all other remedies provided for in any other Loan Document, and Trustee and   Noteholder shall, in addition to the remedies herein provided, be entitled to avail themselves of     

 





          21               all such other remedies as may now or hereafter exist at law or in equity for the collection of the   secured indebtedness and the enforcement of the covenants herein and the foreclosure of the   liens and security interests evidenced hereby, and the resort to any remedy provided for   hereunder or under any such other Loan Document or provided for by law shall not prevent the   concurrent or subsequent employment of any other appropriate remedy or remedies.     Section 4.12 Noteholder’s Discretion as to Security.  Noteholder may resort to any   security given by this Mortgage or to any other security now existing or hereafter given to secure   the payment of the secured indebtedness, in whole or in part, and in such portions and in such   order as Noteholder may deem appropriate, and any such action shall not in any way be   considered as a waiver of any of the rights, benefits, liens or security interests evidenced by this   Mortgage.     Section 4.13 Grantor’s Waiver of Certain Rights.  To the full extent Grantor may do so,   Grantor agrees that Grantor will not at any time insist upon, plead, claim or take the benefit or   advantage of any law now or hereafter in force providing for any appraisement, valuation, stay,   extension or redemption, and Grantor, for Grantor, Grantor’s heirs, devisees, representatives,   successors and assigns, and for any and all persons ever claiming any interest in the Property, to   the extent permitted by applicable law, hereby waives and releases all rights of redemption,   valuation, appraisement, stay of execution, notice of intention to mature or declare due the whole   of the secured indebtedness, notice of election to mature or declare due the whole of the secured   indebtedness and all rights to a marshaling of assets of Grantor, including the Property, or to a   sale in inverse order of alienation in the event of foreclosure of the liens and/or security interests   hereby created.  To the full extent Grantor may do so, Grantor shall not have or assert any right   under any statute or rule of law pertaining to the marshaling of assets, sale in inverse order of   alienation, the exemption of homestead, the administration of estates of decedents, or other   matters whatever to defeat, reduce or affect the right of Noteholder under the terms of this   Mortgage to a sale of the Property for the collection of the secured indebtedness without any   prior or different resort for collection, or the right of Noteholder under the terms of this   Mortgage to the payment of the secured indebtedness out of the proceeds of sale of the Property   in preference to every other claimant whatever.  If any law referred to in this section and now in   force, of which Grantor or Grantor’s heirs, devisees, representatives, successors or assigns or any   other persons claiming any interest in the Mortgaged Properties or the Collateral might take   advantage despite this section, shall hereafter be repealed or cease to be in force, such law shall   not thereafter be deemed to preclude the application of this section.       Section 4.14 Grantor as Tenant Post-Foreclosure.  In the event there is a foreclosure   sale hereunder and at the time of such sale Grantor or Grantor’s heirs, devisees, representatives,   successors or assigns or any other persons claiming any interest in the Property by, through or   under Grantor are occupying or using the Property, or any part thereof, each and all shall   immediately become the tenant of the purchaser at such sale, which tenancy shall be a tenancy   from day to day, terminable at the will of either landlord or tenant, at a reasonable rental per day   based upon the value of the Property occupied, such rental to be due daily to the purchaser.  To   the extent permitted by applicable law, the purchaser at such sale shall, notwithstanding any   language herein apparently to the contrary, have the sole option to demand immediate possession     

 





          22               following the sale or to permit the occupants to remain as tenants at will.  In the event the tenant   fails to surrender possession of said property upon demand, the purchaser shall be entitled to   institute and maintain a summary action for possession of the property (such as an action for   forcible entry and detainer) in any court having jurisdiction.   Section 4.15 Interest Limitation.  It is the intention of the parties hereto to comply with   all applicable usury laws; accordingly, it is agreed that notwithstanding any provisions to the   contrary in any Loan Document, in no event shall any Loan Document require or allow the   payment, taking, receiving or charging or permit the collection of interest in excess of the   maximum amount permitted by applicable usury law, and all such documents shall be subject to   interest reduction to the amount allowed under such laws.  If any such excess of interest is   contracted for, taken, charged, reserved or received, under any Loan Document, or in the event   the maturity of any of the secured indebtedness is accelerated in whole or in part, or in the event   that all or part of the principal or interest of the secured indebtedness shall be prepaid, so that   under any of such circumstances, the amount of interest contracted for, taken, charged or   received, under any Loan Document, and the amount of principal actually outstanding from time   to time under the instruments evidencing the secured indebtedness, shall exceed the maximum   amount of interest permitted by the applicable usury laws, now or hereafter enacted, then in any   such event (a) the provisions of this section shall govern and control, (b) neither Grantor nor any   other person or entity now or hereafter liable for the payment of the secured indebtedness shall   be obligated to pay the amount of such interest to the extent that it is in excess of the maximum   amount of interest permitted by the applicable usury laws, now or hereafter enacted, (c) any such   excess shall be cancelled automatically, (d) any such excess that may have been collected shall   be either applied as a credit against the then unpaid principal amount or refunded to Grantor, at   Noteholder’s option, and (e) the effective rate of interest shall be automatically reduced to the   maximum lawful contract rate allowed under the applicable usury laws, now or hereafter   enacted.  It is further agreed that without limitation of the foregoing, all calculations of the rate   of interest contracted for, taken, charged or received under any Loan Document that are made for   the purpose of determining whether such rate exceeds the maximum lawful contract rate, shall be   made, to the extent permitted by the applicable usury laws, now or hereafter enacted, by   amortizing, prorating, allocating and spreading in equal parts during the period of the full stated   term of the loans evidenced by the instruments evidencing the secured indebtedness, all interest   at any time contracted for, taken, charged or received from Grantor or otherwise by Noteholder   in connection with such loans.  Grantor does not agree to pay usurious interest.  Further, the   Noteholder hereby consents to the aforementioned paragraph.  To the extent this provision   conflicts with or is inconsistent with any provision of the Note, the terms of the Note shall   prevail and control.    Section 4.16 Montana Provision.  In the event there is a foreclosure sale hereunder and   at the time of such sale Grantor or Grantor’s heirs, devisees, representatives, successors or   assigns or any other persons claiming any interest in the Property by, through or under Grantor   are occupying or using the Property, or any part thereof, each and all shall immediately become   the tenant of the purchaser at such sale, which tenancy shall be a tenancy from day to day,   terminable at the will of either landlord or tenant, at a reasonable rental per day based upon the   value of the Property occupied, such rental to be due daily to the purchaser.  To the extent     

 





          23               permitted by applicable law, the purchaser at such sale shall, notwithstanding any language   herein apparently to the contrary, have the sole option to demand immediate possession   following the sale or to permit the occupants to remain as tenants at will.  In the event the tenant   fails to surrender possession of said property upon demand, the purchaser shall be entitled to   institute and maintain a summary action for possession of the property (such as an action for   forcible entry and detainer) in any court having jurisdiction.     ARTICLE V.      Miscellaneous     Section 5.1 Scope of Mortgage.  This Mortgage is a deed of trust and mortgage of   both real and personal property, a security agreement, a financing statement and an absolute   assignment, and also covers proceeds and fixtures.     Section 5.2 Effective as a Financing Statement.  This Mortgage covers goods which   are or are to become fixtures on the real property described herein.  This Mortgage shall be   effective as a financing statement filed as a fixture filing with respect to all fixtures included   within the Property and is to be filed for record in the real estate records of each county where   any part of the Mortgaged Properties (including said fixtures) is situated.  This Mortgage shall   also be effective as a financing statement covering minerals or the like (including oil and gas)   and accounts subject to Subsection (e) of Section 9.103 of the Texas Business and Commerce   Code, as amended, and similar provisions (if any) of the Uniform Commercial Code as enacted   in any other state where the Mortgaged Properties are situated which will be financed at the   wellhead or minehead of the wells or mines located on the Mortgaged Properties and is to be   filed for record in the real estate records of each county where any part of the Mortgaged   Properties is situated.  This Mortgage shall also be effective as a financing statement covering   any other Property and may be filed in any other appropriate filing or recording office.  The   mailing address of Grantor is the address of Grantor set forth at the end of this Mortgage and the   address of Noteholder from which information concerning the security interests hereunder may   be obtained is the address of Noteholder set forth at the end of this Mortgage.     Section 5.3 Reproduction of Mortgage as Financing Statement. A carbon,   photographic or other reproduction of this Mortgage or of any financing statement relating to this   Mortgage shall be sufficient as a financing statement for any of the purposes referred to in   Section 5.2.     Section 5.4 Notice to Account Debtors.  In addition to the rights granted in Article III   hereof, Noteholder may at any time after an Event of Default notify the account debtors or   obligors of any accounts, chattel paper, negotiable instruments or other evidences of   indebtedness included in the Collateral to pay Noteholder directly.     Section 5.5 Waiver by Noteholder.  Noteholder may at any time and from time to time   in writing waive compliance by Grantor with any covenant herein made by Grantor to the extent   and in the manner specified in such writing, or consent to Grantor’s doing any act which     

 





          24               hereunder Grantor is prohibited from doing, or to Grantor’s failing to do any act which hereunder   Grantor is required to do, to the extent and in the manner specified in such writing, or release any   part of the Property or any interest therein or any proceeds of Production from the lien and   security interest of this Mortgage, without the joinder of Trustee, or release any party liable,   either directly or indirectly, for the secured indebtedness or for any covenant herein or in any   other Loan Document, without impairing or releasing the liability of any other party.  No such   act shall in any way impair the rights or powers of Noteholder or Trustee hereunder except to the   extent specifically agreed to by Noteholder in such writing.     Section 5.6 No Impairment of Security.  The lien, security interest and other security   rights of Noteholder hereunder shall not be impaired by any indulgence, moratorium or release   granted by Noteholder including, but not limited to, any renewal, extension or modification   which Noteholder may grant with respect to any secured indebtedness, or any surrender,   compromise, release, renewal, extension, exchange or substitution which Noteholder may grant   in respect of the Property (including without limitation Production Proceeds), or any part thereof   or any interest therein, or any release or indulgence granted to any endorser, guarantor or surety   of any secured indebtedness.      Section 5.7 Acts Not Constituting Waiver by Noteholder.  Noteholder may waive any   default or Event of Default without waiving any other prior or subsequent default or Event of   Default.  Noteholder may remedy any Event of Default without waiving the Event of Default   remedied.  Neither failure by Noteholder to exercise, nor delay by Noteholder in exercising, any   right, power or remedy during the continuance of any Event of Default shall be construed as a   waiver of such Event of Default or as a waiver of the right to exercise any such right, power or   remedy at a later date (unless such Event of Default has been cured or expressly waived by   Noteholder).  No single or partial exercise by Noteholder of any right, power or remedy   hereunder shall exhaust the same or shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof, and   every such right, power or remedy hereunder may be exercised at any time and from time to   time.  No modification or waiver of any provision hereof nor consent to any departure by   Grantor therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed   by Noteholder and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instances,   for the purpose for which given and to the extent therein specified.  No notice to nor demand on   Grantor in any case shall of itself entitle Grantor to any other or further notice of demand in   similar or other circumstances.  Acceptance by Noteholder of any payment in an amount less   than the amount then due on any secured indebtedness shall be deemed an acceptance on account   only and shall not in any way excuse the existence of a default hereunder.     Section 5.8 Grantor’s Successors.  In the event the ownership of the Property or any   part thereof becomes vested in a person other than Grantor, Noteholder may, without notice to   Grantor, deal with such successor or successors in interest with reference to this Mortgage and to   the indebtedness secured hereby in the same manner as with Grantor, without in any way   vitiating or discharging Grantor’s liability hereunder or for the payment of the indebtedness or   performance of the obligations secured hereby.  No transfer of the Property, no forbearance on   the part of Noteholder, and no extension of the time for the payment of the indebtedness secured   hereby given by Noteholder shall operate to release, discharge, modify, change or affect, in     

 





          25               whole or in part, the liability of Grantor hereunder or for the payment of the indebtedness or   performance of the obligations secured hereby or the liability of any other person hereunder or   for the payment of the indebtedness secured hereby.     Section 5.9 Place of Payment.  All secured indebtedness which may be owing   hereunder at any time by Grantor shall be payable at the place designated in the Note (or if no   such designation is made, at the address of Noteholder indicated at the end of this Mortgage), or   at such other place as Noteholder may designate in writing.     Section 5.10 Subrogation to Existing Liens.  To the extent that proceeds of the Note are   used to pay indebtedness secured by any outstanding lien, security interest, charge or prior   encumbrance against the Property, such proceeds have been advanced by Noteholder at   Grantor’s request, and Noteholder shall be subrogated to any and all rights, security interests and   liens owned by any owner or holder of such outstanding liens, security interests, charges or   encumbrances, irrespective of whether said liens, security interests, charges or encumbrances are   released, and it is expressly understood that, in consideration of the payment of such   indebtedness by Noteholder, Grantor hereby waives and releases all demands and causes of   action for offsets and payments to, upon and in connection with the said indebtedness.     Section 5.11 Application of Payments to Certain Indebtedness.  If any part of the   secured indebtedness cannot be lawfully secured by this Mortgage or if any part of the Property   cannot be lawfully subject to the lien and security interest hereof to the full extent of such   indebtedness, then all payments made shall be applied on said indebtedness first in discharge of   that portion thereof which is not secured by this Mortgage.     Section 5.12 Compliance With Usury Laws.  It is the intent of Grantor and Noteholder   and all other parties to the Loan Documents to contract in strict compliance with applicable   usury law from time to time in effect.  In furtherance thereof, it is stipulated and agreed that none   of the terms and provisions contained herein and in the Loan Documents shall ever be construed   to create a contract to pay, for the use, forbearance or detention of money, interest in excess of   the maximum amount of interest permitted to be charged by applicable law from time to time in   effect.       Section 5.13 Trustees.  The Trustee may resign by an instrument in writing addressed to   Noteholder, or Trustee may be removed at any time with or without cause by an instrument in   writing executed by Noteholder.  In case of the death, resignation, removal, or disqualification of   Trustee, or if for any reason Noteholder shall deem it desirable to appoint a substitute or   successor trustee to act instead of the herein named trustee or any substitute or successor trustee   or to appoint an additional trustee or trustees to serve concurrently with Trustee, then Noteholder   shall have the right and is hereby authorized and empowered to appoint a successor trustee, a   substitute trustee or an additional trustee, without other formality than appointment and   designation in writing executed by Noteholder and the authority hereby conferred shall extend to   the appointment of other successor, substitute and additional trustees successively until the   indebtedness secured hereby has been paid in full, or until the Property is sold hereunder.        

 





          26               Section 5.14 No Liability for Trustee.  The Trustee shall not be liable for any error of   judgment or act done by Trustee in good faith, or be otherwise responsible or accountable under   any circumstances whatsoever, except for Trustee’s gross negligence, fraud or willful   misconduct.  The Trustee shall have the right to rely on any instrument, document or signature   authorizing or supporting any action taken or proposed to be taken by him hereunder, believed   by him in good faith to be genuine.  All moneys received by Trustee shall, until used or applied   as herein provided, be held in trust for the purposes for which they were received, but need not   be segregated in any manner from any other moneys (except to the extent required by law), and   Trustee shall be under no liability for interest on any moneys received by him hereunder.    Grantor hereby ratifies and confirms any and all acts which the herein named Trustee or his   successor or successors, substitute or substitutes, in this trust, shall do lawfully by virtue hereof.    Grantor will reimburse Trustee for, and save him harmless against, any and all liability and   expenses which may be incurred by him in the performance of his duties.     Section 5.15 Release of Mortgage.  If all of the secured indebtedness be paid (other   than contingent indemnification obligations to the extent no claim giving rise thereto has been   asserted) and Noteholder shall have no further obligation to provide credit or advance funds to   Grantor or the maker of any Note secured hereby, then, and in that event only, all rights under   this Mortgage shall terminate (except to the extent expressly provided herein with respect to   indemnifications and other rights which are expressly to continue following the release hereof)   and the Property shall become wholly clear of the liens, security interests, conveyances and   assignments evidenced hereby, and evidence of such release of liens and security interests shall   be provided by Noteholder in due form at Grantor’s cost.     Section 5.16 Notices. All notices, requests, consents, demands and other   communications required or permitted hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be in   writing and, unless otherwise specifically provided in such other Loan Document, shall be   deemed sufficiently given or furnished if delivered by personal delivery, by electronic mail, by   expedited delivery service with proof of delivery, or by registered or certified United States mail,   postage prepaid, at the following addresses (unless changed by similar notice in writing given by   the particular party whose address is to be changed).

Section 5.17 Invalidity of Certain Provisions.  A determination that any provision of   this Mortgage is unenforceable or invalid shall not affect the enforceability or validity of any   other provision and the determination that the application of any provision of this Mortgage to   any person or circumstance is illegal or unenforceable shall not affect the enforceability or   validity of such provision as it may apply to other persons or circumstances.
