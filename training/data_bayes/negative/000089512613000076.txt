The Plan, a copy of which has been made available to the Participant, is hereby incorporated by reference herein and made a part hereof for all purposes, and when taken with this Agreement shall govern the rights of the Participant and the Company with respect to the Award (as defined below). Any capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement have the same meanings given to them in the Plan.  The Participant acknowledges that he or she has received a copy of, or has online access to, the Plan, and hereby accepts the Performance Share Units (“PSUs”) subject to all the terms and provisions of the Plan and this Agreement. Such acceptance may be in any manner that the Committee may establish pursuant to the Notice, including deemed acceptance. The Participant hereby further agrees that he or she has received a copy of, or has online access to, the most recent Form S-8 prospectus relating to the Plan and hereby acknowledges his or her acceptance and receipt of such prospectus electronically.2.    Grant of Award. The Company hereby awards to the Participant the number of PSUs in accordance with the Notice, on the terms and conditions set forth herein, in the Plan and in the Notice (the “Award”).  The Award gives the Participant the opportunity to earn the right to receive payment of cash for each PSU awarded in accordance with this Agreement and the Notice.  The Award is subject to adjustment under the terms of the Plan. This Agreement and the Notice establish vesting requirements and determination of payment based on attainment by the Company of specified performance levels for the Performance Measures described in the Notice during the period commencing on the grant date and ending on the date set forth in the Notice (the “Performance Period”), as established and determined by the Committee.  The Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder of the Company with respect to the PSUs.3.    Vesting and Forfeiture.(a)    The PSUs will vest based on the Participant’s continuous employment with or service to the Company, a Subsidiary or Affiliated Entity in accordance with the vesting schedule set forth on the Notice.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, a Participant shall not be entitled to any payment under this Agreement unless and until the Committee certifies the level of performance respecting the Performance Measures that has been achieved and the Participant satisfies applicable vesting conditions for such payment. (b)    Forfeiture. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, in its sole discretion in accordance with the terms of the Plan, any unvested Performance Share Units shall be forfeited when a Participant ceases to be an Eligible Person.4.    Fundamental Transaction; Change of Control.  In accordance with the terms of the Plan, upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Transaction or a Change of Control, all PSUs shall be deemed to have achieved a level of performance respecting the Performance Measures equal to the higher of (i) such performance level as required to achieve the Target PSU Allocation (as described in the Notice) or (ii) the actual performance level. The Committee may, in its discretion, adjust the level of performance respecting the Performance Measures described above to account for the change in any specified Performance Measure caused by measuring such values over the period commencing on the grant date and ending on the date of the Fundamental Transaction or Change of Control instead of over the Performance Period. All PSUs awarded pursuant to this paragraph 4 shall be deemed to fully vest at such time.5.    Nontransferability of Award. A PSU is not transferable other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Any attempted sale, assignment, transfer, pledge, hypothecation or other disposition of, or the levy of execution, attachment or similar process upon, a PSU contrary to the provisions hereof shall be void and ineffective, shall give no right to any purported transferee, and may, at the sole discretion of the Committee, result in forfeiture of the PSU involved in such attempt.6.    Payment. The payment date(s) with respect to all PSUs in which a Participant becomes vested shall be the earlier of (i) the payment date(s) set forth on the Notice or, (ii) in the event of a Fundamental Transaction or Change of Control, no later than 60 days following such Fundamental Transaction or Change of Control.7.    Withholding. The Company may make such provision as it may deem appropriate for the withholding of any applicable federal, state or local taxes that it determines it may be obligated to withhold or pay in connection with the PSUs.28.    Amendments. This Award Agreement may be amended by a written agreement signed by the Company and the Participant; provided that the Committee may modify the terms of this Award Agreement without the consent of the Participant in any manner that is not adverse to the Participant.9.    Securities Law Restrictions. This Award shall be issued, vested and paid only in compliance with the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”), and any other applicable securities law, or pursuant to an exemption therefrom. 10.    Participant Misconduct. (a)     Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or this Agreement to the contrary, the Committee shall have the authority to determine that in the event of serious misconduct by the Participant (including violations of employment agreements, confidentiality or other proprietary matters) or any activity of a Participant in competition with the business of the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliated Entity, the PSUs may be cancelled, in whole or in part, whether or not vested. The determination of whether a Participant has engaged in serious misconduct or any activity in competition with the business of the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliated Entity shall be determined by the Committee in good faith and in its sole discretion. This paragraph 10 shall have no effect and be deleted from this Agreement following a Change of Control.(b)     The Award made pursuant to this Agreement is subject to recovery pursuant to the Company’s compensation recovery policy then in effect. To the extent required by applicable laws, rules, regulations or securities exchange listing requirements and the Company’s compensation recovery policy then in effect, the Company shall have the right, and shall take all actions necessary, to recover the incentive compensation received by the Participant pursuant to the Award.11.    Notices. All notices or other communications relating to the Plan and this Agreement as it relates to the Participant shall be in electronic or written form. If in writing, such notices shall be deemed to have been made if personally delivered, or if mailed, by regular U.S. mail, postage prepaid, by the Company to the Participant at his last known address evidenced on the payroll records of the Company.12.    Binding Effect and Governing Law. This Agreement shall be (i) binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, successors and assigns except as may be limited by the Plan and (ii) governed and construed under the laws of the State of Oklahoma.13.    Captions. The captions of specific provisions of this Agreement are for convenience and reference only, and in no way define, describe, extend or limit the scope of this Agreement or the intent of any provision hereof.14.    Counterparts; Entire Agreement. This Agreement may be accepted by the required form of acceptance established by the Committee pursuant to the Notice, 3which may include deemed acceptance. If execution of the Notice is the required form of acceptance established by the Committee, then such execution may be in any number of identical counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original for all purposes, but all of which taken together shall form but one agreement. This Agreement, together with the Notice, shall constitute the entire agreement between the parties.15.    Code Section 409A. The Agreement and all Awards granted hereunder are intended to comply with, or otherwise be exempt from, Code Section 409A.  The Plan and all Awards shall be administered, interpreted, and construed in a manner constituent with Code Section 409A or an exemption thereform.  Should any provision of the Plan, the Agreement or any Award hereunder be found not to comply with, or otherwise be exempt from, the provisions of the Code Section 409A, such provision shall be modified and given effect (retroactively if necessary), in the sole discretion of the Committee, and without the consent of the Participant, in such manner as the Committee determines to be necessary or appropriate to comply with, or to effectuate an exemption from, Code Section 409A.  Without limiting the foregoing and notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, to the extent required in order to avoid accelerated taxation or tax penalties under Section 409A, amounts that would otherwise be payable and benefits that would otherwise be provided pursuant to this Plan during the six-month period immediately following the Employee’s separation from service shall instead be paid on the first business day after the date that is six months following the Executive’s termination date (or death, if earlier), with interest from the date such amounts would otherwise have been paid at the short-term applicable federal rate, compounded semi-annually, as determined under Section 1274 of the Code, for the month in which payment would have been made but for the delay in payment required to avoid the imposition of an additional rate of tax on the Employee under Section 409A.  Any payments to be made under this Plan upon a termination of employment shall only be made if such termination of employment constitutes a “separation from service” under Section 409A. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes no representations that the payments and benefits provided under this Plan comply with Section 409A and in no event shall the Company be liable for all or any portion of any taxes, penalties, interest or other expenses that may be incurred by the Employee on account of non-compliance with Section 409A.    4Notice of PSU AwardChesapeake Energy CorporationID: 73-13957336100 N.
