Section 2.9  Payment of Proceeds.  In the event that, for its convenience, Lender should elect with respect to all or particular Mineral Properties or Contracts not to exercise immediately its right to receive Hydrocarbons or Proceeds of Runs, then the purchasers or other Persons obligated to make such payment shall continue to make payment to Mortgagor until such time as written demand has been made upon them by Lender that payment be made direct to Lender.  Such failure to notify such purchasers or other Persons shall not in any way waive, remit or release the right of Lender to receive any payments not theretofore paid over to Mortgagor before the giving of written notice.  In this regard, in the event payments are made direct to Lender, and then, at the request of Lender payments are, for a period or periods of time, paid to Mortgagor, Lender shall nevertheless have the right, effective upon written notice, to require future payments be again made to it.

Section 2.11  Duty to Perform.  Nothing herein contained shall detract from or limit the obligation of Borrower to make prompt payment of the Indebtedness at the time and in the manner provided herein and in the Loan Agreement, regardless of whether the Proceeds of Runs herein assigned are sufficient to pay same.  Mortgagor will do and perform every act required of it by this is Mortgage at the time or times and in the manner specified.

Section 4.1  Taxes.  Mortgagor will pay and discharge promptly when due all taxes, license fees, assessments, and governmental charges or levies imposed upon it or upon its income or upon the Collateral or any part thereof (including production, severance, windfall profit, excise, and other taxes assessed against or measured by the production of, or the value or proceeds of production of, Hydrocarbons; provided, however, Mortgagor shall not be required to pay any such tax, assessment, charge, or levy if the amount, applicability, or validity thereof shall currently be contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings diligently conducted and if the contesting party shall have set up reserves therefor adequate under generally accepted accounting principles (provided that such reserves may be set up under generally accepted accounting principles).




Section 4.2  Insurance.  Mortgagor will procure and maintain for the benefit of Lender original paid-up insurance policies against such liabilities, casualties, risks, and contingencies, in such amounts and form and substance, with such financially sound and reputable companies, and with such expiration dates, as are acceptable to Lender, and containing a noncontributory standard mortgagee clause or its equivalent in favor of Lender. Mortgagor will at all times maintain costs of regaining control of well insurance or similar insurance to the extent customary in the industry in the pertinent area of operations.  Each policy shall contain an agreement by the insurer not to cancel or amend the policy without giving Lender at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of its intention to do so.  Upon request of Lender, Mortgagor will furnish or cause to be furnished to Lender from time to time a summary of the insurance coverage of Mortgagor in form and substance satisfactory to Lender and if requested will furnish Lender original certificates of insurance and copies of the applicable policies and all renewals thereof.  In the event Mortgagor should, for any reason whatsoever, fail to keep the corporeal (tangible) Collateral or any part thereof so insured, or to keep said policies so payable, or fail to deliver to Lender the original or certified policies of insurance and the renewals therefor upon demand, then Lender, if it so elects, may itself have such insurance effected in such amounts and with such companies as it may deem proper and may pay the premiums therefor (as an Advance as defined hereinbelow).  Mortgagor will notify Lender immediately in writing of any material blowout, fire, or other casualty to or accident involving the Mortgaged Property, the Equipment, or the Hydrocarbons, whether or not such blowout, fire, casualty, or accident is covered by insurance.  Mortgagor will promptly further notify Mortgagor's insurance company and to submit an appropriate claim and proof of claim to the insurance company if such a casualty or accident occurs.  In the event of any loss or any of such policies, Lender may, at its election, either apply the net proceeds thereof toward the payment of the Indebtedness or pay the net proceeds thereof to Mortgagor, either wholly or in part, and under such conditions as Lender may determine to enable Mortgagor to repair or restore the Collateral.

Section 4.4  Sale.  Except for (a) sales of severed Hydrocarbons in the ordinary course of Mortgagor's business on the best terms which would be available in bona fide and arms length transactions with third parties not affiliated with Mortgagor (which in the case of production which is subject to price controls or is sold in accordance with customary industry practice pursuant to long term purchase contracts, shall be determined giving consideration to such matters); (b) dispositions made in connection with a permitted (as provided below) release, surrender, or abandonment of a lease; or (c) in the absence of an Event of Default, collection of Accounts and General Intangibles, Mortgagor will not sell, convey, lease, or otherwise transfer or dispose of all or any portion of the Collateral.

Section 4.7  Operation of the Mortgaged Property.  Whether or not Mortgagor is the operator of the Mortgaged Property, Mortgagor will, at Mortgagor's own expense, (a) do all things necessary to keep unimpaired Mortgagor's rights in the Mortgaged Property (subject to any permitted abandonment provisions hereinbelow), (b) cause the lands described in Exhibit A to be maintained, developed, protected against drainage, and continuously operated for the production of hydrocarbons in a good and workmanlike manner as would a prudent operator, and in accordance with generally accepted practices and applicable operating agreements, and (c) cause to be paid, promptly as and when due and payable, all rentals and royalties payable in respect of the Mortgaged Property, and all expenses incurred in or arising from the operation or development of the Mortgaged Property.  Mortgagor will observe and comply with all terms and provisions, express or implied, of the Mineral Properties, and all agreements and contracts of any type relating to the Mortgaged Property, in order to keep the same in full force and effect, including, without limitation, maintenance of productive capacity of each well or unit comprising the Mortgaged Property, and will not, without the prior written consent of Lender, surrender, abandon, or release (or otherwise reduce its rights under) any such lease, in whole or in part, so long as any well situated thereon (whether or not such well is located on the Mineral Properties), or located on any unit containing all or any part of such leases, is capable (or is subject to being made capable through drilling, reworking, or other operations which it would be economically feasible to conduct) of producing hydrocarbons in commercial quantities (as determined without considering the effect of this Mortgage); provided, however, that Mortgagor may, to the extent expressly required by the terms of any such lease under a “Pugh clause” or similar provision, or to the extent otherwise required by law, confirm to the lessor thereof that the lease has by its terms terminated as to any specified portion thereof on which no such well exists.  Without the express prior written consent of Lender, Mortgagor will not abandon or consent to the abandonment of any well producing from the Mortgaged Property (or properties unitized therewith) so long as such well is capable (or is subject to being made capable through drilling, reworking, or other operations which it would be commercially feasible to conduct) of producing hydrocarbons in commercial quantities (as determined without considering the effect of this Mortgage but considering the cost of such drilling, reworking, and other operations).  Mortgagor will not without the express prior written consent of Lender elect not to participate in a proposed operation on the Mortgaged Property where the effects of such election would be the forfeiture either temporarily (i.e., until a certain sum of money is received out of the forfeited interest) or permanently of any interest in the Mortgaged Property.




  



  






 



Section 4.8  Pooling and Unitization.  Mortgagor has the right, and is hereby authorized, to pool or unitize all or any part of any tract of land described in Exhibit A, insofar as relates to the Mortgaged Property, with adjacent lands, leaseholds and other interests, when, in the reasonable judgment of Mortgagor, it is necessary or advisable to do so in order to form a drilling unit to facilitate the orderly development of that part of the Mortgaged Property affected thereby, or to comply with the requirements of any law or governmental order or regulation relating to the spacing of wells or proration of the production therefrom; provided, however, that the Hydrocarbons produced from any unit so formed shall be allocated among the separately owned tracts or interests comprising the unit in proportion to the respective surface areas therefrom; and provided further that Mortgagor is not be entitled to form any such unit without the written consent of Lender (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) if the effect of such formation would be to decrease the amount of Hydrocarbons which would be subject to this Mortgage.  Any unit so formed may relate to one or more zones or horizons, and a unit formed for a particular zone or horizon need not conform in area to any other unit relating to a different zone or horizon, and a unit formed for the production of oil need not conform in area with any unit formed for the production of gas. Immediately after formation of any such unit, Mortgagor shall furnish to Lender a true copy of the pooling agreement, declaration of pooling or other instrument creating such unit, in such number of counterparts as Lender may reasonably request.  The interest in any such unit attributable to the Mortgaged Property (or any part thereof) included therein shall become a part of the Mortgaged Property and shall be subject to the Lien hereof in the same manner and with the same effect as though such unit and the interest of Mortgagor therein were specifically described in Exhibit A.  Mortgagor may enter into pooling or unitization agreements not hereinabove authorized only with the prior written consent of Lender.




Section 4.9  Contracts.  Mortgagor will not enter into any operating agreement or other Contract which materially adversely affects the Collateral or the Mineral Properties, or which is not in the ordinary course of business.  Mortgagor will promptly take all action necessary to enforce or secure the observance or performance of any term, covenant, agreement, or condition to be observed or performed by third parties under any Contract, or any part thereof, or to exercise any of its rights, remedies, powers, and privileges under any Contract, all in accordance with the respective terms thereof.  Mortgagor will not do or permit anything to be done to the Collateral that may violate the terms of any insurance covering the Collateral or any part thereof.




Section 4.10  Condition of Equipment.  Mortgagor will maintain, preserve, and keep the Equipment at all times in thorough repair and good working order and condition, and from time to time make all needful repairs, renewals, and additions so that its value and the Security Interests shall at no time become impaired.

Section 4.15  Financial Statements and Reports.  Mortgagor will furnish to Lender promptly upon the request of Lender, all regular financial statements, reports, budgets, and such other information regarding the business and affairs and financial condition of Mortgagor as Lender may reasonably request.  All financial statements shall be in such detail as Lender may reasonably request and shall conform to generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis, except only for such changes in accounting principles or practice with which the independent certified public accountants concur.




Section 4.16  Further Assurances.  Mortgagor will keep the Lien of this Mortgage valid and unimpaired.  Mortgagor will promptly and in no event later than thirty (30) days after written notice from Lender is received (a) correct any defect, error or omission which may be discovered in the contents of this Mortgage or any financing statement relating thereto or in the execution or acknowledgment of this Mortgage or any financing statement; (b) execute, acknowledge, deliver, and record such further instruments (including, without limitation, further security agreements, financing statements, continuation statements, and assignments of accounts, contract rights, general intangibles, and proceeds) and do such further acts as may be necessary, desirable, or proper to carry out more effectively the purposes of this Mortgage and to more fully identify and subject to the Liens hereof any property intended to be covered hereby, including without limitation any renewals, additions, substitutions, replacements, or accessions to the Collateral; and (c) execute, acknowledge, deliver, and record any document or instrument (including specifically any financing statement) and obtain any consents necessary, desirable, or proper to perfect, protect, or preserve the Lien and Security Interests hereunder against the rights or interests of third persons, including without limitation any applicable  approvals of the Louisiana State Mineral Board or other governmental authority with respect to the inclusion of state leases or other leases from Louisiana governmental authorities within the Mineral Properties affected by this Mortgage.  Mortgagor shall pay all costs connected with any of the foregoing.

Section 5.6  Sale.  Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Lender may exercise all rights of a secured party under the UCC and other applicable law (including the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in another applicable jurisdiction) and, in addition, Lender may, without being required to give any notice, except as herein provided or as may be required by mandatory provisions of law, (a) withdraw all cash in the Collateral Account and apply such cash and other cash, if any, then held by it as Collateral against the Indebtedness or (b) sell the Collateral or any part thereof at public or private sale, for cash, upon credit or for future delivery, and at such price or prices as Lender may deem satisfactory.  Lender may be the purchaser of any or all of the Collateral so sold at any public sale (or, if the Collateral is of a type customarily sold in a recognized market or is of a type which is the subject of widely distributed standard price quotations, at any private sale).  Mortgagor will execute and deliver such documents and take such other action as Lender deems necessary or advisable in order that any such sale may be made in compliance with law.  Upon any such sale Lender shall have the right to deliver, assign, and transfer to the purchaser thereof the Collateral so sold.  Each purchaser at any such sale shall hold the Collateral so sold to it absolutely and free from any claim or right of whatsoever kind, including any equity or right of redemption of Mortgagor which may be waived, and Mortgagor, to the extent permitted by law, hereby specifically waives all rights of redemption, stay, or appraisal which it has or may have under any law now existing or hereafter adopted.  Mortgagor agrees that ten (10) days prior written notice of the time and place of any sale or other intended disposition of any of the Collateral constitutes “reasonable notification” within the meaning of Article 9 of the UCC, except that shorter or no notice shall be reasonable as to any Collateral which is perishable or threatens to decline speedily in value or is of a type customarily sold on a recognized market.  The notice (if any) of such sale shall (1) in case of a public sale, state the time and place fixed for such sale, and (2) in the case of a private sale, state the day after which such sale may be consummated.  Any such public sale shall be held at such time or times within or ordinary business hours and at such place or places as Lender may fix in the notice of such sale.  At any such sale the Collateral may be sold in one lot as an entirety or in separate parcels, as Lender may determine.  Lender shall not be obligated to make any such sale pursuant to any such notice.  Lender may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for the sale, and such sale may be made at any time or place to which the same may be so adjourned.  In case of any sale of all or any part of the Collateral on credit or for future delivery, the Collateral so sold may be retained by Lender until the selling price is paid by the purchaser thereof, but Lender shall not incur any liability in case of the failure of such purchaser to take up and pay for the Collateral so sold and, in case of any such failure, such Collateral may again be sold upon like notice.




  



  






 



Section 5.7  Set-Off.  Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, Lender shall have the right to set-off any funds of Mortgagor in the possession of Lender against any amounts then due by Borrower or Mortgagor to Lender pursuant to the Mortgage.




Section 5.8  Confession of Judgment.  For purposes of foreclosure under Louisiana executory process procedures, Mortgagor hereby acknowledges the Indebtedness and confesses judgment in favor of Lender for the full amount of the Indebtedness.




Section 5.9  Expenses.   Mortgagor will pay all reasonable expenses, including but not limited to reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred in connection with the full protection and preservation of, and foreclosure, collection, or other realization of or on, the Collateral or this Mortgage, or in connection with the enforcement of any of Mortgagor's obligations or Lender's rights and remedies set forth herein, whether or not suit or any foreclosure proceedings are filed.  All insurance expenses and all expenses of protecting, storing, warehousing, appraising, preparing for sale, handling, maintaining, and shipping the Collateral, any and all excise, property, sales, and use taxes imposed by any federal, state, or local authority on any of the Collateral, all expenses in respect of periodic appraisals and inspections of the Collateral to the extent the same may be requested from time to time, and all expenses in respect of the sale or other disposition thereof shall be borne and paid by Mortgagor.  All such expenses shall be treated as Advances as provided in Section 4.24 (“Advances by Lender”) and thus included in the Indebtedness secured hereby.




Section 5.10  Keeper.  In the event the Collateral, or any part thereof, is seized as an incident to an action for the recognition or enforcement of this Mortgage by executory process, ordinary process, sequestration, writ of fieri facias or otherwise, Mortgagor and Lender agree that the court issuing any such order shall, if petitioned for by Lender, direct the applicable sheriff to appoint as a keeper of the Collateral, Lender or any agent designated by Lender or any person named by Lender at the time such seizure is effected.  This designation is pursuant to Louisiana Revised Statutes 9:5131 through 5135 and 9:5136 through 5140.2, as the same may be amended, and Lender shall be entitled to all the rights and benefits afforded thereunder.  It is hereby agreed that the keeper shall be entitled to receive as compensation, in excess of its reasonable costs and expenses incurred in the administration or preservation of the Collateral, an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the gross revenues of the Collateral, which shall be included as Indebtedness secured by this Mortgage. The designation of keeper made herein shall not be deemed to require Lender to provoke the appointment of such a keeper.




  



  






 



Section 5.11  Waivers.  Mortgagor waives in favor of Lender any and all homestead exemptions and other exemptions of seizure or otherwise to which Mortgagor is or may be entitled under the constitution and statutes of the State of Louisiana insofar as the Collateral is concerned.  Mortgagor further waives: (a) the benefit of appraisement as provided in Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure Articles 2332, 2336, 2723 and 2724, and all other laws conferring the same; (b) the demand and three days delay accorded by Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure Articles 2639 and 2721; (c) the notice of seizure required by Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure Articles 2293 and 2721; (d) the three days delay provided by Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure Articles 2331 and 2722; and (e) the benefit of the other provisions of Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure Articles 2331, 2722 and 2723, not specifically mentioned above.




Section 5.12  Authentic Evidence.  Any and all declarations of facts made by authentic act before a notary public in the presence of two witnesses by a person declaring that such facts lie within his knowledge, shall constitute authentic evidence of such facts for the purpose of executory process.  Mortgagor specifically agrees that such an affidavit by a representative of Lender as to the existence, amount, terms, and maturity of the Indebtedness and of a default thereunder shall constitute authentic evidence of such facts for the purpose of executory process.




Section 5.13  Assemble Collateral.  For the purpose of enforcing any and all rights and remedies under this Mortgage Lender may (a) require Mortgagor to, and Mortgagor agrees that it will, at its expense and upon the request of Lender, forthwith assemble all or any part of the Collateral as directed by Lender and make it available at a place designated by Lender which is, in its opinion, reasonably convenient to Lender and Mortgagor, whether at the premises of Mortgagor or otherwise, and Lender shall be entitled to specific performance of this obligation; (b) to the extent permitted by applicable law of this or any other state, enter, with or without process of law and without breach of the peace, any premise where any of the Collateral is or may be located, and without charge or liability to it seize and remove such Collateral from such premises; (c) have access to and use Mortgagor's books and records relating to the Collateral; and (d) prior to the disposition of the Collateral, store or transfer it without charge in or by means of any storage or transportation facility owned or leased by Mortgagor, process, repair, or recondition it or otherwise prepare it for disposition in any manner and to the extent Lender deems appropriate and, in connection with such preparation and disposition use without charge any trademark, trade name, copyright, patent, or technical process used by Mortgagor.




Section 5.14  Litigation on Duty of Lender..  Beyond the exercise of reasonable care in the custody thereof, Lender shall have no duty as to any Collateral in its possession or control or in the possession or control of any agent or bailee or any income thereon.  Lender shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody of the Collateral in its possession if the Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which it accords its own property, and shall not be liable or responsible for any loss or damage to any of the Collateral, or for any diminution in the value thereof, by reason of the act or omission of any warehouseman, carrier, forwarding agency, consignee, or other agent or bailee selected by Lender in good faith.




  



  






 



Section 5.15  Appointment of Agent.  At any time or times, in order to comply with any legal requirement in any jurisdiction, Lender may appoint a bank or trust company or one or more other Persons with such power and authority as may be necessary for the effectual operation of the provisions hereof and may be specified in the instrument of appointment.

SECURITY AGREEMENT, AND FINANCING STATEMENT




Introduction to Description of Mineral Properties




Mortgagor and Lender hereby agree and affirm that this Introduction to Description of Properties is an amplification and explanation of the terminology, format, and information contained in Exhibit A and that this instrument shall be construed as a whole with reference to the entirety of its provisions (including all Exhibits).




1.           This instrument covers Mortgagor's entire interest in each of the mineral servitudes, mineral leases, mineral royalties, and other mineral rights described in Exhibit A, as now owned or as hereafter acquired.  The inclusion of Mortgagor’s “Revenue Interests,” “Expense Interests,” and undivided leasehold interests, by the listing of percentage, decimal, or fractional numbers or otherwise, as well as the inclusion of depth limitations, spacing unit designations and agreements, well names and well arabic numbers, are in some instances for purposes of certain representations of Mortgagor contained in this instrument and are generally for descriptive purposes.  The inclusion (or the inaccuracy thereof) of this information is not in any way a limitation or restriction on the interest of Mortgagor being subjected to the lien and encumbrance of this instrument.  In the event that Mortgagor acquires additional undivided interests in some or all of such mineral rights, this Mortgage shall automatically encumber such additions or increases to Mortgagor's interest in such mineral rights without need of further act or document.




2.           This instrument is intended to cover the entire interest of Mortgagor in any lease described in Exhibit A.  Reference is made to the land descriptions contained in the documents of title recorded as described in Exhibit A.




3.           References in Exhibit A to instruments on file in the public records are made for all purposes. Unless provided otherwise, all recording references in Exhibit A are to the official real property records of the parish or parishes in which the mortgaged property is located and in which records such documents are or in the past have been customarily recorded, whether Conveyance Records, Deed Records, Oil and Gas Records, Mineral Lease Records, Oil and Gas Lease Records, or other records.




4.           A statement herein that a certain interest described is subject to the terms of certain described or referred to agreements, instruments, or other matters shall not operate to subject such interest to any such agreement, instrument, or other matter except to the extent that such agreement, instrument, or matter is otherwise valid and presently subsisting nor shall such statement be deemed to constitute a recognition by the parties hereto that any such agreement, instrument, or other matter is valid and presently subsisting or binding against Lender.
