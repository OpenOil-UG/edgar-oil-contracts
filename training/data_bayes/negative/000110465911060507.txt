AWARD AGREEMENT
 
1.                                       Grant of Restricted Stock.  The Company grants you Restricted Stock as set forth in the foregoing Notice of Grant.  The Restricted Stock may be evidenced in the manner the Company deems appropriate, including, without limitation, a book-entry registration or issuance of a stock certificate or certificates.
 
2.                                       Restriction Period.  Except as otherwise provided in sections 3(a) and 4 below, the Restriction Period will end five years from the date of grant.  You may not sell, assign, transfer (by gift or otherwise), pledge, hypothecate, or otherwise dispose of, by operation of law or otherwise, any of the Shares prior to the end of the Restriction Period.
 
3.                                       Termination of Employment.
 
(a)                                  Death or Disability.  If your employment with the Company terminates on account of death or disability (as defined below), the Restriction Period will end and the Restricted Stock will be fully vested and payable.
 
You will be considered disabled if you are (i) unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months, or (ii) by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months, receiving income replacement benefits for a period of not less than three months under an accident and health plan covering employees of the Company.
 
(b)                                 Other Terminations.  If your employment with the Company terminates prior to the end of the Restriction Period for any reason other than death or disability, whether or not your termination is voluntary or involuntary, your Restricted Stock will be forfeited, and you must immediately transfer and assign to the Company, without any consideration, all Restricted Stock, and you may not exercise any of the privileges or rights of a stockholder with respect to the Restricted Stock.
 
4.                                       Change of Control.  Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Event, as defined in the Plan, the Restriction Period will end and the Restricted Stock will be fully vested and payable.
 
5.                                       Removal of Restrictions.  Upon vesting of the Restricted Stock, the Company will deliver shares of common stock to you.  In conformity with its insider trading policy, the Company may elect to electronically deliver the shares to your account at a brokerage firm selected by the Company.
 
6.                                       Withholding Taxes.  Unless you make other arrangements with the Company, the Company will withhold a number of shares of common stock having a Fair Market Value (as defined in the Plan) on the date of payment equal to the minimum statutory total tax which could be withheld on the transaction.  You may also make arrangements with the Company to pay the amount of taxes required by law or to deliver to the Company previously owned shares of common stock having a Fair Market Value on the date of payment equal to the minimum statutory total tax.  In no event will any form of payment made by you be permitted if it would result in an accounting charge with respect to shares delivered to pay such taxes, unless otherwise approved by the Committee.
 
7.                                       Effect of Prohibited Transfer.  If any transfer of Restricted Stock is made or attempted to be made contrary to the terms of this Agreement, the Company will have the right to acquire, without the payment of any consideration, such shares from you or your transferee, at any time before or after a

prohibited transfer.  In addition to any other legal or equitable remedies it may have, the Company may enforce its rights to specific performance to the extent permitted by law and may exercise such other equitable remedies then available to it.  The Company may refuse for any purpose to recognize any transferee who receives shares contrary to the provisions of this Agreement as a stockholder and may retain and/or recover all dividends on such shares that were paid or payable subsequent to the date on which the prohibited transfer was made or attempted.
 
8.                                       Rights as a Stockholder.  During the Restriction Period, you will have the right to receive dividends and to vote the shares of Restricted Stock.  If any dividends or distributions are paid in shares of Common Stock, all of these shares will be subject to the same restrictions on transferability as the shares of Restricted Stock with respect to which they were paid.
 
9.                                       Miscellaneous.
