Re:           Earn-In Respecting PEL 112 and PEL 444

 

Dear Sir:

 

This letter (the “LOI”) sets out our intention to complete a transaction (the “Transaction”) between Terra Nova Minerals Inc. (“Terra Nova”) and Holloman Energy Corporation (“Holloman”) through which Terra Nova will have the right to earn a 55% working interest (the “Farm-In Interest”) in two onshore Petroleum Exploration Licenses (individually a “License” or jointly the  “Licenses”) located on the western flank of the Cooper Basin in the State of South Australia, Australia, namely PEL 112 (comprised of 2,196 square kilometers) and PEL 444 (comprised of 2,358 square kilometers), on the terms and conditions set forth herein. Terra Nova and Holloman are to be known individually as a “Party” and jointly as the “Parties” under this LOI.

 

The Transaction is expressly subject to:

 





(a)


a due diligence review by each Party of the other Party, including such other Party’s business, operations, properties and title thereto;




 





(b)


the negotiation, execution and delivery of a definitive earn-in agreement for the Transaction (the “Definitive Agreement”) among the Parties;




 





(c)


the approval of the Transaction by the board of directors of each of the Parties;




 





(d)


the pro-rata working interest participation in the Transaction by Australian-Canadian Oil Royalties Ltd. and Eli Sakhai, each of whom are current owners of a 16.67% interest in the Licenses;




 





(e)


the approval of the Transaction by the TSX Venture Exchange (the “Exchange”) or any other stock exchange or regulatory body applicable having jurisdiction or authority over either of the Parties.




 



  



 







  



 





1.


Non-Refundable Fee and Shares




 

1.1 On execution of this LOI, Terra Nova shall pay to Holloman an initial, non-refundable fee (the “Fee”) in the amount of USD$100,000, which Fee shall not be repayable or repaid by Holloman to Terra Nova under any circumstances.

 

1.2 Within ten Business Days of the effective date of the Definitive Agreement, Terra Nova shall issue to Holloman 1,000,000 common shares (the “Shares”) of Terra Nova, it being acknowledged and agreed that such Shares will be subject to a hold period of four months and a day in accordance with the policies of the Exchange and applicable securities laws.

 





2.  


Transaction




 

2.1      The Parties will only be legally bound to complete the Transaction upon execution of the Definitive Agreement incorporating the terms and conditions of this LOI.  The Parties agree to negotiate the Definitive Agreement in good faith with the goal of executing the Definitive Agreement within 30 days of the date of execution of this LOI.  The Parties further acknowledge that the Definitive Agreement will incorporate the principal terms of the Transaction contemplated herein and will also contain customary provisions typical for transactions and agreements of this type, including but not limited to a standard right of first refusal for any future disposition of an interest by a Party in the Licenses.  The principal terms of the Transaction under which Terra Nova will have the right to earn the Farm-In Interest in each of PEL 112 and PEL 444 are as follows:

 

1. Seismic Earning Obligations:

 





(a)


Within 15 days from the execution of this LOI, Terra Nova shall pay into the trust account of Holloman’s solicitors USD$250,000, which, upon execution of the Definitive Agreement, will be transferred to Holloman for its unrestricted use. In the event a Definitive Agreement is not executed between the Parties, such amount will be refunded to Terra Nova;




 





(b)


Within 15 days from the execution of this LOI, Terra Nova shall pay into the trust account of such solicitors as may be selected by the mutual consent of the Parties AUD$4,000,000 which, upon the execution of the Definitive Agreement, will be used by Terra Nova in the completion of a seismic acquisition program, including work area clearance and seismic interpretation, on both PEL 112 and PEL 444 (the “Initial Seismic Program”). At a minimum, the scope of the Initial Seismic Work Program shall be sufficient to cover the seismic acquisition requirements for both Licenses as set forth in their respective license conditions.  In the event a Definitive Agreement is not executed between the Parties, such amount will be refunded to Terra Nova;




 





(c)


On or before May 1, 2012, Terra Nova shall pay into the trust account of such solicitors as may be selected by the mutual consent of the Parties, AUD$700,000 for use by Terra Nova to complete the Initial Seismic Program.




 



  



2







  



 

The earning obligations listed in Articles 2.1(a) to 2.1(c) are collectively referred to as the “Seismic Earning Obligations”. Seismic data obtained during performance of the Seismic Earning Obligations shall be the property of all Parties to be held in working interest percentages calculated as though Terra Nova had successfully completed its Seismic Earning Obligations and Drilling Obligations.

 

In the event Terra Nova’s costs to complete the Seismic Earning Obligations is less than the amounts escrowed in Articles 2.1(b) and 2.1(c), such excess escrowed funds shall continue in escrow for use in the pursuit of whatever exploration activities upon the Licenses as may be agreed by the Parties, until June 13, 2013.

 

Upon final funding of the Seismic Earning Obligations for a License, Holloman agrees to transfer to Terra Nova, and register in its favour, a 20% working interest in such License (the “Seismic Working Interest”). Terra Nova shall hold the Seismic Working Interest on each License in trust and for the sole benefit of Holloman until the seismic program for that License is complete. For greater clarity, the Seismic Working Interest shall be earned by Terra Nova on a License by License basis such that the completion of a seismic program on PEL 444 shall earn Terra Nova its Seismic Working Interest in PEL 444 and completion of a seismic program on PEL 112 shall earn Terra Nova its Seismic Working Interest in PEL 112.

 

During such period that Terra Nova holds the Seismic Working Interest on either License for the benefit of Holloman, Terra Nova shall indemnify and save harmless Holloman from and against all actions, claims, demands, losses, damages, costs and expenses (including all legal and other professional charges on a full solicitor/client indemnity basis) and other liability whatsoever which may be incurred, suffered or sustained by Holloman in connection with any act or omission of Terra Nova in connection with the Licenses.

 

Earning Obligations - Drilling

 





(d)  


On or before November 1, 2012, Terra Nova shall pay into the trust account of such solicitors as may be selected by the mutual consent of the Parties, AUD$4,500,000, which will be used by Terra Nova to conduct a three (3) well drill program on the Licenses (the “Initial Drilling Program”). Well locations drilled during the Initial Drilling Program shall be selected by Terra Nova except that at a minimum of one well must be drilled on each of the Licenses.  In connection with the Initial Drilling Program, Terra Nova shall solely fund dry-hole costs of the three wells. In the event Initial Drilling Program dry-hole costs exceed an aggregate amount of AUD$4,500,000, such excess cost shall be borne solely by Terra Nova. In the event any well drilled as part of the Initial Drilling Program shall test positively for commercially viable production of oil or gas, Terra Nova shall pay 50% of the total aggregate completion costs respecting such well(s) and the current working interest holders shall pay 50% of the total aggregate completion costs respecting such well(s) in accordance with their respective current working interests.




 





(e)  


At the option of Terra Nova, on or before March 1, 2013, Terra Nova may pay into the trust account of such solicitors as may be selected by the mutual consent of the Parties, AUD$4,500,000, which will be used by Terra Nova to conduct an additional three (3) well drill program on the Licenses (the “Optional Drilling Program”). Well locations drilled during the Optional Drilling Program shall be selected by Terra Nova except that at a minimum of one well must be drilled on each of the Licenses.  In connection with the Optional Drilling Program, Terra Nova shall solely fund (up to an aggregate amount of AUD$4,500,000) dry-hole costs of the three wells. In the event any well drilled as part of the Optional Drilling Program shall test positively for commercially viable production of oil or gas, Terra Nova shall pay 50% of the total aggregate completion costs respecting such well(s) and the current working interest holders shall pay 50% of the total aggregate completion costs respecting such well(s) in accordance with their respective current working interests.

The earning obligations listed in Articles 2.1(d) to 2.1(e) are collectively referred to as the “Drilling Obligations”.

 

Upon drilling and abandonment or completion of each well constituting the Initial Drilling Program, Terra Nova shall be deemed to have earned an additional 5.8333% working interest (a total 17.5% working interest in the event the entire Initial Drilling Program is completed)  in each of the Licenses (the “Initial Well Working Interests”). Upon completion of the Initial Drilling Program, or in the event Terra Nova fails to complete the Initial Drilling Program on or before June 1, 2013, Holloman agrees to transfer to Terra Nova, and register in its favour a working interest percentage equal to the total of the Initial Well Working Interests earned during the Initial Drilling Program.

Upon completion of the Optional Drilling Program, or in the event Terra Nova fails, or determines not to complete the Optional Drilling Program on or before June 1, 2014, Holloman agrees to transfer to Terra Nova, and register in its favour a working interest percentage equal to the total of the Optional Well Working Interests earned during the Optional Drilling Program.

 

Holloman shall hold the Initial Well Working Interests and Optional Well Working Interests on each License in trust and for the sole benefit of Terra Nova until the applicable drilling program is completed or terminated. During such period Holloman shall indemnify and save harmless Terra Nova from and against all actions, claims, demands, losses, damages, costs and expenses (including all legal and other professional charges on a full solicitor/client indemnity basis) and other liability whatsoever which may be incurred, suffered or sustained by Terra Nova in connection with any act or omission of Holloman in connection with the Licenses.

2.4      In the event any well drilled in connection with the Initial Drilling Program or Optional Drilling Program is a commercially viable producer of petroleum substances (a “Successful Well”), Terra Nova shall be entitled to a preferential recovery of its dry-hole costs relating to that Successful Well (a “Successful Well Cost Recovery”). Successful Well Cost Recovery payments to Terra Nova shall be calculated as eighty (80%) percent of net revenues accruing to  Holloman’s then working interest in all petroleum substances produced and sold from such Successful Well (“Net Revenues”). Successful Well Cost Recovery payments shall be paid on a Successful Well by Successful Well basis until either:

 





(a)


Such Successful Well has ceased production and is subsequently abandoned; or




 





(b)


Terra Nova has recovered its entire dry hole costs related to such Successful Well.
