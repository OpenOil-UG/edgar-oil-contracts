Except as provided in Section 4.5, no Option, SAR, grant of Restricted Stock or other Award under the Plan shall be transferable other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Any Option or SAR shall be exercisable (i) during

granted under the Plan, that the original recipient of such Award may transfer all or a portion of such Option or SAR to an immediate family member of such recipient who acquires the Option or SAR from the original recipient through a gift or a
qualified domestic relations court order. For purposes of this Section 4.5, family member includes any child, stepchild, grandchild, parent, stepparent, grandparent, spouse, sibling, mother-in-law,
father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law or sister-in-law, including adoptive relationships, trusts for the exclusive benefit of these persons and any other entity owned solely by these persons, provided that the Award Agreement
for such Option or SAR expressly provides that subsequent transfers of such Option or SAR by the family member shall be prohibited except in accordance with Section 4.4. Following transfer, any such Option or SAR shall continue to be subject to
the same terms and conditions as were applicable immediately prior to transfer, including all vesting and forfeiture provisions including those arising as a result of a Termination of Employment, as applicable, which shall continue to be applied
with respect to the original recipient of the Option or SAR, following which the Option or SAR shall be exercisable by the family member only to the extent and for the periods specified in the Award Agreement for such Award.  
4.6 Requirements of Law. The Company shall not be required to sell or issue any shares of Stock under any Award if issuing those
shares of Stock would constitute or result in a violation by the Holder or the Company of any provision of any law, statute or regulation of any governmental authority. Specifically, in connection with any applicable statute or regulation relating
to the registration of securities, upon exercise of any Option or pursuant to any other Award, the Company shall not be required to issue any shares of Stock unless the Committee has received evidence satisfactory to it to the effect that the Holder
will not transfer the shares of Stock except in accordance with applicable law, including receipt of an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Company to the effect that any proposed transfer complies with applicable law. The determination by the
Committee on this matter shall be final, binding and conclusive. The Company may, but shall in no event be obligated to, register any shares of Stock covered by the Plan pursuant to applicable securities laws of any country or any political
subdivision. In the event the shares of Stock issuable on exercise of an Option or pursuant to any other Award are not registered, the Company may imprint on the certificate evidencing the shares of Stock any legend that counsel for the Company
considers necessary or advisable to comply with applicable law, or, should the shares of Stock be represented by book or electronic entry rather than a certificate, the Company may take such steps to restrict transfer of the shares of Stock as
counsel for the Company considers necessary or advisable to comply with applicable law. The Company shall not be obligated to take any other affirmative action in order to cause or enable the exercise of an Option or any other Award, or the issuance
of shares of Stock pursuant thereto, to comply with any law or regulation of any governmental authority.

 4.7 Changes in the Companys Capital Structure.  
(a) The existence of outstanding Awards shall not affect in any way the right or power of the Company or its stockholders to make or authorize
any or all adjustments, recapitalizations, reorganizations or other changes in the Companys capital structure or its business, any merger or consolidation of the Company, any issue of bonds, debentures, preferred or prior preference shares
ahead of or affecting the Stock or Stock rights, the dissolution or liquidation of the Company, any sale or transfer of all or any part of its assets or business or any other corporate act or proceeding, whether of a similar character or otherwise.
 (b) If the Company shall effect a subdivision or consolidation of Stock or other capital readjustment, the payment of a Stock dividend,
or other increase or reduction of the number of shares of Stock outstanding, without receiving compensation therefore in money, services or property, then (1) the number and per share price of Stock subject to outstanding Options or other
Awards under the Plan shall be appropriately adjusted (subject to the restriction in Section 4.12 prohibiting repricing) in such a manner as to entitle a Holder to receive upon exercise of an Option or other Award, for the same aggregate cash
consideration, the equivalent total number of Stock the Holder would have received had the Holder exercised his or her Option or other Award in full immediately prior to the event requiring the adjustment, and (2) the number of Stock then
reserved to be issued under the Plan shall be adjusted by substituting for the total number of Stock then reserved that number of Stock that would have been received by the owner of an equal number of outstanding shares of Stock as the result of the
event requiring the adjustment.  (c) If while unexercised Options or other Awards remain outstanding under the Plan (1) the
Company shall not be the surviving entity in any merger, consolidation or other reorganization (or survives only as a subsidiary of an entity other than an entity that was wholly-owned by the Company immediately prior to such merger, consolidation
or other reorganization), (2) the Company sells, leases or exchanges or agrees to sell, lease or exchange all or substantially all of its assets to any other person or entity (other than an entity wholly-owned by the Company), (3) the
Company is to be dissolved or (4) the Company is a party to any other corporate transaction (as defined under section 424(a) of the Code and applicable Department of Treasury regulations) that is not described in clauses (1), (2) or
(3) of this sentence (each such event is referred to herein as a Corporate Change), then, except as otherwise provided in an Award Agreement or another agreement between the Holder and the Company (provided that such
exceptions shall not apply in the case of a reincorporation merger), or as a result of the Committees effectuation of one or more of the alternatives described below, there shall be no acceleration of the time at which any Award then
outstanding may be exercised, and no later than ten days after the approval by the stockholders of the Company of such Corporate Change, the Committee, acting in its sole and absolute discretion without the consent or approval of any Holder, shall
act to effect one or more of the following alternatives, which may vary among individual Holders and which may vary among Awards held by any individual Holder (provided that, with respect to a reincorporation merger in which Holders of the
Companys ordinary shares will receive one ordinary share of the successor corporation for each ordinary share of the Company, none of such alternatives shall apply and, without Committee action, each Award shall automatically convert into a
similar award of the successor corporation exercisable for the same number of ordinary shares of the successor as the Award was exercisable for ordinary shares of Stock of the Company):  
   - 9 - 





 (1) accelerate the time at which some or all of the Awards then outstanding may be exercised so
that such Awards may be exercised in full for a limited period of time on or before a specified date (before or after such Corporate Change) fixed by the Committee, after which specified date all such Awards that remain unexercised and all rights of
Holders under such Awards shall terminate;  (2) require the mandatory surrender to the Company by all or selected Holders of some or all
of the then outstanding Awards held by such Holders (irrespective of whether such Awards are then exercisable under the provisions of the Plan or the applicable Award Agreement evidencing such Award) as of a date, before or after such Corporate
Change, specified by the Committee, in which event the Committee shall thereupon cancel such Award and the Company shall pay to each such Holder an amount of cash per share equal to the excess, if any, of the per share price offered to stockholders
of the Company in connection with such Corporate Change over the exercise prices under such Award for such shares;  (3) with respect to
all or selected Holders, have some or all of their then outstanding Awards (whether vested or unvested) assumed or have a new award of a similar nature substituted for some or all of their then outstanding Awards under the Plan (whether vested or
unvested) by an entity which is a party to the transaction resulting in such Corporate Change and which is then employing such Holder or which is affiliated or associated with such Holder in the same or a substantially similar manner as the Company
prior to the Corporate Change, or a parent or subsidiary of such entity, provided that (A) such assumption or substitution is on a basis where the excess of the aggregate fair market value of the Stock subject to the Award immediately after the
assumption or substitution over the aggregate exercise price of such Stock is equal to the excess of the aggregate fair market value of all Stock subject to the Award immediately before such assumption or substitution over the aggregate exercise
price of such Stock, and (B) the assumed rights under such existing Award or the substituted rights under such new Award, as the case may be, will have the same terms and conditions as the rights under the existing Award assumed or substituted
for, as the case may be;  (4) provide that the number of Stock covered by an Award (whether vested or unvested) theretofore granted shall
be adjusted so that such Award when exercised shall thereafter cover the number of Stock or other securities or property (including, without limitation, cash) to which the Holder would have been entitled pursuant to the terms of the agreement or
plan relating to such Corporate Change if, immediately prior to such Corporate Change, the Holder had been the holder of record of the number of shares of Stock then covered by such Award; or 
(5) make such adjustments to Awards then outstanding as the Committee deems appropriate to reflect such Corporate Change (provided, however,
that the Committee may determine in its sole and absolute discretion that no such adjustment is necessary).  In effecting one or more of
the alternatives set out in paragraphs (3), (4) or (5) immediately above, and except as otherwise may be provided in an Award Agreement, the Committee, in its sole and absolute discretion and without the consent or approval of any Holder,
may accelerate the time at which some or all Awards then outstanding may be exercised. 
   - 10 - 





 (d) In the event of changes in the outstanding Stock by reason of recapitalizations,
reorganizations, mergers, consolidations, combinations, exchanges or other relevant changes in capitalization occurring after the date of the grant of any Award and not otherwise provided for by this Section 4.7, any outstanding Award and any
Award Agreement evidencing such Award shall be subject to adjustment by the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion as to the number and price of Stock or other consideration subject to such Award. In the event of any such change in the
outstanding Stock, the aggregate number of shares of Stock available under the Plan may be appropriately adjusted by the Committee, whose determination shall be conclusive. 
(e) After a merger of one or more corporations into the Company or after a consolidation of the Company and one or more corporations in which
the Company shall be the surviving corporation, each Holder shall be entitled to have his Restricted Stock appropriately adjusted based on the manner in which the shares of Stock were adjusted under the terms of the agreement of merger or
consolidation.  (f) The issuance by the Company of stock of any class or series, or securities convertible into, or exchangeable for,
stock of any class or series, for cash or property, or for labor or services either upon direct sale or upon the exercise of rights or warrants to subscribe for them, or upon conversion or exchange of stock or obligations of the Company convertible
into, or exchangeable for, stock or other securities, shall not affect, and no adjustment by reason of such issuance shall be made with respect to, the number, class or series, or price of shares of Stock then subject to outstanding Options or other
Awards.  4.8 Election Under Section 83(b) of the Code. No Holder shall exercise the election permitted under section
83(b) of the Code with respect to any Award without the prior written approval of the Chief Financial Officer of the Company. Any Holder who makes an election under section 83(b) of the Code with respect to any Award without the prior written
approval of the Chief Financial Officer of the Company may, in the discretion of the Committee, forfeit any or all Awards granted to him or her under the Plan.  
4.9 Forfeiture for Cause. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or an Award Agreement, if the Committee finds by a
majority vote that a Holder, before or after his Termination of Employment or severance of affiliation relationship with the Company and all Affiliates, (a) committed fraud, embezzlement, theft, felony or an act of dishonesty in the course of
his employment by or affiliation with the Company or an Affiliate which conduct damaged the Company or an Affiliate, (b) disclosed trade secrets of the Company or an Affiliate or (c) violated the terms of any non-competition,
non-disclosure or similar agreement with respect to the Company or any Affiliate to which the Holder is a party, then as of the date the Committee makes its finding some or all Awards awarded to the Holder (including vested Awards that have been
exercised, vested Awards that have not been exercised and Awards that have not yet vested), as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, and all net proceeds realized with respect to any such Awards, will be forfeited to the Company on
such terms as determined by the Committee. The findings and decision of the Committee with respect to such matter, including those regarding the acts of the Holder and the damage done to the Company, will be final for all purposes. No decision of
the Committee, however, will affect the finality of the discharge of the individual by the Company or an Affiliate or severance of the individuals affiliation with the Company and all Affiliates.  
   - 11 - 





 4.10 Forfeiture Events. The Committee may specify in an Award Agreement that the
Holders rights, payments, and benefits with respect to an Award shall be subject to reduction, cancellation, forfeiture, or recoupment upon the occurrence of certain specified events, in addition to any otherwise applicable vesting or
performance conditions of an Award. Such events may include, but shall not be limited to, Termination of Employment for cause, termination of the Holders provision of services to the Company or its Affiliates, violation of material policies of
the Company and its Affiliates, breach of noncompetition, confidentiality, or other restrictive covenants that may apply to the Holder, or other conduct by the Holder that is detrimental to the business or reputation of the Company and its
Affiliates.   4.11 Award Agreements. Each Award shall be embodied in a written or electronic Award Agreement that
shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan. The Award Agreement shall be signed or issued by an executive officer of the Company, other than the Holder, on behalf of the Company, and may be signed by the Holder to the extent required
by the Committee. The Award Agreement may specify the effect of a change in control of the Company on the Award. The Award Agreement may contain any other provisions that the Committee in its discretion shall deem advisable which are not
inconsistent with the terms and provisions of the Plan.   4.12 Amendments of Award Agreements. The terms of any
outstanding Award under the Plan may be amended from time to time by the Committee in its discretion in any manner that it deems appropriate and that is consistent with the terms of the Plan or that is necessary to implement the requirements of the
Plan. However, no such amendment shall adversely affect in a material manner any right of a Holder without his or her written consent. Except as specified in Section 4.7(b), the Committee may not directly or indirectly lower the exercise price
of a previously granted Option or the grant price of a previously granted SAR.   4.13 Rights as Stockholder. A Holder
shall not have any rights as a stockholder with respect to Stock covered by an Option, a SAR, an RSU or a Performance Unit Award payable in Stock until the date, if any, such Stock is issued by the Company; and, except as otherwise provided in
Section 4.7, no adjustment for dividends, or otherwise, shall be made if the record date therefore is prior to the date of issuance of such Stock.  
4.14 Issuance of Shares of Stock. Shares of Stock, when issued, may be represented by a certificate or by book or electronic
entry.   4.15 Restrictions on Stock Received. The Committee may impose such conditions and/or restrictions on any
shares of Stock issued pursuant to an Award as it may deem advisable or desirable. These restrictions may include, but shall not be limited to, a requirement that the Holder hold the shares of Stock for a specified period of time.  
4.16 Compliance With Section 409A. Awards shall be designed, granted and administered in such a manner that they are either
exempt from the application of, or comply with, the requirements of Section 409A. The Plan and each Award Agreement under the Plan that is intended to comply the requirements of Section 409A shall be construed and interpreted in accordance
with such intent. If the Committee determines that an Award, Award Agreement, payment, distribution, deferral election, transaction, or any other action or arrangement  
   - 12 - 





 
contemplated by the provisions of the Plan would, if undertaken, cause a Holder to become subject to additional taxes under Section 409A, then unless the Committee specifically provides
otherwise, such Award, Award Agreement, payment, distribution, deferral election, transaction or other action or arrangement shall not be given effect to the extent it causes such result and the related provisions of the Plan and/or Award Agreement
will be deemed modified, or, if necessary, suspended in order to comply with the requirements of Section 409A to the extent determined appropriate by the Committee, in each case without the consent of or notice to the Holder. The exercisability
of an Option or a SAR shall not be extended to the extent that such extension would subject the Holder to additional taxes under Section 409A. 
4.17 Source of Shares Deliverable Under Awards. Any shares of Stock delivered pursuant to an Award may consist, in whole or in
part, of authorized and unissued shares of Stock or of treasury shares of Stock.   4.18 Date of Grant. The date on
which an Option or SAR is granted shall be the date the Company completes the corporate action constituting an offer of stock for sale to a Holder under the terms and conditions of the Option or SAR; provided that such corporate
action shall not be considered complete until the date on which the maximum number of shares that can be purchased under the Option and the minimum Option price are fixed or determinable. If the corporate action contemplates an
immediate offer of Stock for sale to a class of individuals, then the date of the granting of an Option is the time or date of that corporate action, if the offer is to be made immediately. If the corporate action contemplates a particular date on
which the offer is to be made, then the date of grant is the contemplated date of the offer.   ARTICLE V 
OPTIONS  5.1
Authority to Grant Options. Subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan, the Committee, at any time, and from time to time, may grant Options under the Plan to eligible persons in such number and upon such terms as the Committee shall
determine; provided that ISOs may be granted only to eligible Employees of the Company or of any Parent Corporation or Subsidiary Corporation (as permitted by section 422 of the Code and the regulations thereunder).  
5.2 Type of Options Available. Options granted under the Plan may be NSOs or ISOs.  
5.3 Option Agreement. Each Option grant under the Plan shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement that shall specify
(a) whether the Option is intended to be an ISO or an NSO, (b) the Option Price, (c) the duration of the Option, (d) the number of shares of Stock to which the Option pertains, (e) the exercise restrictions applicable to the
Option and (f) such other provisions as the Committee shall determine that are not inconsistent with the terms and provisions of the Plan. Notwithstanding the designation of an Option as an ISO in the applicable Award Agreement for such Option,
to the extent the limitations of Section 5.10 of the Plan are exceeded with respect to the Option, the portion of the Option in excess of the limitation shall be treated as a NSO. An Option granted under the Plan may not be granted with any
Dividend Equivalents rights.  
   - 13 - 





 5.4 Option Price. The price at which shares of Stock may be purchased under an
Option (the Option Price) shall not be less than 100 percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of the shares of Stock on the date the Option is granted. However, in the case of a Ten Percent Stockholder, the
Option Price for an ISO shall not be less than 110 percent (110%) of the Fair Market Value of the shares of Stock on the date the ISO is granted. Subject to the limitations set forth in the preceding sentences of this Section 5.4, the
Committee shall determine the Option Price for each grant of an Option under the Plan.   5.5 Duration of Option. An
Option shall not be exercisable after the earlier of (a) the general term of the Option specified in the applicable Award Agreement (which shall not exceed five years) or (b) the period of time specified in the applicable Award Agreement
that follows the Holders Termination of Employment or severance of affiliation relationship with the Company. Unless the applicable Award Agreement specifies a shorter term, in the case of an ISO granted to a Ten Percent Stockholder, the
Option shall expire on the fifth anniversary of the date the Option is granted.   5.6 Amount Exercisable. Each Option
may be exercised at the time, in the manner and subject to the conditions the Committee specifies in the Award Agreement in its sole discretion.  
5.7 Payment For Shares. The Option Price of an Option shall be paid to the Company in full at the time of exercise. Unless
otherwise required by the Committee at the time an Option is granted and except as provided below, the Optionee may elect to make payment (a) in cash, (b) in shares of Stock having a Fair Market Value on the date of exercise equal to the
aggregate Option Price under the Option if approved in advance by the Committee or an executive officer of the Company and satisfying such other requirements as may be imposed by the Committee, (c) partly in accordance with each of clauses
(a) and (b), (d) as authorized by the Committee, through the withholding of shares of Stock (which would otherwise be delivered to the Optionee) with an aggregate Fair Market Value on the exercise date equal to the aggregate exercise price
of the Option or (e) through the delivery of irrevocable instructions to a broker to deliver promptly to the Company an amount equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Option. If shares of Stock are used for payment by the Optionee, the
aggregate Fair Market Value of the shares of Stock tendered must be equal to or less than the aggregate Option Price of the shares of Stock being purchased upon exercise of the Option, and any difference must be paid by cash, certified check, or
bank draft payable to the order of the Company. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, the Committee may limit the extent to which shares of Stock may be used to pay the Option Price and/or any withholding taxes payable in connection
with an exercise of an Option. An Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a share of Stock. No Optionee shall have any rights to dividends or other rights of a stockholder with respect to shares of Stock subject to an Option until the Optionee
has given written notice of exercise of the Option, paid in full for such shares of Stock and, if applicable, has satisfied any other conditions imposed by the Committee pursuant to the Plan.  
5.8 TransferabilityIncentive Stock Options. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or an Award Agreement to the contrary, no
ISO granted under the Plan may be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and all ISOs granted to an Employee under this Article V shall be
exercisable during his or her lifetime only by such Employee.  
   - 14 - 





 5.9 Notification of Disqualifying Disposition. If any Optionee shall make any
disposition of shares of Stock issued pursuant to the exercise of an ISO under the circumstances described in section 421(b) of the Code (relating to certain disqualifying dispositions), such Optionee shall notify the Company of such disposition
within ten (10) days thereof.   5.10 No Rights as Stockholder. An Optionee shall not have any rights as a
stockholder with respect to Stock covered by an Option until the date a stock certificate for such Stock is issued by the Company; and, except as otherwise provided in Section 4.7, no adjustment for dividends, or otherwise, shall be made if the
record date therefore is prior to the date of issuance of such certificate.   5.11 $100,000 Limitation on ISOs. To
the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of Stock with respect to which ISOs first become exercisable by a Holder in any calendar year exceeds $100,000, taking into account both shares of Stock subject to ISOs under the Plan and Stock subject
to ISOs under all other plans of the Company, such Options shall be treated as NSOs. For this purpose, the Fair Market Value of the Stock subject to Options shall be determined as of the date the Options were awarded. In reducing the
number of Options treated as ISOs to meet the $100,000 limit, the most recently granted Options shall be reduced first. To the extent a reduction of simultaneously granted Options is necessary to meet the $100,000 limit, the Committee may, in the
manner and to the extent permitted by law, designate which shares of Stock are to be treated as shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of an ISO.

SAR, which shall not be less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of one share of the Stock on the date of grant of the SAR. The grant price of a Freestanding SAR shall not be less than the Fair Market Value of a share of

 6.4 SAR Agreement. Each Award of SARs granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by
an Award Agreement that shall specify (a) whether the SAR is intended to be a Freestanding SAR or a Tandem SAR, (b) the grant price of the SAR, (c) the term of the SAR, (d) the vesting and termination provisions of the SAR and
(e) such other provisions as the Committee shall determine that are not inconsistent with the terms and provisions of the Plan. The Committee may impose such additional conditions or restrictions on the exercise of any SAR as it may deem

designated by the Committee stating (a) that the Holder wishes to exercise such SAR on the date such notice is so delivered, (b) the number of shares of Stock with respect to which the SAR is to be exercised and (c) the address to
which the payment due under such SAR should be delivered. In accordance with applicable law, a Freestanding SAR may be exercised upon whatever additional terms and conditions the Committee, in its sole discretion, imposes.  
6.7 Exercise of Tandem SARs. Subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan and the applicable Award Agreement, Tandem SARs may
be exercised for all or part of the shares of Stock subject to the related Option upon the surrender of the right to exercise the equivalent portion of the related Option and by the delivery of written notice in the manner designated by the
Committee stating (a) that the Holder wishes to exercise such SAR on the date such notice is so delivered, (b) the number of shares of Stock with respect to which the SAR is to be exercised and (c) the address to which the payment due
under such SAR should be delivered. A Tandem SAR may be exercised only with respect to the shares of Stock for which its related Option is then exercisable. In accordance with applicable law, a Tandem SAR may be exercised upon whatever additional
terms and conditions the Committee, in its sole discretion, imposes.   6.8 Payment of SAR Amount. Upon the exercise
of a SAR, a Holder shall be entitled to receive payment from the Company in an amount determined by multiplying the excess of the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the date of exercise over the grant price of the SAR by the number of shares
of Stock with respect to which the SAR is exercised. At the discretion of the Committee, the payment upon SAR exercise may be in cash, in Stock of equivalent value, in some combination thereof or in any other manner approved by the Committee in its
sole discretion. The Committees determination regarding the form of SAR payout shall be set forth in the Award Agreement pertaining to the grant of the SAR.

Award Agreement entered into with the Holder, need not be uniform among all SARs issued pursuant to the Plan, and may reflect distinctions based on the reasons for termination or severance.

Restricted Stock Award shall be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. If the Committee imposes vesting or transferability restrictions on a Holders rights with respect to Restricted Stock, the Committee may issue such
instructions to the Companys share transfer agent in connection therewith as it deems appropriate. The Committee may also cause the certificate for shares of Stock issued pursuant to a Restricted Stock Award to be imprinted with any legend

shares of Stock as counsel for the Company considers necessary or advisable to comply with applicable law.   7.2
Restricted Stock Award Agreement. Each Restricted Stock Award shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement that contains any vesting, transferability restrictions and other provisions not inconsistent with the Plan as the Committee may specify.

ARTICLE IX  PERFORMANCE
AWARDS  9.1 Authority to Grant Performance Awards. Subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan, the Committee, at
any time, and from time to time, may grant Performance Awards under the Plan to eligible persons in such amounts and upon such terms as the Committee shall determine. Such Awards may be in the form of performance stock (which is similar to

under Article VIII except vesting shall be based on the accomplishment of a Performance Goal) (Performance Unit Award) and such other form of award established by the Committee with vesting based on the
accomplishment of a Performance Goal. The amount of, the vesting and the transferability restrictions applicable to any Performance Award shall be based upon the attainment of such Performance Goals as the Committee may determine; provided, however,
that the performance period for any Performance Award shall not be less than one year. If the Committee imposes vesting or transferability restrictions on a Holders rights with respect to Performance Stock Awards, the Committee may issue such
instructions to the Companys share transfer agent in connection therewith as it deems appropriate. The Committee may also cause the certificate for shares of Stock issued pursuant to a Performance Award to be imprinted with any legend which

   - 18 - 





 9.2 Performance Goals. A Performance Goal must be objective such that a third party
having knowledge of the relevant facts could determine whether the goal is met. Such a Performance Goal may be based on one or more business criteria that apply to the Holder, one or more business units of the Company, or the Company as a whole,
with reference to one or more of the following: reserve additions, production and production growth, earnings per share, total shareholder return, cash return on capitalization, increased revenue, revenue ratios (per employee or per customer), net
income, stock price, market share, return on equity, return on assets, return on capital, return on capital compared to cost of capital, return on capital employed, return on invested capital, shareholder value, net cash flow, operating income,
earnings before interest and taxes, cash flow, cash flow from operations, and cost reductions. Goals may also be based on performance relative to a peer group of companies. Unless otherwise stated, such a Performance Goal need not be based upon an
increase or positive result under a particular business criterion and could include, for example, maintaining the status quo or limiting economic losses (measured, in each case, by reference to specific business criteria). Performance Goals may be
determined by including or excluding, in the Committees discretion, items that are determined to be extraordinary, unusual in nature, infrequent in occurrence, related to the disposal or acquisition of all or a segment of a business, or
related to a change in accounting principle, all as determined in accordance with standards established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 225-20, Income Statement, Extraordinary and Unusual
Items, and FASB ASC 830-10, Foreign Currency Matters, Overall, other applicable accounting rules, or consistent with Company accounting policies and practices in effect on the date the Performance Goal is established. In interpreting Plan provisions
applicable to Performance Goals and Performance Awards, it is intended that the Plan will conform with the standards of section 162(m) of the Code and Treasury Regulations § 1.162-27(e)(2)(i), and the Committee in establishing such goals and
interpreting the Plan shall be guided by such provisions. Prior to the payment of any compensation based on the achievement of Performance Goals, the Committee must certify in writing that applicable Performance Goals and any of the material terms
thereof were, in fact, satisfied. Subject to the foregoing provisions, the terms, conditions and limitations applicable to any Performance Awards made pursuant to the Plan shall be determined by the Committee.  
9.3 Time of Establishment of Performance Goals. A Performance Goal for a particular Performance Award must be established by the
Committee prior to the earlier to occur of (a) 90 days after the commencement of the period of service to which the Performance Goal relates or (b) the lapse of 25 percent of the period of service, and in any event while the outcome is
substantially uncertain.   9.4 Written Agreement. Each Performance Award shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement
that contains any vesting, transferability restrictions and other provisions not inconsistent with the Plan as the Committee may specify.

that is no later than the date that is two and one-half (2 1/2) months after the end of the calendar year in which the Performance Award payment is no longer subject to a Substantial Risk of Forfeiture or (b) at a time that is permissible under

Stock. A Holder of a Performance Award that is payable in shares of Stock shall have no rights of a stockholder with respect to such shares of Stock payable under such Performance Award until the underlying shares of Stock
are earned under the terms of such Performance Award.   9.8 Increases Prohibited. None of the Committee or the Board
may increase the amount of compensation payable under a Performance Award. If the time at which a Performance Award will vest or be paid is accelerated for any reason, the number of shares of Stock subject to, or the amount payable under, the
Performance Award shall be reduced pursuant to Department of Treasury Regulation § 1.162-27(e)(2)(iii) to reasonably reflect the time value of money.  
9.9 Stockholder Approval. No payments of Stock or cash will be made pursuant to this Article IX unless the stockholder approval
requirements of Department of Treasury Regulation § 1.162-27(e)(4) are satisfied.   9.10 Dividend Equivalents.
An Award Agreement for a Performance Award may specify that the Holder shall be entitled to the payment of Dividend Equivalents under the Award, but such Dividend Equivalents shall not be paid currently on unearned Performance Awards. Instead,
Dividend Equivalents on such unearned Performance Awards shall accrue and be paid only when and to the extent that the underlying shares of Stock are earned or paid.  
ARTICLE X  OTHER
STOCK-BASED AWARDS  10.1 Authority to Grant Other Stock-Based Awards. Subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan,
the Committee, at any time, and from time to time, may grant other types of equity-based or equity-related Awards not otherwise described by the terms and provisions of the Plan (including the grant or offer for sale of unrestricted shares of Stock)
under the Plan to eligible persons in such number and upon such terms as the Committee shall determine. Such Awards may involve the transfer of actual shares of Stock to Holders, or payment in cash or otherwise of amounts based on the value of

respect to Other Stock-Based Awards shall be affected by the Holders Termination of Employment or severance of affiliation relationship with the Company. Such provisions shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Committee and need not
be uniform among all Other Stock-Based Awards issued pursuant to the Plan.   10.5 Time of Payment of Other Stock-Based
Award. A Holders payment under an Other Stock-Based Award shall be made at such time as is specified in the applicable Award Agreement. If a payment under the Award Agreement is subject to Section 409A, the Award Agreement shall

Risk of Forfeiture or (b) at a time that is Permissible under Section 409A.   ARTICLE XI

Section 409A.   11.5 Termination of Employment or Affiliation. The Committee shall determine the extent to which
a Holders rights with respect to Cash-Based Awards shall be affected by the Holders Termination of Employment or severance of affiliation relationship with the Company. Such provisions shall be determined in the sole discretion of the
Committee and need not be uniform among all Cash-Based Awards issued pursuant to the Plan.

administration of the Plan; and (f) make all other determinations and take all other actions deemed necessary, appropriate or advisable for the proper administration of the Plan. 
The Committee may correct any defect or supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or in any Award to a Holder in the
manner and to the extent the Committee deems necessary or desirable to further the Plans objectives. Further, the Committee shall make all other determinations that may be necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan. As permitted
by law and the terms and provisions of the Plan, the Committee may delegate its authority as identified in this Section 13.2. The Committee may employ attorneys, consultants, accountants, agents, and other persons, any of whom may be an
Employee, and the Committee, the Company, and its officers and Board shall be entitled to rely upon the advice, opinions, or valuations of any such persons. 
13.3 Decisions Binding. All determinations and decisions made by the Committee or the Board, as the case may be, pursuant to the
provisions of the Plan and all related orders and resolutions of the Committee or the Board, as the case may be, shall be final, conclusive and binding on all persons, including the Company, its stockholders, Holders and the estates and
beneficiaries of Holders.   13.4 No Liability. Under no circumstances shall the Company, the Board or the Committee
incur liability for any indirect, incidental, consequential or special damages (including lost profits) of any form incurred by any person, whether or not foreseeable and regardless of the form of the act in which such a claim may be brought, with
respect to the Plan or the Companys, the Committees or the Boards roles in connection with the Plan.   ARTICLE
XIV  AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION OF PLAN 
14.1 Amendment, Modification, Suspension, and Termination. Subject to Section 14.2, the Board may, at any time and from
time to time, alter, amend, modify, suspend, or terminate the Plan and the Committee may, at any time and from time to time, alter, amend, modify, suspend, or terminate any Award Agreement in whole or in part; provided, however, that, without the
prior approval of the Companys stockholders and except as provided in Section 4.7, the Committee shall not directly or indirectly lower the Option Price of a previously granted Option or the grant price of a previously granted SAR, cancel
a previously granted Option or previously granted SAR for a payment of cash or other property if the aggregate fair market value of such Award is less than the aggregate Option Price of such Award in the case of an Option or the aggregate grant
price of such Award in the case of a SAR, and no amendment of the Plan shall be made without stockholder approval if stockholder approval is required by applicable law or stock exchange rules.

 14.2 Awards Previously Granted. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to
the contrary, no termination, amendment, suspension, or modification of the Plan or an Award Agreement shall adversely affect in any material way any Award previously granted under the Plan, without the written consent of the Holder holding such
Award.   ARTICLE XV 
MISCELLANEOUS 
15.1 Unfunded Plan/No Establishment of a Trust Fund. Holders shall have no right, title, or interest whatsoever in or to any
investments that the Company or any of its Affiliates may make to aid in meeting obligations under the Plan. Nothing contained in the Plan, and no action taken pursuant to its provisions, shall create or be construed to create a trust of any kind,
or a fiduciary relationship between the Company and any Holder, beneficiary, legal representative, or any other person. To the extent that any person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company under the Plan, such right shall be no
greater than the right of an unsecured general creditor of the Company. All payments to be made hereunder shall be paid from the general funds of the Company and no special or separate fund shall be established and no segregation of assets shall be
made to assure payment of such amounts, except as expressly set forth in the Plan. No property shall be set aside nor shall a trust fund of any kind be established to secure the rights of any Holder under the Plan. The Plan is not intended to be
subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.   15.2 No Employment Obligation. No grant
or Award to an Employee or Consultant under the Plan or any provisions thereof shall constitute any agreement for or guarantee of continued employment by the Company and no grant or Award to a Director shall constitute any agreement for or guarantee
of continuing as a Director.   15.3 Tax Withholding. The Company or any Affiliate shall have the right to deduct from
other compensation payable to each Holder any sums required by foreign, federal, state or local tax law to be withheld with respect to the vesting or exercise of an Award or lapse of restrictions on an Award. In the alternative, the Company may
require the Holder (or other person validly exercising the Award) to pay such sums for taxes directly to the Company or any Affiliate in cash or by check within one day after the date of vesting, exercise or lapse of restrictions. In the discretion
of the Committee, and with the consent of the Holder, the Company may reduce the number of shares of Stock issued to the Holder upon such Holders exercise of an Option to satisfy the tax withholding obligations of the Company or an Affiliate;
provided that the Fair Market Value of the shares of Stock held back shall not exceed the Companys or the Affiliates Minimum Statutory Tax Withholding Obligation. The Committee may, in its discretion, permit a Holder to satisfy any
Minimum Statutory Tax Withholding Obligation arising upon the vesting of an Award by delivering to the Holder a reduced number of shares of Stock in the manner specified herein. If permitted by the Committee and acceptable to the Holder, at the time
of vesting of shares under the Award, the Company shall (a) calculate the amount of the Companys or an Affiliates Minimum Statutory Tax Withholding Obligation on the assumption that all such 

   - 24 - 





 
shares of Stock vested under the Award are made available for delivery, (b) reduce the number of such shares of Stock made available for delivery so that the Fair Market Value of the shares
of Stock withheld on the vesting date approximates the Companys or an Affiliates Minimum Statutory Tax Withholding Obligation and (c) in lieu of the withheld shares of Stock, remit cash to the United States Treasury and/or other
applicable governmental authorities, on behalf of the Holder, in the amount of the Minimum Statutory Tax Withholding Obligation. The Company shall withhold only whole shares of Stock to satisfy its Minimum Statutory Tax Withholding Obligation. Where
the Fair Market Value of the withheld shares of Stock does not equal the amount of the Minimum Statutory Tax Withholding Obligation, the Company shall withhold shares of Stock with a Fair Market Value slightly less than the amount of the Minimum
Statutory Tax Withholding Obligation and the Holder must satisfy the remaining minimum withholding obligation in some other manner permitted under this Section 15.3. The withheld shares of Stock not made available for delivery by the Company
shall be retained as treasury shares or will be cancelled and the Holders right, title and interest in such shares of Stock shall terminate. The Company shall have no obligation upon vesting or exercise of any Award or lapse of restrictions on
an Award until the Company or an Affiliate has received payment sufficient to cover the Minimum Statutory Tax Withholding Obligation with respect to that vesting, exercise or lapse of restrictions. Neither the Company nor any Affiliate shall be
obligated to advise a Holder of the existence of the tax or the amount which it will be required to withhold.  15.4
Indemnification of the Committee. The Company shall indemnify each past, present and future member of the Committee against, and each member of the Committee shall be entitled without further action on his or her part to indemnity from the
Company for, all expenses (including attorneys fees, the amount of judgements and the amount of approved settlements made with a view to the curtailment of costs of litigation, other than amounts paid to the Company itself) reasonably incurred
by such member in connection with or arising out of any action, suit or proceeding in which such member may be involved by reason of such member being or having been a member of the Committee, whether or not he or she continues to be a member of the
Committee at the time of incurring the expenses, including, without limitation, matters as to which such member shall be finally adjudged in any action, suit or proceeding to have been negligent in the performance of such members duty as a
member of the Committee. However, this indemnity shall not include any expenses incurred by any member of the Committee in respect of matters as to which such member shall be finally adjudged in any action, suit or proceeding to have been guilty of
gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of his duty as a member of the Committee. In addition, no right of indemnification under the Plan shall be available to or enforceable by any member of the Committee unless, within 60 days
after institution of any action, suit or proceeding, such member shall have offered the Company, in writing, the opportunity to handle and defend same at its own expense. This right of indemnification shall inure to the benefit of the heirs,
executors or administrators of each member of the Committee and shall be in addition to all other rights to which a member of the Committee may be entitled as a matter of law, contract or otherwise.  
15.5 Gender and Number. If the context requires, words of one gender when used in the Plan shall include the other and words
used in the singular or plural shall include the other.

 15.6 Severability. In the event any provision of the Plan shall be held illegal or
invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of the Plan, and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included.  
15.7 Headings. Headings of Articles and Sections are included for convenience of reference only and do not constitute part of
the Plan and shall not be used in construing the terms and provisions of the Plan.   15.8 Other Compensation Plans.
The adoption of the Plan shall not affect any other option, incentive or other compensation or benefit plans in effect for the Company or any Affiliate, nor shall the Plan preclude the Company from establishing any other forms of incentive
compensation arrangements for Employees, Directors or Consultants.   15.9 Retirement and Welfare Plans. Neither
Awards made under the Plan nor shares of Stock or cash paid pursuant to such Awards, may be included as compensation for purposes of computing the benefits payable to any person under the Companys or any Affiliates retirement
plans or welfare plans unless such other plan expressly provides that such compensation shall be taken into account in computing participants benefit.  
15.10 Other Awards. The grant of an Award shall not confer upon the Holder the right to receive any future or other Awards under
the Plan, whether or not Awards may be granted to similarly situated Holders, or the right to receive future Awards upon the same terms or conditions as previously granted.  
15.11 Successors. All obligations of the Company under the Plan with respect to Awards granted hereunder shall be binding on any
successor to the Company, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, of all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company.  
15.12 Law Limitations/Governmental Approvals. The granting of Awards and the issuance of shares of Stock under the Plan shall be
subject to all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and to such approvals by any governmental agencies or national securities exchanges as may be required.  
15.13 Delivery of Title. The Company shall have no obligation to issue or deliver evidence of title for shares of Stock issued
under the Plan prior to (a) obtaining any approvals from governmental agencies that the Company determines are necessary or advisable; and (b) completion of any registration or other qualification of the Stock under any applicable national
or foreign law or ruling of any governmental body that the Company determines to be necessary or advisable.   15.14
Inability to Obtain Authority. The inability of the Company to obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Companys counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any
shares of Stock hereunder, shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such shares of Stock as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained.

 15.15 Investment Representations. The Committee may require any person receiving
Stock pursuant to an Award under the Plan to represent and warrant in writing that the person is acquiring the shares of Stock for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such Stock.  
15.16 Persons Residing Outside of the United States. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, in order to
comply with the laws in other countries in which the Company or any of its Affiliates operates or has Employees, the Committee, in its sole discretion, shall have the power and authority to (a) determine which Affiliates shall be covered by the
Plan; (b) determine which persons employed outside the United States are eligible to participate in the Plan; (c) amend or vary the terms and provisions of the Plan and the terms and conditions of any Award granted to persons who reside
outside the United States; (d) establish sub plans and modify exercise procedures and other terms and procedures to the extent such actions may be necessary or advisable  any sub plans and modifications to Plan terms and procedures
established under this Section 15.16 by the Committee shall be attached to the Plan document as Appendices; and (e) take any action, before or after an Award is made, that it deems advisable to obtain or comply with any necessary local
government regulatory exemptions or approvals. Notwithstanding the above, the Committee may not take any actions hereunder, and no Awards shall be granted, that would violate the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Code, any securities
law or governing statute or any other applicable law.   15.17 Arbitration of Disputes. Any controversy arising out of
or relating to the Plan or an Award Agreement shall be resolved by arbitration conducted pursuant to the arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration shall be final and binding on the parties.  
15.18 No Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Stock shall be issued or delivered pursuant to the Plan or any Award. The
Committee shall determine whether cash, additional Awards, or other property shall be issued or paid in lieu of fractional shares of Stock or whether such fractional shares or any rights thereto shall be forfeited or otherwise eliminated. 
 15.19 Governing Law. The provisions of the Plan and the rights of all persons claiming thereunder shall be construed,
administered and governed under the laws of the State of Delaware, excluding any conflicts or choice of law rule or principle that might otherwise refer construction or interpretation of the Plan to the substantive law of another jurisdiction.
Unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, recipients of an Award under the Plan are deemed to submit to the sole and exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the federal or state courts of Texas, to resolve any and all issues that may arise out
of or relate to the Plan or any related Award Agreement.
