THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the respective covenants and agreements of the parties herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows: 
1. Employment and Term.  (a) The Company hereby agrees that Rex Operating shall employ the Executive, and the Executive hereby accepts such employment, on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth. The parties agree that the
Executives employment may in the future be transferred to Rex Energy, so that the Executive may be employed by either Company under this Agreement. The period of employment of the Executive under this Agreement (the Employment

Term, after taking into account all of the extensions thereof, the Executive shall be an at-will employee of the Company.  (b) The term of this Agreement (the Term) shall begin on the Effective Date and shall end on April 25, 2012; provided, that, on April 25, 2012, and each anniversary of
April 25 thereafter, the Term shall be extended for one (1) additional year unless either party shall have given the other party at least ninety (90) days prior written notice not to extend the Term or the Executive shall have
incurred a termination of employment with the Company as described herein.  (c) Failure of the Company to renew
the Agreement at the end of the Term shall not by itself be considered a termination of employment by the Company or a Good Reason (as defined in Section 6(d) below) event, except as specifically provided herein. 




 Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Company fails to renew the Agreement at the end of the
Term and the Company terminates the Executives employment without Cause (as defined in Section 6(c) below) within ninety (90) days following the end of the Term, the Executive shall be entitled to the benefits in Section 8(e),
subject to the terms of Section 8(e) and compliance with the covenants in Section 9.  2. Position and Duties.
 (a) As of the Effective Date, the Executive shall serve as Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate

best of her ability to further the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. Subject to Section 9 herein, the Executive may only serve as a director of other companies if such service is approved in advance by the Board of Directors
of Rex Energy (the Board), so long as such service is not detrimental to the Company, does not interfere with the Executives service to the Company and does not present the Executive with a conflict of interest. The
Executive may invest her own assets in such form or manner as will not require her services in the daily operations of the affairs of the companies in which such investments are made, provided that no such investment violates the Executives
obligations under Section 2(d) or 9 herein.  (c) In keeping with the Executives fiduciary duties to
the Company, the Executive agrees that she shall not, directly or indirectly, become involved in any conflict of interest, or upon discovery thereof, allow such a conflict to continue. Moreover, the Executive agrees that she shall promptly disclose
to the Board any facts which might involve any reasonable possibility of a conflict of interest, or be perceived as such.  (d) Circumstances in which a conflict of interest on the part of the Executive would or might arise, and which should be reported immediately by the Executive to the Board, include the following:
 (i) ownership of a material interest in, acting in any capacity for, or accepting directly or indirectly any
payments, services or loans from a supplier, contractor, subcontractor, customer or other entity with which the Company does business;  (ii) misuse of information or facilities to which the Executive has access in a manner which will be detrimental to the Companys interest; 
   2

the Executive or the diversion to others, directly or indirectly, of any opportunity in which it is known or could reasonably be anticipated that the Company would be interested; and 
(vi) the ownership, directly or indirectly, of a material interest in an enterprise in competition with the Company or its
dealers and distributors or acting as a director, officer, partner, consultant, employee or agent of any enterprise which is in competition with the Company or its dealers or distributors. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2, it shall not be a violation of this Agreement for the Executive to become
the registered or beneficial owner of up to five percent (5%) of any class of the capital stock of a corporation registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), provided that the
Executive does not actively participate in the business of such corporation.  (e) Further, the Executive
covenants, warrants and represents that she shall:  (i) devote her full and best efforts to the fulfillment of
her employment obligations;  (ii) exercise the highest degree of fiduciary loyalty and care and the highest
standards and conduct in the performance of her duties;  (iii) abide by any compensation clawback, recoupment
or anti-hedging policy applicable to executives of the Company or its affiliates, in effect from time to time, as approved by the Board or a duly authorized committee thereof; and

Companys obligations to provide indemnity pursuant to Section 10 hereof.

Accrued Obligation Defined. For purposes of this Agreement, payment of the Accrued Obligation shall mean payment by the Company to the Executive (or her designated beneficiary or legal representative, as applicable),
when due, of all vested benefits to which the Executive is entitled under the terms of the employee benefit plans in which the Executive is a participant as of the Date of Termination and a lump sum amount in cash equal to the sum of (i) the
Executives Base Salary through the Date of Termination, and (ii) in accordance with the Companys paid time off policy, any accrued paid time off, to the extent not theretofore paid, which shall be paid within thirty (30) days
after the Date of Termination.  (b) Disability; Death. Following the termination of the Executives
employment pursuant to Sections 6(a) or (b) hereof, the Company shall pay to the Executive (or her designated beneficiary or legal representative, if applicable): 
(i) the Accrued Obligation, 
   9 





 (ii) in the event of the Executives termination of employment by
reason of death, a lump sum payment in cash equal to ninety (90) days of the Executives Base Salary as in effect on the Date of Termination, which shall be paid within thirty (30) days following the Date of Termination, and
 (iii) in the event of the Executives termination of employment by reason of death or
Disability, a lump sum separation payment in cash equal to the Executives annual cash bonus at the target achievement level for the fiscal year of the Company in which the Date of Termination occurs, prorated based on service for the year of
termination. The pro rated bonus shall be determined by multiplying the target bonus by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the fiscal year before the Date of Termination and the denominator is the number of days in the
fiscal year. If the Executives employment terminates by reason of death, the separation payment shall be paid on the sixtieth (60th) day following the Date of Termination, subject to compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the Code). If the Executives employment terminates by reason of Disability, the separation payment shall be paid on the sixtieth (60th) day following the Date of Termination (the Commencement Date), subject to compliance
with Section 409A of the Code. The Executive shall not be entitled to any other payments under the annual cash bonus plan with respect to the fiscal year in which the Date of Termination for death or Disability occurs. 
(c) By the Company for Cause. If during the Term the Executives employment is terminated by the Company for
Cause pursuant to Section 6(c) hereof, the Company shall pay to the Executive the Accrued Obligation. Following such payment, the Company shall have no further obligations to the Executive other than as may be required by law or the terms of an
employee benefit plan of the Company.  (d) By the Executive without Good Reason. If during the Term the
Executive terminates her employment for any reason other than Good Reason, the Company shall pay to the Executive the Accrued Obligation. Following such payment, the Company shall have no further obligations to the Executive other than as may be
required by law or the terms of an employee benefit plan of the Company. The Executive shall not have breached this Agreement merely because she terminates her employment for any reason other than Good Reason. 
(e) By the Company without Cause or by the Executive for Good Reason. Provided that the Executive is not eligible
for benefits under the Rex Energy Corporation Executive Change of Control Policy effective February 10, 2011, or a successor policy thereto (the Change of Control Policy) with respect to the termination of employment,
if, (x) during the Term, the Executives employment is terminated by the Company other than for Cause, death or Disability or the Executive terminates employment for Good Reason, or (y) the Company fails to renew the Agreement at the
end of the Term and the Company terminates the Executives employment without Cause within ninety (90) days following the end of the Term as set forth in Section 1, then the Company shall pay to the Executive the Accrued Obligation
and, subject to the Executive executing and not revoking a Release as described in Section 8(e)(iii) and provided that the Executive complies with the covenants set forth in Section 9: 
   10 






 (i) The Company shall pay or provide the following: 
(1) The Company shall pay the Executive severance pay equal to the Executives monthly Base Salary (at the rate in
effect as of the Date of Termination) for the six (6) month period following the Date of Termination (the Severance Period). The severance payments will begin on the Commencement Date, and the first payment will
include the first sixty (60) days of monthly installments. The severance payments will continue in installments in accordance with the Companys regular payroll practices for the remainder of the six (6) month period following the
Date of Termination, subject to compliance with Section 409A.  (2) The Company shall pay the Executive a
lump sum cash payment equal to the Executives annual cash bonus for the fiscal year of the Company in which the Date of Termination occurs, prorated based on service for the year of termination. For this purpose, the annual bonus shall be
calculated as the annual cash bonus that the Executive would have received had the Executive remained employed through the end of such year, based on the Companys achievement of the applicable performance goals, and multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of days in the fiscal year before the Date of Termination and the denominator is the number of days in the fiscal year. The bonus payment shall be paid when bonuses are paid to other executives participating in
the Annual Incentive Plan.  (3) For the Severance Period, the Company shall arrange to
provide the Executive and her dependents medical, dental, health, hospital insurance benefits substantially similar to those provided to the Executive and her dependents immediately prior to the Date of Termination, as such benefit plans may be
modified by the Company from time to time for similarly situated active employees (at no greater cost to the Executive than such cost to the Executive in effect immediately prior to the Date of Termination, or, if greater, the cost to similarly
situated active employees of the Company under the applicable group health plans of the Company), provided that the Executive timely elects coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended
(COBRA) and pays the COBRA premiums for the full cost of the continued coverage. The Executive shall be responsible for paying the full COBRA cost of such coverage, and the Company shall reimburse the Executive monthly for
the amount equal to the Executives monthly COBRA cost, less the employee portion of the premium that the Executive would have paid had the Executive continued employment with the Company; provided that reimbursement of the COBRA cost shall be
discontinued prior to the end of the Severance Period if the Executive elects to discontinue COBRA coverage, if the Executive fails to pay the applicable COBRA costs or in accordance with Section 8(e)(ii) below. The COBRA reimbursement payments
shall be paid monthly on the first payroll date of each calendar month, beginning on Commencement Date, subject to compliance with Section 409A of the Code. The first payment (on the sixtieth (60th) day) will include the first two (2) months of COBRA
reimbursements. The 
   11 






 
Executive understands and agrees that for purposes of determining the remaining period of the Executives COBRA continuation coverage after the end of the Severance Period, the
Executives qualifying event shall be deemed to have occurred on the Date of Termination. 
(4) On the Commencement Date, the Company shall pay the Executive a lump sum amount equivalent to the product of the
monthly basic life insurance premium applicable to the Executives basic life insurance coverage immediately prior to the Date of Termination times the number of months in the Severance Period, subject to compliance with Section 409A of
the Code. The Executive may, at her option, convert her basic life insurance coverage to an individual policy after the Date of Termination by completing the forms required by the Company for this purpose. 
(ii) Subject to the Executives group health plan coverage continuation rights under COBRA, the benefits described in
Section 8(e)(i)(3) shall be reduced to the extent benefits of the same type are received by or made available to the Executive during such period, and reimbursements under Section 8(e)(i)(3) shall cease if the Executive becomes eligible to
receive benefits of the same type as described in Section 8(e)(i)(3). The Executive shall have the obligation to notify the Company that she is entitled to or receiving such benefits. The Company agrees that, if the Executives employment
with the Company terminates for any reason during the Term, the Executive is not required to seek other employment or to attempt in any way to reduce any amounts payable to the Executive by the Company pursuant to this Section 8. Further,
except with respect to the benefits provided pursuant to Section 8(e)(i)(3) above, the amount of any payment or benefit provided for in this Agreement shall not be reduced by any compensation earned by the Executive as the result of employment
by another employer, by retirement benefits, or by offset against any amount claimed to be owed by the Executive to the Company.  (iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, all payments to the Executive under this Section 8 (other than Accrued Obligations) are contingent upon the Executives execution and non-revocation of a
release with terms substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto (the Release) within sixty (60) days following the Executives Date of Termination. In consideration of the benefits and compensation which
may be awarded to the Executive pursuant to Section 8 of this Agreement, the Executive hereby agrees to execute and be bound by the Release, as a condition precedent to receiving such benefits and compensation. No severance payments will be
paid to the Executive if the Executive does not execute, or if the Executive revokes, the Release. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in order to comply with Section 409A of the Code, in no event shall the timing
of the Executives execution of the Release, directly or indirectly, result in the Executive designating the calendar year of payment, and if a payment that is subject to execution of the Release could be made in more than one taxable year,
payment shall be made in the later taxable year. 
   12 






 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if the Executive is
entitled to receive severance payments or benefits under the Rex Energy Corporation Executive Change of Control Policy upon the Executives termination of employment, the Executive will not be eligible to receive any severance payments or
benefits under this Agreement with respect to such termination of employment.  9. Confidential Information;
Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation; Non-Disparagement.  (a) Confidential Information. 
(i) The Executive shall hold in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the Company all trade secrets, confidential
information, and knowledge or data relating to the Company or its subsidiaries and their businesses, which shall have been obtained by the Executive during the Executives employment by the Company and which shall not have been or hereafter
become public knowledge (other than by acts by the Executive or representatives of the Executive, in each case, in violation of this Agreement) (hereinafter being collectively referred to as Confidential Information). For
the avoidance of doubt, Confidential Information shall not include information that becomes available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by the Executive or that becomes available to the Executive from a source other than the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents or advisors, provided, that such source is not known by the Executive to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with or other obligation of secrecy
to the Company or any of its subsidiaries.  (ii) The Executive shall not, without the prior written consent of
the Company or as may otherwise be required by law or legal process, communicate or divulge any such trade secrets, information, knowledge or data to anyone other than the Company and those designated by the Company. Any termination of the
Executives employment or of this Agreement shall have no effect on the continuing operation of this Section 9(a). The Executive agrees to return all Confidential Information, including all photocopies, extracts and summaries thereof, and
any such information stored electronically on tapes, computer disks or in any other manner to the Company at any time upon request by the Company and upon the termination of her employment hereunder for any reason. 
(b) Non-Competition.  (i) During the Employment Period and the Restricted Period, as defined below, the Executive shall not, within the Restricted Territory, as defined below, engage in Competition, as defined below, with
respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries; provided, that it shall not be a violation of this Section 9(b) for the Executive to become the registered or beneficial owner of up to five percent (5%) of any class of the capital stock
of a corporation registered under the Exchange Act as long as the Executive does not actively participate in the business of such corporation until such time as this covenant expires. 
(ii) For purposes of this Agreement, the Restricted Period means the applicable period in clause
(1) if the Date of Termination occurs during the Term of the Agreement, or the applicable period in clause (2), (3) or (4) if the Date of Termination occurs after the end of the Term: 
   13 






 (1) The Restricted Period is the six (6) month period following the
Executives Date of Termination during the Term for any reason.  (2) In the event the Company elects not
to renew the Agreement at the end of the Term and the Executive receives severance pay as a result of a termination without Cause under Section 1(c) or a termination for Good Reason under Section 6(d), the Restricted Period is the
applicable period described in clause (1) above.  (3) If clause (2) does not apply, in the event the
Company or the Executive elects not to renew the Agreement at the end of the Term, and during the six (6) month period following the end of the Term the Executives employment terminates for any reason other than Cause, the Company will
either:  (A) within thirty (30) days after the Date of Termination, offer in writing to provide the
Executive with severance pay equal to the Executives Base Salary for all or part of the remainder of the six (6) month period following the end of the Term, subject to the Executive executing and not revoking a Release, in which case the
Restricted Period shall be the remainder of the six (6) month period following the end of the Term (or, if the Company only offers to provide severance pay for a portion of the remainder of the six (6) month period following the end of the
Term, the Restricted Period shall be such portion of the period for which the Company offers severance pay), or 
(B) advise the Executive in writing that the Restricted Period shall not apply after the Date of Termination. 
The severance pay will be paid at the same time and in the same form as would have applied if the severance pay had been paid under
Section 8(e)(i)(A). If the Company offers to provide such severance pay but the Executive does not execute the Release, or revokes the Release, the Restricted Period will nevertheless run for the remainder of the six (6) month period after
the end of the Term, but no severance payments will be paid to the Executive.  (4) In the event the Company or
the Executive elects not to renew the Agreement at the end of the Term, and during the six (6) month period following the end of the Term the Executives employment terminates for Cause, the Restricted Period shall be the applicable period
described in clause (1) above, and no severance pay shall be provided.  (iii) For purposes of this
Agreement, Restricted Territory means anywhere within a ten (10) mile radius of any area of mutual interest, evidenced by a written contractual obligation, of the Company or its subsidiaries or any oil or gas property
in which the Company or any of its subsidiaries has an interest, or is actually pursuing or contemplating (as described below) an interest, as of the Date of 
   14 






 
Termination. The Company or a subsidiary will be considered to be contemplating an interest in property for purposes of this subsection (iii) if the Executive knows that the Company or a
subsidiary is actively contemplating an interest in the property within the 90-day period preceding the Date of Termination, as evidenced by written or electronic correspondence or records. 
(iv) For purposes of this Agreement, Competition by the Executive means the Executives
engaging in, or otherwise directly or indirectly being employed by or acting as a consultant or lender to, or being a director, officer, employee, principal, agent, stockholder, member, owner or partner of, or permitting her name to be used in
connection with the activities of any other business or organization which competes, directly or indirectly, with the business of the Company or its subsidiaries as the same shall be constituted at any time during the Term. 
(v) The Executive may request that the Board waive the restrictions under this Section 9(b) with respect to the
Executives prospective employment with an entity engaged in Competition if the Executives work will clearly not relate in any way to the Restricted Territory. The Board shall have sole discretion to determine whether such a waiver will
be allowed and the terms and conditions of any such waiver.  (c) Non-Solicitation. During the six
(6) month period following the Date of Termination for any reason, if the Date of Termination occurs during the Term or within six (6) months after any non-renewal of the Term, the Executive agrees that the Executive will not, directly or
indirectly, for her benefit or for the benefit of any other person, firm or entity, do any of the following: 
(i) solicit, from any customer that is doing business with the Company or any of its subsidiaries as of the Date of
Termination and is known to Executive, any business of the same or of a similar nature to the business of the Company or its subsidiaries with such customer;  (ii) solicit, from any potential customer of the Company or its subsidiaries that is known to the Executive, any business of the same or of a similar nature to that which has been the subject of a known
written or oral bid, offer or proposal by the Company or its subsidiaries, or of substantial preparation with a view to making such a bid, proposal or offer, within six (6) months prior to the Date of Termination; 
(iii) excluding advertisements in mainstream media, solicit the employment or services of any person who was known to be
employed by or was a known consultant to the Company or its subsidiaries upon the Date of Termination, or within six (6) months prior thereto, provided that it shall not be a breach of this Section 9(c)(iii) to solicit or engage a
consultant if the consultants services do not interfere with the consultants services to the Company or cause the consultant to engage in Competition in the Restricted Territory; or 
(iv) otherwise knowingly interfere with the business or accounts of the Company or its subsidiaries. 
   15 






 (d) Non-Disparagement. The Executive agrees, and the Company agrees
to instruct its officers and directors, not to make any derogatory, disparaging or false statements intended to harm the business or personal reputation of the other party to this Agreement and, in the case of the Company, of any related companies
or their officers and employees.  (e) Agreements with respect to Covenants. The Executive and the
Company agree and acknowledge that the Company is providing the employment, compensation and benefits under this Agreement in consideration for the Executives covenants under this Section 9. The Executive and the Company agree and
acknowledge that the Company has a substantial and legitimate interest in protecting the Companys and its subsidiaries Confidential Information and goodwill. The Executive and the Company further agree and acknowledge that the provisions
of this Section 9 are reasonably necessary to protect the Companys and its subsidiaries legitimate business interests and are designed to protect the Companys and its subsidiaries Confidential Information and goodwill.
The Executive agrees that the scope of the restrictions as to time, geographic area, and scope of activity in this Section 9 are reasonably necessary for the protection of the Companys and its subsidiaries legitimate business
interests and are not oppressive or injurious to the public interest. The Executive and the Company agree that in the event of a breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions of this Section 9, the Company or the Executive, as
applicable, shall be entitled to injunctive relief against the Executives or the Companys activities, as applicable, to the extent allowed by law, and the Executive and the Company waive any requirement for the posting of any bond by the
Company or the Executive, as applicable, in connection with such action. The Executive further agrees that any breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions of Section 9(a) would cause injury to the Company for which monetary damages
alone would not be a sufficient remedy.  (f) Permitted Disclosure. Nothing in this Agreement shall
prohibit or restrict the Executive or the Company from (i) making any disclosure of relevant and necessary information or documents in any action, investigation or proceeding, as required by law or legal process; or (ii) participating,
cooperating, or testifying in any action, investigation, or proceeding with, or providing information to, any governmental agency or legislative body, any self-regulatory organization, or the Companys Legal Department, provided that, to the
extent permitted by law, upon the Executives receipt of any subpoena, court order or other legal process compelling the disclosure of any such information, documents, or testimony, the Executive shall give prompt prior written notice to the
Company, and the Executive will make no disclosure until the Company has had a reasonable opportunity to contest the right of the requesting person or entity to such disclosure. 
10. Indemnification; Insurance. The Company shall indemnify the Executive to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the
Companys state of incorporation in effect at the time and the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Company. The Executive will be entitled to any insurance policies the Company may elect to maintain generally for the benefit of
officers and directors of the Company and its subsidiaries against all costs, charges and expenses incurred in connection with any action, suit or proceeding to which the Executive may be made a party by reason of being a director or officer of the
Company or its subsidiaries. 
   16 






 11. Successors Binding Agreement. 
(a) Companys Successors. The Company may require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase,
merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to
perform it if no such succession had taken place. As used in this Agreement, Company shall mean the Company as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its business and/or assets as aforesaid which executes and delivers
the agreement provided for in this Section 11 or which otherwise becomes bound by all the terms and provisions of this Agreement by operation of law.  (b) Executives Successors. This Agreement and all rights of the Executive hereunder shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executives personal or legal representatives,
executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees. If the Executive should die while any amounts would still be payable to him hereunder if she had continued to live, all such amounts unless otherwise provided herein
shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to the Executives devisee, legatee or other designee or, if there is no such designee, to the Executives estate. 
12. Notice. For the purposes of this Agreement, notices, demands and all other communications provided for in this Agreement shall
be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered or (unless otherwise specified) mailed by United States certified or registered mail or nationally recognized overnight courier (such as Federal Express, Express Mail or UPS),

such other address as either party may have furnished to the other in writing in accordance herewith, except that notices of change of address shall be effective only upon receipt. 
   17 






 13. Amendment or Modification; Waiver. No provisions of this Agreement may be
modified, waived or discharged unless such waiver, modification or discharge is agreed to in writing signed by the Executive and such officer or director of the Company as may be specifically designated by the Board or the Compensation Committee. No
waiver by either party hereto at any time of any breach by the other party hereto of, or compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by such other party shall be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions
or conditions at the same or at any prior or subsequent time. No agreements or representations, oral or otherwise, express or implied, with respect to the subject matter hereof have been made by either party which are not set forth expressly in
Agreement.  14. Governing Law. The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be
governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania without regard to its conflicts of law principles.  15.
Miscellaneous. All references to sections of any statute shall be deemed also to refer to any successor provisions to such sections. The respective rights and obligations of the parties hereunder shall survive the termination of the Term to
the extent necessary to preserve such rights and obligations, including, without limitation, Sections 8, 9, 10 and 11. The Executive shall not be a participant in and shall not be entitled to receive benefits pursuant to any other severance plan,
program, policy or arrangement of the Company.  16. Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision
or provisions of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect throughout the Term. Should any one or more of the provisions of this Agreement be
held to be excessive or unreasonable as to duration, geographical scope or activity, then that provision shall be construed by limiting and reducing it so as to be reasonable and enforceable to the extent compatible with the applicable law.
 17. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an
original but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.  18. Withholding. All payments under
this Agreement shall be made subject to applicable tax withholding, and the Company may withhold from any amounts payable to the Executive relating to the Executives employment with the Company such federal, state, local and foreign taxes as
shall be required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation. The Executive shall bear all expense of, and be solely responsible for, all federal, state, local and foreign taxes due with respect to any payment received under this
Agreement.  19. Deferred Compensation. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement
is intended to meet the requirements of Section 409A of the Code to the extent applicable, the parties intend to administer this Agreement in a manner that is consistent with those requirements or an exception thereto, and this Agreement shall
be construed and interpreted in accordance with such intent. If and to the extent applicable, severance benefits shall be paid first under the short-term deferral exception and then under the separation pay exception of
Section 409A, and any payments that are considered deferred compensation under 
   18 






 
Section 409A and that are paid to a specified employee (as defined in Section 409A of the Code) upon separation from service shall be subject to a six (6) month delay,
if required by Section 409A. If required by Section 409A, any amounts otherwise payable during the six (6) month period that commences on and follows the Executives Date of Termination shall be paid in one lump sum amount on the
first business day following the six (6) month period following the Executives Date of Termination (or within thirty (30) days of the Executives death, if earlier). For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, all payments to
be made upon a termination of employment under this Agreement may only be made upon a separation from service (within the meaning of such term under Section 409A of the Code). Each payment made under this Agreement shall be treated
as a separate payment and the right to a series of installment payments shall be treated as the right to a series of separate payments. In no event shall the Executive, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of a payment. All
reimbursements under this Agreement shall be provided in a manner that complies with Section 409A of the Code, if applicable. If required by regulations or other guidance issued under Section 409A of the Code or a court of competent
jurisdiction, the provisions regarding payments hereunder shall be amended to provide for such payments to be made at the time allowed under such regulations, guidance or authority that most closely achieves the intent of this Agreement. 
20. Entire Agreement. This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement of the parties hereto in respect of the subject matter
contained herein and, as of the Effective Date, supersedes all prior agreements, promises, covenants, arrangements, communications, representations or warranties, whether oral or written, by any officer, employee or representative of any party
hereto, including the Offer Letter, except as certain provisions of the Offer Letter are incorporated herein.  21.
Effectiveness; Survival. This Agreement shall become effective upon approval of the Board. The Company shall provide a certified copy of the resolution evidencing such approval. The provisions of this Agreement that, by their terms, continue
in effect after the end of the Term of this Agreement shall continue in effect as necessary to carry out their purposes. 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement on the date first above written.

Agreement is binding on the representatives, heirs, successors and assigns of Employee and the Company.
