identical), including the time or times when a person shall be permitted to receive payment pursuant to an Award; and the number of shares of Common Stock covered by such Award.
 
(ii)                                  To construe and interpret the Plan, Awards granted under it, Award Agreements, and to establish, amend and revoke rules and regulations for their administration. The Board, in the exercise of this power, may correct any defect, omission or inconsistency in the Plan or in any Award Agreement, in a manner and to the extent it shall deem necessary or expedient to make the Plan fully effective.
 
(iii)                               To amend the Plan, an Award, or an Award Agreement as provided in Section 11.

Companys Certificate of Incorporation, as the same may be amended from time to time, or as otherwise provided in any agreement between any such member and the Company.
 
(e)                                  Conformance to Section 409A of the Code. If, at any time, tax advisors to the Company determine that the terms of any outstanding Award result in additional tax or interest to the holder under Section 409A of the Code, the Board or the Committee shall have the authority to enter into an amendment of such Award, consistent with this Plan, that is designed to avoid such additional tax or interest. If any Award constitutes deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, any acceleration of the payment of such Award upon a Change of Control as provided under this Plan shall occur only if the Change of Control constitutes, in the good-faith determination of the Board or the Committee, a change in control event as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5). If any other payment under this Plan constitutes deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and if any provisions of the Award Agreement fails to satisfy the requirements of Section 409A(2), (3) or (4) of the Code with respect to such payment, such provision shall be operated in a manner that, in the good-faith determination of the Board or the Committee, seeks to bring the provision into compliance with those requirements while preserving as closely as possible the original intent of the provision.
 
(f)                                   No Guaranty of Favorable Tax Treatment. Although the Company intends to administer the Plan so that Awards will be exempt from, or will comply with, the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, the Company does not warrant that any Award under the Plan will qualify for favorable tax treatment under Section 409A of the Code or any other provision of federal, state, local or foreign law. The Company shall not be liable to any Participant for any tax, interest or penalties the Participant might owe as a result of the grant, holding, vesting, exercise or payment of any Award under the Plan.

shall be in such form and shall contain such terms and conditions as the Board or the Committee shall deem appropriate. The provisions of separate Stock Appreciation Rights need not be identical.
 
(c)                                  Provisions Applicable to All Stock Appreciation Rights.
 
(i)                                     Base Price. The base price of each Stock Appreciation Right shall be not less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date the Stock Appreciation Right is granted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Stock Appreciation Right may be granted with an exercise price lower than that set forth in the preceding sentence if such Stock Appreciation Right is granted pursuant to an assumption or substitution for another stock appreciation right in a manner satisfying the provisions of Section 409A of the Code.
 
(ii)                                  Term. No Stock Appreciation Right shall be exercisable after the expiration of the Exercise Period next following ten (10) years from the date it was granted.
 
(iii)                               Vesting Generally. A Stock Appreciation Right may (A) vest, and therefore become exercisable, in periodic installments that may, but need not, be equal, (B) have its vesting accelerated as set forth in an Award Agreement, or (C) be fully vested at the time of grant. The Stock Appreciation Right may be subject to such other terms and conditions on the time or times when it may be exercised (which may be based on performance or other criteria) as the Board or the Committee may deem appropriate. The vesting provisions, if any, of individual Stock Appreciation Rights (or portions thereof) may vary. The provisions of this subsection 6(c)(iii) are subject to any Plan or Award Agreement provisions governing when a Stock Appreciation Right may be exercised once vested and any minimum number of shares as to which a Stock Appreciation Right may be exercised.

(v)                                 Exercise Period. Vested Stock Appreciation Rights may be exercised, if at all, only during an open Exercise Period.  An Exercise Period will be the period designated by the Board or the Committee and will generally be a 30 day period following the review and release of the annual Common Stock valuation.  The Board or the Committee may also establish an Exercise Period that coincides with vesting of specific Stock Appreciation Rights grants.  A designated Exercise Period will occur at least once per calendar year and must occur, as necessary, to provide a reasonable exercise period in conjunction with a Change in Control, unless vested Awards are otherwise settled in conjunction there with.  The Board or the Committee will establish additional administrative rules governing the establishment of the Exercise Period for Stock Appreciation Rights as it deems necessary.
 
(vi)                              Termination of Continuous Service. Unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, in the event a Participants Continuous Service terminates for any reason, all Stock Appreciation Rights held by the Participant shall immediately terminate; provided, however, if a Participants Continuous Service is terminated by the Company for reasons other than for Cause, all vested Stock Appreciation Rights held by such person shall continue to be exercisable until the earlier of the expiration date of such Stock Appreciation Right or the expiration of the Exercise Period next following the date of such termination. All such vested Stock Appreciation Rights not exercised within the period described in the preceding sentence shall terminate.
 
(vii)                           Limits on Exercise and Transfer. Unless otherwise expressly provided in (or pursuant to) this subsection 6(c)(vii), applicable law or the Award Agreement, as the same may be amended from time to time: (x) all Stock Appreciation Rights are non-transferable and will not be subject in any manner to sale, transfer, alienation, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or charge; (y) Stock Appreciation Rights will be exercised only by the Participant; and (z) amounts payable pursuant to a Stock Appreciation Rights will be delivered only to (or for the account of) the Participant.  The exercise and transfer restrictions in this subsection 6(c)(vii) will not apply to (A) transfers to the Company or, with the express written approval of the Board or the Committee, transfers by gift to immediate family, as that term is defined in SEC Rule 16a-1(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act, (B) the designation of a beneficiary to receive benefits if the Participant dies or, if the Participant has died, transfers to or exercises by the Participants beneficiary, or, in the absence of a validly designated beneficiary, transfers by will or the laws of descent and distribution, or (C) if the Participant has suffered a Disability, permitted transfers or exercises on behalf of the Participant by the Participants duly authorized legal representative.

(c)                                  Board Discretion. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein, in the event of, or in anticipation of, a termination of employment or service with the Company for any reason, other than a discharge for Cause, the Board or the Committee may accelerate the vesting and exercisability of all or a portion of an Award and/or extend the exercisability period of a Participants Stock Appreciation Right upon such terms as the Board or the Committee determines as expressly set forth in or by amendment to the Award Agreement evidencing such Stock Appreciation Right or other Award; provided that, in the good faith determination of the Board or the Committee, such acceleration or extension will not likely result in the imposition of additional tax or interest under Section 409A of the Code for the holder of the affected Award.

(j)                                    Legal Compliance.  This Plan and all Awards shall be subject to applicable United States federal and state laws, rules and regulations and to such approvals by any government or regulatory agency as may be required.  The Company, in its discretion, may delay the issuance of any Award or the payment of any amounts thereunder until compliance with such laws, rules and regulations has been secured (although the Company is under no obligation or legal liability to secure such compliance), and may require any individual to whom an Award is granted, and such individuals beneficiary or legal representative, as applicable, to make such representations and furnish such information as the Board or the Committee may consider necessary, desirable or advisable in connection with the issuance or exercise of Awards under the Plan in order to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations.

and provided further that, in the good faith determination of the Board or the Committee, the terms of such adjustment are not likely to result in the imposition of additional tax or interest under Section 409A of the Code for the holder of an affected Award. The Board or the Committee shall make such adjustments, and its determination shall be final, binding and conclusive.
 
(b)                                 Change of Control. Except as otherwise set forth in an Award Agreement, unless prior to a Change of Control the Board or the Committee determines that, upon its occurrence, benefits under any or all Awards will not accelerate or determines that only certain or limited benefits under any or all Awards will be accelerated and the extent to which they will be accelerated, and/or establishes a different time in respect of such event for such acceleration, then upon (or, as may be necessary to effectuate the purposes of this acceleration, immediately prior to) the occurrence of a Change of Control each Award will become immediately vested and exercisable. Any acceleration of an Award will comply with applicable legal requirements and, if necessary to accomplish the purposes of the acceleration or if the circumstances otherwise require, may be deemed by the Board or the Committee to occur not more than thirty (30) days before or only upon the consummation of the Change of Control.
 
(c)                                  Termination of Awards. Without any limitation on the Boards or the Committees authority pursuant to the foregoing, if the vesting of any Award has been fully accelerated as required or permitted pursuant to the foregoing but is not exercised prior to (x) a dissolution of the Company, (y) an event described in subsection 10(a) that the Company does not survive or (z) the consummation of a Change of Control approved by the Board or the Committee, the Award shall terminate, subject to any provision that has been expressly made by the Board or the Committee for the survival, substitution, assumption, exchange or other settlement of the Award.
 
(d)                                 Possible Rescission of Acceleration. If the vesting of any Award has been accelerated in anticipation of an event or upon stockholder approval of an event and the Board or the Committee later determines that the event will not occur, the Board or the Committee may rescind the effect of the acceleration as to any then outstanding and unexercised or otherwise unvested Award.
 
(e)                                  Alternative Settlement. In the event of any transaction subject to subsection 10(a) or (b), the Board or the Committee may make provision for a settlement or for the substitution of any or all outstanding Awards for cash, securities or other property (or for other awards) based on the distribution or consideration payable to holders of the Common Stock upon or in respect of such event; provided that, in the good faith determination of the Board or the Committee, the terms of such settlement or substitution are not likely to result in the imposition of additional tax or interest under Section 409A of the Code to the holder of an affected Award.
