capitalized terms used in this Amendment and not otherwise defined are used as defined in the Original Agreement, except that the term the Agreement shall mean the Original Agreement as amended by this Amendment). 
WITNESSETH: 
WHEREAS, pursuant to that certain Purchase, Sale and Assumption Agreement dated May 23, 2012, by and among Kimmeridge,
AllianceBernstein, AllianceBernstein Corporation of Delaware, a Delaware corporation, and Alliance Capital Management, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, Kimmeridge has acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Participant
and acquired all of the rights and interests, and assumed all of the liabilities and obligations, of AllianceBernstein arising out of the Original Agreement; and  WHEREAS, effective August 9, 2011, Matador Resources Company changed its name to MRC Energy Company; and  WHEREAS, the Parties desire to equalize their ownership interests and investments in the Leases and the development thereof;  WHEREAS, the Parties desire to amend the Original Agreement and the Operating Agreement in the manner set forth below;  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, the mutual covenants and benefits herein provided and for other valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the
Parties agree as follows:   


1.
Assignment of Additional Working Interests.  (a) For the Purchase Price (as defined below), the Owners hereby agree to assign to the Participant a 50% working interest in each Lease (as such defined term is amended in this Amendment) now held by an
Owner and located within the AMI, as defined in the Original Agreement, as well as a 50% working interest in any Lease acquired or renewed with the $3 million of the Purchase Price for leasing, Lease renewal or extension costs and other associated
costs specified in Section 1(b)(iii) below, SAVE and EXCEPT any working interest in any Lease which has already been assigned to Participant in whole or 
   1 





 
in part. It is the intent of Participant and Owner that Owner shall record certain assignments of working interests that will result in Participant and Owner each owning a proportionate 50%
working interest in each of the oil and gas Leases currently held by Owner and/or Participant in the AMI. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) all assignments of interest to Participant effected pursuant to this Amendment will be
substantially in the form of the Assignment attached to the Agreement, (ii) each Lease will be subject to the Operating Agreement, as amended by this Amendment, (iii) each Lease will be subject to the prior assignment to Roxanna of a
proportionately reduced 2.5% of 8/8ths overriding royalty interest in the assigned Leases, and (iv) the Owners, on the one hand, and Participant, on the other, shall each have the right to acquire a proportionately reduced 50% aggregate working
interest in each Lease hereafter acquired by any Party in the AMI, at a cost equal to 50% of the lease bonus cost and any other sunk costs incurred by such Party in acquiring such Lease. For avoidance of doubt, (X) leases subject to
(iv) above include without limitation any lease previously held by a Party in the AMI that has now expired and may be reacquired by a Party, and (Y) the cost to Participant to acquire a Working Interest shall not include 50% of any lease
bonus or other sunk cost paid to acquire the applicable Lease funded out of the $9 million to be paid by Participant pursuant to Section 1(b) below. In the event of a forced pooling of any Lease or a forced assumption of a working interest,
each party shall bear its proportionate share of any costs associated with such pooled or assumed interest.  (b) Purchase
Price. In payment for the working interests assigned to Participant pursuant to Section 1(a) above, Participant hereby agrees to make the following payments totaling $9 million: (i) Participant agrees to pay $5 million to drill and
test (complete) the Crawford Federal #1H Well, with any drilling costs in excess of $5 million to be borne by the Parties in proportion to their working interests in the applicable Lease (subject to any terms of the Operating Agreement that would,
under the circumstances, allocate a cost other than in proportion to working interests) (ii) Participant shall, immediately upon signing this Amendment, pay $1.0 million by wire transfer to MRC Energy Company as a prospect fee; and
(iii) Participant shall pay $3.0 million to MRC Energy Company towards leasing and Lease renewal or extension costs and other associated costs within the AMI, provided that all Leases within the AMI that may be renewed are renewed out of such
$3.0 million and that after such $3.0 million have been fully exhausted, all subsequent costs shall be borne by the Parties on a 50%/50% heads-up basis (subject to any terms of the Operating Agreement that would, under the circumstances, allocate a
cost other than in proportion to working interests). Matador, subject to the terms of the Operating Agreement, may invoice Participant for the foregoing costs committed by it to be paid solely by Participant other than the $1 million payment under
(ii) above and $2.3 million of the $3 million payment under (iii) above, which will be paid immediately upon signing of this Amendment by Participant to MRC Energy Company. Subject to prior receipt by Participant of reasonable support
demonstrating the expenditure of the $2.3 million transferred to MRC Energy Company pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence on lease and Lease renewal or extension costs or other associated costs within the AMI, the remaining $700,000 of the
$3 million payment under (iii) above shall be paid by Participant to MRC Energy Company within thirty (30) days of receipt of an invoice or invoices for further lease renewal or extension costs and other associated costs

   2 





 
within the AMI that have been incurred or are intended to be incurred within sixty (60) days thereafter. Attached to this Amendment as Exhibit A-1 is a schedule of the Leases in
effect on the date of this Amendment, which schedule lists the dates and amounts of renewal payments required for each such Lease.   


2.
Initial Test Well. The Parties agree and acknowledge that the Initial Test Well has been drilled, that the obligations of the Parties in respect of the Initial
Commitment Amount have been fully performed and that there are no remaining obligations of any Party arising under Article I of the Agreement, save for those arising under or in respect of the working interests held by the Parties in and to the
Lease associated with the Initial Test Well.   


3.

Agreement. Operator, Matador, Roxanna and Participant agree to amend Exhibit A to the Operating Agreement by inserting an addendum to reflect the working interest of the Parties with respect to the Leases reflecting the working interests
owned in such Leases by the Participant after giving effect to the Amendment.  (b) The Parties hereby effect the
following three amendments to the Operating Agreement:  (i) All references in the Operating Agreement to, and terms in such
