The Allocated Value of each Asset as set forth on Exhibit B-1 is attributed thereto for the sole purpose of calculating Title Defects, Environmental Defects, Interest Additions and adjustments to the Purchase Price on account of Excluded or Retained Assets. In no event shall the Allocated Value be used or deemed controlling for any other purpose, including tax purposes, or be otherwise deemed by Buyer, Seller or any third party to be a representation or warranty of any kind by either Party as to the productive capacity, quantity of reserves or actual value, market or otherwise, of any Asset.

ARTICLE 4


 

TITLE MATTERS


 





4.1.


Definitions.




 





  


A.


Defensible Title. The term "Defensible Title" means, as of the Effective Date and the Closing Date, such title to each Asset, that, subject to and except for Permitted Encumbrances: (i) entitles Seller to receive and retain, without suspension, reduction or termination, not less than an 80.0% net revenue interest (“NRI") in each of the Leases and in Seller’s interest in the each of the Wells, said NRI to be proportionately reduced to reflect the mineral rights covered by each Lease, the Seller’s undivided interest in the Lease, and the tract participation of the Lease in any applicable drilling or spacing unit (hereinafter referred to as an “80.0% NRI”); (ii) obligates Seller to bear costs and expenses relating to the maintenance, development, operation and the production of Hydrocarbons in an amount not greater than the working interest ("WI") set forth in Exhibit A or B, without a corresponding increase in the NRI; and (iii) is free and clear of encumbrances, liens and defects.

1.


lessors' royalties, overriding royalties, net profits interests, production payments, reversionary interests and similar burdens (payable or in suspense) if the net cumulative effect of such burdens does not operate to reduce the NRI of Seller in the affected Asset to less than an 80.0% NRI;











  


2.


liens for Taxes or assessments not yet due and not delinquent;











  


3.


all rights to consent by, required notices to, filings with, or other actions by federal, state or local governmental bodies, in connection with the conveyance of the applicable Asset if the same are customarily obtained after such conveyance and have been obtained in connection with all prior transfers and conveyances;











  


4.


rights of reassignment upon the surrender or expiration of any Lease, and well-takeover provisions;











  


5.


the terms and conditions of the Material Agreements to the extent such do not decrease the NRI for the affected Asset to less than an 80.0% NRI or increase the WI for such Asset set forth on Exhibit A or B without a corresponding proportionate increase in the NRI for such Asset, or materially interfere with operation of the affected Asset;











  


6.


easements, rights-of-way, servitudes, permits, surface leases and other rights with respect to surface operations, on, over or in respect of any of the Assets or any restriction on access thereto that do not materially interfere with the operation of the affected Asset as has been conducted in the past or materially affect the value thereof;











  


7.


materialmen's, mechanics', operators' or other similar liens arising in the ordinary course of business incidental to operation of the Assets (i) if such liens and charges have not been filed pursuant to law and the time for filing such liens and charges has expired, or (ii) if filed, such liens and charges have not yet become due and payable;

Page 21 of 61







  







  


C.


Title Defect. The term "Title Defect" means any lien, encumbrance, claim, defect in or objection to real property title, excluding Permitted Encumbrances, that alone or in combination with other defects renders Seller's title to the Asset (i) less than Defensible Title, and (ii) reduces the Allocated Value of the affected Asset. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following shall not be considered Title Defects:











  


1.


defects in the early chain of title, consisting of the failure to recite marital status in a document or omissions of heirship or estate proceedings, unless Buyer provides reasonable written evidence that such failure or omission has resulted in another party claiming title to the relevant Asset;











  


2.


defects in acknowledgements;











  


3.


defects arising out of lack of survey unless required by applicable law or contract;











  


4.


defects based on failure to record Leases issued by the Bureau of Land Management or any state, or any assignments of record title or operating rights in such Leases, in the real property or other county records of the county in which such Asset is located; provided that such Leases or assignments are properly filed with the applicable federal or state office;











  


5.

D.


Title Defect Value. "Title Defect Value" means the amount by which the Allocated Value of an Asset has been reduced by a Title Defect. In determining the Title Defect Value, the Parties intend to include only that portion of the Asset affected by the Title Defect. The Title Defect Value may not exceed the Allocated Value of the Asset and shall be determined as follows:











  


1.


Lien or Encumbrance Created by Seller.  If the Title Defect is a lien or encumbrance on the Asset created by Seller, Seller shall have the lien or encumbrance unconditionally released at or prior to Closing, and, if so released, there shall be no Title Defect Value associated with such lien or encumbrance.




 


 



  



Page 22 of 61







  







  


2.


Defect Reducing NRI.  If the Title Defect results in a reduction in the NRI of Seller in any Lease or in any Well below 80.0%, proportionately reduced, then Buyer and Seller agree to a downward adjustment equal to the amount determined by multiplying the Allocated Value for the affected portion of the Asset by a fraction, the numerator of which is the difference between 80.0% NRI and the actual NRI, and the denominator of which is 80.0%.











  


3.


Lien Created by Third Party.  If the Title Defect results from the existence of a lien created by someone other than Seller (or if Seller fails to have a lien created by it unconditionally released at or prior to Closing), the Title Defect Value shall be an amount sufficient to discharge such lien, but in no event greater than the Allocated Value of the affected Asset.











  


4.


Liquidated Obligation or Burden.  If the Title Defect is based on an obligation or burden that is liquidated, the Title Defect Value will be the sum necessary to remove the obligation or burden from the affected Asset; provided, however, that the Title Defect Value shall never exceed the Allocated Value of the affected Asset.











  


5.


Non-liquidated Obligation or Burden.  If the Title Defect is based on an obligation or burden that is not liquidated, but can be estimated with reasonable certainty, the Title Defect Value will be the sum necessary to compensate Buyer on the Closing Date for the adverse economic effect on the affected Asset; provided, however, that the Title Defect Value shall never exceed the Allocated Value of the affected Asset.











  


6.


Defect Reducing Net Acres of Undeveloped Leasehold. If the Title Defect results in a reduction of the number of net leasehold acres that Seller claims to own, as shown in Exhibit A, in any portion of a Lease that is not located within a drillsite spacing unit for a producing Well,  the Purchase Price to be paid to the Seller shall be reduced by an amount equal to the number of net leasehold acres in the Lease as specified in Exhibit A less the number of net leasehold acres that the Seller actually owns in the Lease, multiplied by the applicable net acre value for the affected Lease and Lands as shown on Exhibit B-1.











  


7.


All other Defects.  If the Title Defect results from any matter not described above (or if the Title Defect results from the existence of an encumbrance created by Seller that Seller fails to have unconditionally released at or prior to Closing), the Title Defect Value shall be an amount equal to the difference between the value of the portion of the Assets with such Title Defect and the value of such Assets without such Title Defect (taking into account the Allocated Value of such Assets), but in no event greater than the Allocated Value of such Asset.







 



  



Page 23 of 61







  



 





4.2. 


Purchase Price Adjustments for Title Defects.











  


A.


Notices of Title Defects. Buyer shall deliver to Seller, no later than 60 days after the date of execution of this Agreement (the "Title Defect Date"), a "Title Defect Notice". Each Title Defect Notice must be in writing and must satisfy the following conditions precedent: (i) name each affected Asset; (ii) describe each Title Defect in reasonable detail; (iii) describe the basis for each Title Defect; (iv) attach Supporting Documentation, if any; (v) state the Allocated Value of the affected Asset; and (vi) state Buyer's good faith estimate of the Title Defect Value which shall not exceed the Allocated Value. For the purposes of this Article, "Supporting Documentation" for a particular Title Defect means if the basis is derived from any document, a copy of such document (or pertinent part thereof) or if the basis is derived from any gap in Seller's chain of title, the documents preceding and following the gap shall be attached, or in any case, any other reasonable written documentation that may exist.




 






4.3. 


Title Defect Adjustments.  Upon receipt of the Title Defect Notice:





 





  


A.


Seller’s Response to Defect Notice. Seller shall deliver written counter notice to Buyer within three (3) business days of receipt of the Title Defect Notice which states (i) whether it agrees or disagrees that an asserted Title Defect exists; (ii) whether it agrees or disagrees with the Title Defect Value attributed to each Title Defect; and (iii) whether it will either (a) attempt to correct the asserted Title Defect, or (b) not attempt to correct the Title Defect.











  


B.


If Seller Disagrees with Title Defect Notice. If Seller gives counter notice that it disagrees that an asserted Title Defect exists, or that it disagrees with the Title Defect Value attributed to a Title Defect, the existence of the Title Defect and the corresponding Title Defect Value will be determined in accordance with Article 4.4.











  


C.


Effect of Seller’s Failure to Deliver Response to Defect Notice. The failure of Seller to deliver written counter notice to Buyer within three (3) days of receipt of the Title Defects Notice shall be deemed notice that the Seller (i) agrees with all of the Title Defects asserted by the Seller; (ii) agrees with the Title Defect Value attributed to each of the Title Defects; and (i) will not attempt to correct any of the Title Defects.











  


D.


Seller’s Agreement with Defect Notice and Seller’s Election Not to Cure. If Seller gives counter notice that it agrees with the Title Defect and Title Defect Value asserted in the Title Defect Notice but that it will not attempt to correct the affected Title Defect, the affected Asset shall be included in the Closing and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Title Defect Value (the "Title Defect Adjustment"). However, if the Title Defect Value exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the Allocated Value of the affected Asset, Seller shall have the option to exclude such affected Asset from the Transaction (which Asset shall thereupon be deemed a Retained Asset of the Seller) in which case the Purchase Price will be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of the Retained Asset, and Buyer shall be deemed to have released and waived any claim to the Retained Asset.




 


 



  



Page 24 of 61







  







  


E.


Seller’s Agreement with Defect Notice and Seller’s Election to Cure.  If Seller gives counter notice that it agrees with the Title Defect and the Title Defect Value but elects to correct the Title Defect, then fails to cure the Title Defect to Buyer's reasonable satisfaction before Closing, Buyer shall have the election to either include the affected Asset at Closing and reduce the Purchase Price by an amount equal to the Title Defect Value ; or (ii) allow Seller to attempt to cure such Title Defect after Closing, in which case Article 4.3.F will apply.











  


F.


Cure of Title Defects by Seller After Closing. If Buyer elects to allow Seller to cure any Title Defect after Closing, the affected Asset will be deemed to be an Excluded Asset, and will be excluded from the Closing. The Purchase Price payable at Closing shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of the Excluded Asset. However,  Seller shall then have fifty (50) days after Closing to attempt to cure the Title Defect (the "Cure Period"). If Seller cures the Title Defect to Buyer's reasonable satisfaction within the Cure Period, then Buyer will be obligated to tender to Seller the Allocated Value of the affected Asset (subject to appropriate adjustments to the Allocated Value to reflect: (i) any revenues and expenses attributable to the Asset which is the subject to the Title Defect between the Effective Date and the date the subject Asset is assigned to Buyer; and (ii) the Party which received or paid said revenues and/or expenses) in exchange for the simultaneous delivery of an assignment of the Asset from Seller to Buyer using an assignment form similar to that attached as Exhibit E.











4.4.


Title Defect Disputes. If the Seller is of the opinion that a Title Defect identified in the Title Defect Notice does not exist, or that the Title Defect exists, but the Title Defect Value attributed to the Title Defect is incorrect, the Parties shall immediately enter into good-faith negotiations, in person, at a location mutually agreed to by the parties, in an attempt to reach an agreement as to (a) the existence and scope of a Title Defect, and (b) the Title Defect Value of the Title Defect.  If the Parties are able to reach an agreement with regard to (a) and (b) on or before the Closing Date, the affected Asset will be assigned to Buyer subject to a reduction in the Purchase Price in the amount of the agreed Title Defect Value.  If the Parties are unable to reach an agreement as to (a) or (b) as of the Closing Date, the affected Asset will be excluded from the Transaction and the Purchase Price at Closing will be reduced by the Allocated Value of the affected Asset.  However, the Parties will have the continuing obligation and duty, for a period of fifty (50) days following the Closing Date to negotiate, in good faith, to reach an agreement as to (a) and (b) above.

The term "Interest Addition" shall mean, with respect to an Asset, the ownership by Seller of a (i) greater NRI in such Asset than the NRI set forth for such Asset on Exhibit A or (ii) a lesser WI in such Asset than the WI set forth for such Asset on Exhibit A without a proportionate change in NRI. Buyer acknowledges and agrees to comply with the affirmative obligation set forth in the first sentence of this Article.

To Seller's Knowledge, all preferential purchase rights and consents to assign affecting the Assets, except governmental consents that are customarily obtained after Closing, are set forth on Exhibit D.  "Required Consents" include all consents and approvals except those which are customarily obtained post-Closing or those which would not invalidate the conveyance of the Asset. To the extent that there are preferential purchase rights or consents to assign affecting the Assets, the provisions of this Article shall apply. Seller shall use its reasonable efforts to assist Buyer in obtaining all consents to assign. If Buyer discovers a consent to assign or preferential right to purchase during the course of Buyer's due diligence activities, Buyer shall notify Seller immediately and Seller shall use its best efforts to obtain such consents or waivers and to give the notices required in connection with the preferential rights prior to Closing.

Consent Obtained as of Final Settlement Date.  If a Required Consent has been obtained as of the Final Settlement Date, Buyer shall pay Seller the Allocated Value of the affected Asset (subject to appropriate adjustments to the Allocated Value to reflect: (i) any revenues and expenses attributable to the Asset which is the subject of the Title Defect between the Effective Date and the date the subject Asset is assigned to Buyer; and (ii) the Party which received or paid said revenues and/or expenses) in exchange for the simultaneous assignment from Seller to Buyer of the affected Asset using an assignment form similar to that attached as Exhibit E.











D.  


Failure to Obtain Consent as of Final Settlement Date.  If Required Consent has not been obtained as of the Final Settlement Date, the affected Asset shall be retained by Seller and the Final Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of the affected Asset. However, in the event the required Consent is obtained after the Final Settlement Date but within 180 days of the Closing Date, Seller shall immediately give notice of the Consent to Buyer and Buyer shall have the option, to be exercised within five business days of receipt of Seller’s notice, to tender to Seller the Allocated Value of the Asset (subject to appropriate adjustments to the Allocated Value to reflect: (i) any revenues and expenses attributable to the Asset which is the subject of the Title Defect between the Effective Date and the date the subject Asset is assigned to Buyer; and (ii) the Party which received or paid said revenues and/or expenses) in exchange for the simultaneous assignment from Seller to Buyer of the affected Asset using an assignment form similar to that attached as Exhibit E to this Agreement.

1.  


If any preferential right to purchase is exercised and consummated prior to the Closing Date, that portion of the Assets affected by such preferential purchase right shall be excluded from the Transaction and the Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of  the affected Assets.









  



Page 27 of 61







  







2.  


If by Closing, the time frame for the exercise of such preferential purchase rights has not expired and Seller has not received notice of an intent not to exercise or a waiver of the preferential purchase right, that portion of the Assets affected by such preferential purchase right shall be included in the Assets and assigned to Buyer at Closing. If such preferential purchase right is eventually exercised, the provisions of Article 4.8.F.3 below shall apply.











3.  


If the affected Asset has been conveyed to Buyer at Closing, and a preferential purchase right affecting the Asset is consummated after Closing, Buyer agrees to convey such affected Asset to the party exercising such preferential purchase right on the same terms and conditions under which Seller conveyed such Assets to Buyer and retain all amounts paid by the party exercising such preferential right to purchase. In the event of such exercise, Buyer shall prepare, execute and deliver an assignment of such Asset to such exercising party, on the form attached as Exhibit E, and Seller agrees to hold harmless and indemnify Buyer from any and all liabilities and obligations associated with such assigned Asset.











4.9.


Exclusive Remedy. Except for the representations and warranties contained in Articles 6.12, 6.21 and 6.22 and the special warranty of title contained in the Assignment, the rights and remedies granted Buyer in Article 4 shall be the exclusive right and remedy of Buyer with respect to Title Matters affecting the Assets. Notwithstanding anything herein provided to the contrary, if a Title Defect under this Article 4 results from any matter which could also result in the breach of any representation or warranty of Seller in this Agreement (other than those contained in Articles 6.12, 6.22 and 6.22, then Buyer shall only be entitled to assert such matter before the Title Defect Date as a Title Defect to the extent permitted by this Article 4.

D.


Seller’s Agreement with Defect But Election Not to Cure.  If Seller gives notice that it agrees with an Environmental Defect asserted in the Environmental Defect Notice and the associated Environmental Defect Value, but that it will not attempt to remediate or correct the Environmental Defect, the affected Asset shall be assigned to Buyer at Closing and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Environmental Defect Value (the "Environmental Defect Adjustment") of the affected Asset. However, if the Environmental Defect Value exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the Allocated Value of the affected Asset, Seller shall have the option to exclude such affected Asset from the Transaction (which Asset shall thereupon be  a Retained Asset of Seller) or to assign the Asset to Buyer and reduce the Purchase Price by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of the affected Asset.  In the case of retention by Seller, Buyer shall be deemed to have released and waived any claim to the retained Asset.











  


E.


Seller’s Agreement with Defect and Election to Cure.  If Seller gives counter notice that it agrees with an Environmental Defect asserted in Environmental Defect Notice and the associated Environmental Defect Value, and elects to correct the asserted Environmental Defect, but fails to cure said Environmental Defect to Buyer's reasonable satisfaction before Closing, Buyer shall have the option to either (i) assign the affected Asset to Buyer at Closing and reduce the Purchase Price in an amount equal to the Environmental Defect Value of the Asset, or (ii) grant Seller an additional 50 days after Closing in which to cure the Environmental Defect, in which case Article 5.4.F will apply.

Seller’s Right to Cure After Closing.  If Buyer elects to allow Seller to cure any Environmental Defect after Closing, the affected Asset will be deemed to be an Excluded Asset, and will be excluded from the Closing. The Purchase Price payable at Closing shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of the Excluded Asset.  Seller shall then have fifty (50) days after Closing to attempt to cure the Environmental Defect (the "Cure Period"). If Seller cures the Environmental Defect to Buyer's reasonable satisfaction within the Cure Period, then Buyer shall tender to Seller the Allocated Value of the affected Asset (subject to appropriate adjustments to the Allocated Value to reflect: (i) any revenues and expenses attributable to the Asset which is the subject to the Title Defect between the Effective Date and the date the subject Asset is assigned to Buyer; and (ii) the Party which received or paid said revenues and/or expenses) in exchange for the simultaneous delivery of an assignment of the Asset from Seller to Buyer using an assignment form similar to that attached as Exhibit E.











5.5.


Dispute of Parties Regarding Environmental Defect. If the Seller is of the opinion that an Environmental Defect identified in the Environmental Defect Notice does not exist, or that the Environmental exists, but the Environmental Defect Value attributed to the Environmental Defect is incorrect, the Parties shall immediately enter into good-faith negotiations, in person, at a location mutually agreed to by the parties, in an attempt to reach an agreement as to (a) the existence of the Environmental Defect, and (b) the Environmental Defect Value of the Environmental Defect.  If the Parties are able to come to an agreement with regard to (a) and (b) on or before the Closing Date, the affected Asset will be assigned to Buyer at Closing subject to a reduction in the Purchase Price in the amount of the agreed Environmental Title Defect Value.  If the Parties are unable to reach an agreement as to (a) or (b) as of the Closing Date, the affected Asset will be excluded from the Closing and the Purchase Price payable at Closing will be reduced by the Allocated Value of the affected Asset. However, the Parties will have the continuing obligation and duty, for a period of fifty (50) days following the Closing Date to negotiate, in good faith, to reach an agreement as to (a) and (b) above. If an agreement is reached within the 50 days following the Closing, Buyer shall tender to Seller, in cash, an amount equal to the Allocated Value of the affected Asset (subject to appropriate adjustments to the Allocated Value to reflect: (i) any revenues and expenses attributable to the Asset which is the subject of the Title Defect between the Effective Date and the date the subject Asset is assigned to Buyer; and (ii) the Party which received or paid said revenues and/or expenses) less the Environmental Defect Value agreed to by the Parties, in exchange for the simultaneous delivery, from Seller to Buyer, of an assignment of the Asset using an assignment form similar to that attached as Exhibit E to this Agreement.  If no agreement is reached within the 50 days following the Closing, the Asset shall be retained by the Seller, and Buyer shall be deemed to have released and waived any claim to the Asset.

ARTICLE 9


 

TAX MATTERS








9.1.


Apportionment of Tax Liability. "Taxes" shall mean all ad valorem, property, production, excise, net proceeds, severance, and all other taxes and similar obligations assessed against the Assets or based upon or measured by the ownership of the Assets or the production of Hydrocarbons or the receipt of proceeds therefrom, other than income taxes. All Taxes based on production of hydrocarbons shall be deemed attributable to the period during which such production occurred, and not to the period during which such Taxes are assessed. All Taxes shall be prorated between Buyer and Seller as of the Effective Date for all taxable periods that include the Effective Date. The apportionment of Taxes between the Parties shall take place as an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Article 2.3 in the Preliminary Statement, using estimates of such Taxes if actual numbers are not available. Subject to the provisions of Article 14.3, Taxes are considered part of the Property Expenses.









  



Page 44 of 61







  







9.2


Calculation of Tax Liability. Consistent with Article 9.1, and based on the best current information available as of Closing, the proration of Taxes shall be made between the Parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Article 2.3 and thereafter pursuant to the provision of Article 14.3.











9.3.


Tax Reports and Returns. Buyer will file all ad valorem tax returns from 2013 revenues and production and Seller shall pay and file all ad valorem taxes and tax returns related to 2012 revenue and production. Seller shall promptly pay Buyer for any ad valorem taxes withheld from post-Effective Date revenue. The Party not filing the return agrees to provide the Party filing the return with appropriate information which is necessary to file any required tax reports and returns related to the Assets. Notwithstanding the above, the rights to any amounts withheld from previous production proceeds for the purpose of paying then unpaid ad valorem taxes for 2012 production assessed in 2013 (due in 2014) or for 2013 production assessed in 2014 (due in 2015) will be assigned by Seller to Buyer at Closing. If any purchaser of production has not withheld any amounts from 2012 production proceeds for the purpose of paying ad valorem taxes assessed for 2013 (due in 2014), or for 2013 production assessed in 2014 (due in 2015) then (i) the actual amount necessary to pay the then unpaid ad valorem taxes assessed on 2012 production (due 2014) and (ii) the estimated amount that should have been withheld from 2013 production based upon pre-Effective Date production (at the rate indicated by Weld County) will be determined, and such amounts will be credited to Buyer at Closing. The assignment of, and credit for, these amounts shall serve as a final settlement for ad valorem taxes.











9.4.


Sales Taxes. Buyer and Seller will each be responsible for the share of any sales and use taxes, conveyance, transfer and recording fees and real estate transfer stamps or taxes that may be imposed on any transfer of the Assets pursuant to this Agreement that they are legally obligated to pay.











9.5


Overpayments of Seller’s Weld County, Colorado Ad Valorem Property Taxes.  According to Seller’s best information and belief, Weld County, Colorado ad valorem property tax returns filed by Seller in 2009, 2010 and 2011 were based on Weld County’s inventory of Seller’s property which overstated the amount and value of Seller’s taxable property, resulting in Seller’s overpayment of Weld County ad valorem taxes. Seller is in the process of amending and refiling the subject returns, and expects that it will ultimately receive a refund of its overpayment from Weld County, although the amount and timing of the refund is yet to be determined. Buyer and Seller hereby warrant and represent that to the extent either Party receives a refund from Weld County of ad valorem taxes paid by Seller in 2009, 2010 and 2011, the Party shall be obligated to ensure that any refund is distributed, in the proper proportions, to the parties who made or were charged for the overpayments.

POST-CLOSING OBLIGATIONS








13.1. 


Seller’s Right to Convert Stock Component of Purchase Price to Cash Payment. Upon Closing, Buyer shall immediately commence the listing application process with the NYSE:MKT, and otherwise use its best efforts, in order to obtain approval from the NYSE:MKT to list, with the NYSE:MKT, the shares of common stock of Synergy Resources Corporation that comprise the Stock Component of the Purchase Price, which is a precondition to the Buyer’s issuance of the Stock Component of the Purchase Price to Seller or its designated assignee. Although it usually takes no more than twenty (20) days from Closing for Buyer to obtain the necessary approvals from the NYSE:MKT and issue a certificate for the shares, Seller acknowledges that factors outside of the control of Buyer may delay the process beyond 20 days, and hereby agrees that it will extend the aforementioned 20 day period for a reasonable period of time, but only if the delay cannot be attributed to inaction or negligence on the part of the Buyer. If Buyer fails to deliver to Seller the Stock Component within 20 days of Closing, or any reasonable extension thereof, Seller shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to elect to receive, in lieu of the Stock Component, a cash payment in the amount of $4,375,000.00, to be delivered to Seller or its assignee by wire transfer in immediately available funds.




 





13.2.


Post-Closing Adjustments.




 



  



Page 51 of 61







  







A.  


Settlement Statement. As soon as practicable after the Closing, but in no event later than 60 days after Closing, Buyer, with assistance from Seller’s staff, will prepare and deliver to Seller, in accordance with customary industry accounting practices, the Final Settlement Statement setting forth each adjustment or payment to the Purchase Price that was not finally determined as of the Closing and showing the calculation of such adjustment and the resulting final purchase price (the "Final Purchase Price"). As soon as practicable after receipt of the Final Settlement Statement, but in no event later than on or before 10 days after receipt of Buyer’s  proposed Final Settlement Statement, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a written report containing any changes that Seller proposes to make to the Final Settlement Statement. Seller’s failure to deliver to Buyer a written report detailing proposed changes to the Final Settlement Statement within the aforementioned 10 days shall be deemed an acceptance by Seller of the Final Settlement Statement as submitted by Buyer. The Parties shall agree with respect to the changes proposed by Seller, if any, no later than 10 days after receipt by Buyer of Seller’s written report detailing its proposed changes to the proposed Final Settlement Statement. The date upon which such agreement is reached or upon which the Final Purchase Price is established shall be herein called the "Final Settlement Date." If the Final Purchase Price is more than the Closing Amount, Buyer shall pay Seller the amount of such difference. If the Final Purchase Price is less than the Closing Amount, Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount of such difference. Any payment by Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds within 5 days of the Final Settlement Date. Any adjustments requiring additional payment by either Buyer or Seller shall also be made in the same manner.




 






B.  


Dispute Resolution. If the Parties are unable to resolve a dispute as to the Final Purchase Price within  10 days after receipt by Seller of Buyer's written report detailing its proposed changes to the proposed Final Settlement Statement, the Parties shall submit the dispute to binding arbitration to be conducted pursuant to Article 14.6.

Page 53 of 61







  







B.  


Buyer's Indemnification of Seller. Buyer assumes all risk, liability, obligation and Losses in connection with, and shall defend, indemnify, and save and hold harmless Seller and its affiliates and their respective members, officers, directors, employees and agents, from and against any and all Losses and causes of action, liabilities and expenses relating to, or arising out of or connected, directly or indirectly, with the Assumed Liabilities.  Furthermore, in the event Buyer, pursuant to Article 5 of this Agreement, received a reduction in the Purchase Price as a result of an Environmental Defect in any Asset (the ‘Defective Asset”), and the Seller is subsequently held liable for any liability or damages arising from, or any cost of remediation related to, the Defective Asset, Buyer shall indemnify and hold Seller harmless for the aforementioned liability, damage or cost incurred by Seller, but only to the extent of the amount of the reduction in the Purchase Price that Buyer received from Seller as a result of the Defective Asset.












C.  


Release. Buyer shall be deemed to have released Seller at the Closing from any Losses for which Buyer has agreed to indemnify Seller hereunder, and Seller shall be deemed to have released Buyer at the Closing from any Losses for which Seller has agreed to indemnify Buyer hereunder.




 






14.5. 


Procedure. The indemnifications contained in Article 14.4 shall be implemented as follows:




 






A.   


Claim Notice. The Party seeking indemnification under the terms of this Agreement ("Indemnified Party") shall submit a written notice (a "Claim Notice") to the other Party ("Indemnifying Party") which shall list the amount claimed by an Indemnified Party, the basis for such claim, with supporting documentation, and list each separate item of Loss for which payment is so claimed. The amount claimed shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party to the extent required herein within 30 days after receipt of the Claim Notice, or after the amount of such payment has been finally established, whichever last occurs.





 






B.   


Information. If the Indemnified Party receives notice of a claim or legal action that may result in a Loss for which indemnification may be sought under this Agreement (a "Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall give written notice of such Claim to the Indemnifying Party as soon as is practicable. If the Indemnifying Party or its counsel so requests, the Indemnified Party shall furnish the Indemnifying Party with copies of all pleadings and other information with respect to such Claim. Unless a Claim involves material equitable or other non-monetary relief or involves or is brought by a Governmental Entity, at the election of the Indemnifying Party made within 60 days after receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party shall permit the Indemnifying Party to assume control of a Claim (to the extent only that such Claim, legal action or other matter relates to a Loss for which the Indemnifying Party is liable), including the determination of all appropriate actions, the negotiation of settlements on behalf of the Indemnified Party, and the conduct of litigation through attorneys of the Indemnifying Party's choice; provided, however, that any settlement of the claim by the Indemnifying Party may only be monetary in nature and shall not result in any liability or cost to the Indemnified Party without its prior written consent. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume control, (i) any expense incurred by the Indemnified Party thereafter for investigation or defense of the matter shall be borne by the Indemnified Party, and (ii) the Indemnified Party shall give all reasonable information and assistance, other than pecuniary, that the Indemnifying Party shall deem necessary to the proper defense of such Claim. In the absence of such an election, the Indemnified Party will use its commercially reasonable efforts to defend, at the Indemnifying Party's expense, any claim, legal action or other matter to which such other Party's indemnification under this Article 14 applies until the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense. If the Indemnifying Party fails to assume such defense within the time period provided above, the Indemnified Party may settle the Claim, in its reasonable discretion at the Indemnifying Party's expense. If such a Claim requires immediate action, both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party will cooperate in good faith to take appropriate action so as not to jeopardize defense of such Claim or either Party's position with respect to such Claim.

The arbitration shall be before a single arbitrator chosen by the mutual agreement of the Parties, or if no such agreement can be reached within 10 days, a three-person panel of neutral arbitrators, consisting of one person picked by each side, and the two arbitrators so selected picking the third (with the panel so picked or the single arbitrator referred to as the "Arbitrator"). The Arbitrator shall conduct a hearing no later than 60 days after submission of the matter to arbitration, and the Arbitrator shall render a written decision within 30 days of the hearing. At the hearing, the Parties shall present such evidence and witnesses as they may choose, with or without counsel. Adherence to formal rules of evidence shall not be required, but the Arbitrator shall consider any evidence and testimony that they determine to be relevant, in accordance with procedures that they determine to be appropriate. Any award entered in the arbitration shall be made by a written opinion stating the reasons and basis for the award made and any payment due pursuant to the arbitration shall be made within 15 days of the decision by the Arbitrator. The final decision shall be binding on the Parties, final and non-appealable, and may be filed in a court of competent jurisdiction and may be enforced by any Party as a final judgment of such court. Each Party shall bear its own costs and expenses of the arbitration, provided, however, that the costs of employing the Arbitrator shall be borne 50% by Seller and 50% by Buyer.
