By accepting this agreement online, you and Cimarex Energy Co. (the Company) agree that this Option is granted under and governed by the terms and conditions of the Companys 2011 Equity Incentive Plan and the Award Agreement (the Agreement), both of which are attached and made a part of this document.  In the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of the Plan and the terms and conditions of the Agreement, the terms and conditions of the Plan will prevail.
 






 
AWARD AGREEMENT
 
1.             Grant of Option.  The Company grants you a Nonqualified stock option (the Option) to purchase the number of shares of Common Stock as set forth in the attached Notice of Grant, at the exercise price per share set forth in the Notice of Grant (the Option Price).  The Option is not intended to qualify as an incentive stock option under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code).
 
2.             Option Term; Expiration Date.  The term of the Option is seven (7) years measured from the Date of Grant, unless sooner terminated under this Agreement or the Plan (the Expiration Date).
 
3.             Vesting.  The Option is only exercisable, in whole or in part, on or before the Expiration Date and then only with respect to the vested portion of the Option.
 
(a)           Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement and the Plan, the Option vests and becomes exercisable to purchase shares of Common Stock as set forth in the Notice of Grant.  Shares scheduled to vest on a certain date or upon the occurrence of a certain condition will not vest in accordance with any of the provisions of this Agreement unless you have been an employee (or other service provider) of the Company, a Subsidiary or an Affiliated Entity continuously from the Date of Grant until the date such vesting occurs.
 
(b)           Upon the occurrence of one of the following events, the Option will become immediately and automatically vested:
 
(i)            A Change of Control Event under the conditions described in the Plan; or
 
(ii)           Upon your death or Disability (as defined in the Plan).
 
4.             Termination of Employment  Option Exercise.  Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, the Option may be exercised upon termination of employment (or other service) on or before the Expiration Date as follows:
 
(a)           Upon your death or Disability, the vested portion of the Option may be exercised by you (or your personal representative in the case of death) during the remaining term of the Option, but in no event after the Expiration Date.
 
(b)           Upon your termination of employment (or other service) for any reason other than Cause, whether voluntary or involuntary, you may exercise the vested portion of the Option within three (3) months following the date of such termination, but in no event after the Expiration Date.
 
If your employment (or other service) with the Company is terminated for Cause prior to the Expiration Date, the entire Option, whether or not vested, shall become void, shall be forfeited and shall terminate immediately upon your termination of employment (or other service).  For this purpose, Cause shall mean a conviction (or pleading nolo contendere) of a felony or termination of employment (or other service) due to a violation of the Companys Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, as determined by the Committee (or its designee) in good faith (Cause).
 
5.             Exercising the Option.  The Option may be exercised on or before the Expiration Date in accordance with the Plan and the terms of this Agreement.  The Option may be exercised by delivery of a Notice of Exercise to the Companys Corporate Secretary (or his or her designee) and full payment of
 






 
the Option Price and satisfaction of applicable tax withholding.  The Notice of Exercise must identify the Option being exercised, the number of shares of Common Stock to be purchased and include any other information, and be in the form required by the Committee (or its designee) from time to time (the Notice of Exercise).
 
6.             Tax Withholding.  The issuance of Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of the Option is subject to the requirement that you make appropriate arrangements with the Company to provide for the amount of additional income and other tax withholding applicable to the exercise of the Option.  Subject to any election procedures and other requirements determined by the Company, you may pay the amount of taxes required by law to be withheld by directing the Company to withhold a number of shares of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value on the date of payment equal to the amount of the required tax withholding.
 
7.             Method of Payment.  The Option Price and tax withholding for shares of Common Stock purchased upon the exercise of the Option may be paid by the following methods:
 
(a)           in cash or by check, bank draft or money order payable to the order of the Company;
 
(b)           by delivering shares of Common Stock with a Fair Market Value on the date of payment equal to the amount of the Option Price, subject to such additional requirements determined by the Committee (or its designee);
 
(c)           payment through a transaction involving a licensed broker or dealer (acceptable to the Company) acting on your behalf to sell shares and deliver all or part of the sales proceeds to the Company in payment of the Option Price and applicable tax withholding, subject to such additional requirements determined by the Committee (or its designee);
 
(d)           payment of the exercise price and required tax withholding with shares of Common Stock acquired pursuant to the exercise (the Common Stock being valued at Fair Market Value on the date of exercise);
 
(e)           a combination of the foregoing; or
 
(f)            any other method of payment adopted by the Company in connection with the Plan and approved by the Committee prior to the time of exercise.
 
8.             Transferability.  You may not transfer the Option except by will or pursuant to the laws of descent and distribution, nor may you pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of the Option, by operation of law or otherwise.  The Option may be exercised during your life only by you, or in the event of your Disability or incapacity, by your guardian or legal representative and after your death, only by those entitled to do so under your will or the applicable laws of descent and distribution.
