2.           Registration.

 

(a)           On or before 45 days after the Closing Date, the Company agrees to use all commercially reasonable best efforts to prepare and file with the Commission a Registration Statement covering the resale of all of the Registrable Securities that are not then registered on an effective Registration Statement for an offering to be made on a continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 or, if Rule 415 is not available for offers and sales of the Registrable Securities, by such other means of distribution of Registrable Securities as the Holders may reasonably specify (the “Initial Registration Statement”). The Initial Registration Statement shall be on Form S-1 and shall contain (except if otherwise required pursuant to written comments received from the Commission upon a review of such Registration Statement) the “Plan of Distribution” section attached hereto as Annex A. Notwithstanding the registration obligations set forth in this subsection (a) and subsections (b) and (c) of this Section 2, in the event the Commission informs the Company that all of the Registrable Securities cannot, as a result of the application of Rule 415, be registered for resale as a secondary offering on a single registration statement, the Company agrees promptly (i) to inform each of the Holders thereof and use its commercially reasonable efforts to file amendments to the Initial Registration Statement as required by the Commission and/or (ii) to withdraw the Initial Registration Statement and file a new registration statement (a “New Registration Statement”), in either case covering the maximum number of Registrable Securities permitted to be registered by the Commission, on Form S-1 or such other form available to register for resale the Registrable Securities as a secondary offering; provided, however, that prior to filing such amendment or New Registration Statement, the Company shall be obligated to use its commercially reasonable efforts to advocate with the Commission for the registration of all of the Registrable Securities in accordance with the SEC Guidance. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any SEC Guidance sets forth a limitation of the number of Registrable Securities permitted to be registered on a particular Registration Statement as a secondary offering (and notwithstanding that the Company used commercially reasonable efforts to advocate with the Commission for the registration of all or a greater number of Registrable Securities), unless otherwise directed in writing by a Holder as to its Registrable Securities, the number of Registrable Securities to be registered on such Registration Statement will be reduced by Registrable Securities represented by Shares (applied, in the case that some Shares may be registered, to the Holders on a pro rata basis based on the total number of unregistered Shares held by such Holders, subject to a determination by the Commission that certain Holders must be reduced first based on the number of Shares held by such Holders). In the event the Company amends the Initial Registration Statement or files a New Registration Statement, as the case may be, under clauses (i) or (ii) above, the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to file with the Commission, as promptly as allowed by the Commission or the SEC Guidance provided to the Company or to registrants of securities in general, one or more registration statements on Form S-1 or such other form available to register for resale those Registrable Securities that were not registered for resale on the Initial Registration Statement, as amended, or the New Registration Statement (the “Remainder Registration Statements”) unless such registerable securities are eligible for sale by the Holder, without restriction, pursuant to Rule 144, in which event the Company will not be obligated to file any remainder Registration Statement.

(b)           Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Registration Statement to be declared effective by the Commission as soon as practicable following the filing thereof and, with respect to the Initial Registration Statement or the New Registration Statement, as applicable, (including filing with the Commission a request for acceleration of effectiveness in accordance with Rule 461 promulgated under the Securities Act within five (5) Business Days after the date that the Company is notified (orally or in writing, whichever is earlier) by the Commission that such Registration Statement will not be “reviewed,” or not be subject to further review and the effectiveness of such Registration Statement may be accelerated) and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep each Registration Statement continuously effective under the Securities Act until the later of (i) one year after the Closing Date or (ii) such time as all of the Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement have been sold thereunder or pursuant to Rule 144 or may be sold without restriction pursuant to Rule 144 including, without limitation, volume limitations and other restrictions of Rule 144 (the “Effectiveness Period”); provided, however, that the requirement of continuous effectiveness may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the then outstanding Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement. The Company shall ensure that each Registration Statement (including and as amended and modified by any amendments or supplements thereto and prospectuses contained therein) shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of prospectuses, in the light of the circumstances in which they were made) not misleading. Each Registration Statement shall also cover, to the extent allowable under the Securities Act and the rules promulgated thereunder (including Rule 416 under the Securities Act), such indeterminate number of additional shares of Common Stock resulting from stock splits, stock dividends or similar transactions with respect to the Registrable Securities. The Company shall request effectiveness of a Registration Statement as of 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the Effective Date. The Company shall promptly notify the Holders via facsimile or e-mail of the effectiveness of a Registration Statement within one (1) Business Day after the date on which the Company confirms effectiveness with the Commission, which confirmation shall initially be the date requested for effectiveness of a Registration Statement. The Company shall, by 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time on the first Trading Day after the Effective Date, file a Prospectus with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424.

 

(c)           The Company shall not, from the date hereof until the date that is 60 days after the Effective Date of the Registration Statement, prepare and file with the Commission a registration statement relating to an offering for its own account under the Securities Act of any of its equity securities other than a Special Registration Statement unless the closing bid price for the Common Stock on the Trading Day prior to the date of filing any such registration statement, as reported by the Principal Trading Market, was greater than the Purchase Price. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not be prohibited from preparing and filing with the Commission a registration statement relating to an offering of Common Stock by existing stockholders of the Company under the Securities Act pursuant to the terms of registration rights held by such stockholders.

(d)           Each Holder agrees to furnish to the Company a completed Selling Stockholder Questionnaire not more than ten (10) Trading Days following the date of this Agreement. Each Holder further agrees that it shall not be entitled to be named as a selling securityholder in a Registration Statement or use the Prospectus for offers and resales of Registrable Securities at any time, unless such Holder has returned to the Company a completed and signed Selling Stockholder Questionnaire. If a Holder of Registrable Securities returns a Selling Stockholder Questionnaire after the deadline specified in the first sentence of this Section 2(d), the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take such actions as are required to name such Holder as a selling security holder in the Registration Statement or any pre-effective or post-effective amendment thereto and to include (to the extent not theretofore included) in the Registration Statement the Registrable Securities identified in such late Selling Stockholder Questionnaire. Each Holder acknowledges and agrees that (i) the information in the Selling Stockholder Questionnaire will be used by the Company in the preparation of the Registration Statement and hereby consents to the inclusion of such information in the Registration Statement, and (ii) if the Holder does not complete the Selling Stockholder Questionnaire, or does not complete the Selling Stockholder Questionnaire by the time specified in the first sentence of this Section 2(d) and the Company does not name such Holder as a selling security holder in the Registration Statement or any pre-effective or post-effective amendment thereto or include (to the extent not theretofore included) in the Registration Statement the Registrable Securities identified in such late Selling Stockholder Questionnaire after the use of its commercially reasonable efforts to do so, then the Holder shall not be entitled to be named in a Registration Statement or to receive liquidated damages to the extent resulting from the failure of the Company to name such Holder in a Registration Statement.

 

3.           Registration Procedures.

 

In connection with the Company’s registration obligations hereunder, the Company shall:

 

(a)           Not less than five (5) Trading Days prior to the filing of a Registration Statement and not less than one (1) Trading Day prior to the filing of any related Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto (except for Annual Reports on Form 10-K, and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K and any similar or successor reports), the Company shall furnish to each Holder whose Registrable Securities are included in such Registration Statement or counsel designated by such Holders copies of such Registration Statement, Prospectus or amendment or supplement thereto, as proposed to be filed, which documents (other than those incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference) will be subject to the review of such Holder or such counsel (it being acknowledged and agreed that if a Holder does not object to or comment on the aforementioned documents within such five (5) Trading Days or one (1) Trading Day period, as the case may be, then the Holder shall be deemed to have consented to and approved the use of such documents). The Company shall not file any Registration Statement or amendment or supplement thereto in a form to which the Holders of at least a majority of the Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement reasonably object in good faith, provided that, the Company is notified of such objection in writing within the five (5) Trading Days or one (1) Trading Day period described above, as applicable.

(b)           (i) Prepare and file with the Commission such amendments (including post-effective amendments) and supplements to each Registration Statement and the Prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such Registration Statement continuously effective as to the applicable Registrable Securities for its Effectiveness Period and prepare and file with the Commission such additional Registration Statements in order to register for resale under the Securities Act all of the Registrable Securities; (ii) cause the related Prospectus to be amended or supplemented by any required Prospectus supplement (subject to the terms of this Agreement), and, as so supplemented or amended, to be filed pursuant to Rule 424; (iii) respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments received from the Commission with respect to each Registration Statement or any amendment thereto and, as promptly as reasonably practicable, provide the Holders true and complete copies of all correspondence from and to the Commission relating to such Registration Statement that pertains to the Holders as “Selling Stockholders” but not any comments that would result in the disclosure to the Holders of material and non-public information concerning the Company; and (iv) comply with the provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act with respect to the disposition of all Registrable Securities covered by a Registration Statement during the applicable Effectiveness Period (subject to the terms of this Agreement) with the intended methods of disposition by the Holders thereof as set forth in such Registration Statement as so amended or in such Prospectus as so supplemented;  provided, however, that each Purchaser shall be responsible for the delivery of the Prospectus to the Persons to whom such Purchaser sells any of the Shares (including in accordance with Rule 172 under the Securities Act), and each Purchaser agrees to dispose of Registrable Securities in compliance with the plan of distribution described in the Registration Statement and otherwise in compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws. In the case of amendments and supplements to a Registration Statement which are required to be filed pursuant to this Agreement (including pursuant to this Section 3(b)) by reason of the Company filing a report on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q or Form 8-K or any analogous report under the Exchange Act, the Company shall have incorporated such report by reference into such Registration Statement, if applicable, or shall file such amendments or supplements with the Commission as soon as reasonably practicable after the Exchange Act report which created the requirement for the Company to amend or supplement such Registration Statement was filed or, if later, when required pursuant to applicable federal securities laws.

(c) Notify the Holders (which notice shall, pursuant to clauses (iii) through (vi) hereof, be accompanied by an instruction to suspend the use of the Prospectus until the requisite changes have been made) as promptly as reasonably possible (and, in the case of (i)(A) below, not less than one (1) Trading Day prior to such filing, in the case of (iii) and (iv) below, not more than one (1) Trading Day after such issuance or receipt, in the case of (v) below, not less than one (1) Trading Day after a determination by the Company that the financial statements in any Registration Statement have become ineligible for inclusion therein and, in the case of (vi) below, not more than three (3) Trading Days after the occurrence or existence of such development) and (if requested by any such Person) confirm such notice in writing no later than one (1) Trading Day following the day (i)(A) when a Prospectus or any Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment to a Registration Statement is proposed to be filed; (B) when the Commission notifies the Company whether there will be a “review” of such Registration Statement and whenever the Commission comments in writing on any Registration Statement; and (C) with respect to each Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment, when the same has become effective; (ii) of any request by the Commission or any other federal or state governmental authority for amendments or supplements to a Registration Statement or Prospectus or for additional information that pertains to the Holders as “Selling Stockholders” or the “Plan of Distribution”; (iii) of the issuance by the Commission or any other federal or state governmental authority of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of a Registration Statement covering any or all of the Registrable Securities or the initiation of any Proceedings for that purpose; (iv) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification or exemption from qualification of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction, or the initiation or threatening of any Proceeding for such purpose; (v) of the occurrence of any event or passage of time that makes the financial statements included in a Registration Statement ineligible for inclusion therein or any statement made in such Registration Statement or Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference untrue in any material respect or that requires any revisions to such Registration Statement, Prospectus or other documents so that, in the case of such Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as the case may be, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of any Prospectus, form of prospectus or supplement thereto, in light of the circumstances under which they were made), not misleading; and (vi) the occurrence or existence of any pending development with respect to the Company that the Company believes may be material and that, in the determination of the Company, makes it not in the best interest of the Company to allow continued availability of a Registration Statement or Prospectus, provided  that any and all of such information shall remain confidential to each Holder until such information otherwise becomes public, unless disclosure by a Holder is required by law; provided, further, that notwithstanding each Holder’s agreement to keep such information confidential, the Holders make no acknowledgement that any such information is material, non-public information.

(f) Prior to any resale of Registrable Securities by a Holder, use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify, unless an exemption from registration and qualification applies, the Registrable Securities for offer and sale or resale under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions within the United States as any Holder reasonably requests in writing, to keep each such registration or qualification (or exemption therefrom) effective during the Effectiveness Period and to do any and all other acts or things reasonably necessary to enable the disposition in such jurisdictions of the Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statements; provided, that the Company shall not be required to qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not then so qualified or to take any action that would subject the Company to general service of process in any jurisdiction where it is not then so subject or subject the Company to any material tax in any such jurisdiction where it is not then so subject.


 

(g)           If requested by the Holders, cooperate with the Holders to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing Registrable Securities to be delivered to a transferee pursuant to the Registration Statement, which certificates shall be free, to the extent permitted by the Purchase Agreement and under law, of all restrictive legends, and to enable such Registrable Securities to be in such denominations and registered in such names as any such Holders may reasonably request. In connection therewith, if required by the Company’s transfer agent, the Company shall promptly after the effectiveness of the Registration Statement cause an opinion of counsel as to the effectiveness of the Registration Statement to be delivered to and maintained with its transfer agent, together with any other authorizations, certificates and directions required by the transfer agent, which authorize and direct the transfer agent to issue such Registrable Securities without legend upon sale by the holder of such shares of Registrable Securities under the Registration Statement.

(j)            In order to enable the Holders to sell Shares under Rule 144, for a period of one year from the Closing, the Company covenants to use commercially reasonable efforts to timely file (or obtain extensions in respect thereof and file within the applicable grace period) all reports required to be filed by the Company after the date hereof pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. During such one year period, if the Company is not required to file reports pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, it will prepare and furnish to the Holders and make publicly available in accordance with Rule 144(c) promulgated under the Securities Act annual and quarterly financial statements, together with a discussion and analysis of such financial statements in form and substance substantially similar to those that would otherwise be required to be included in reports required by Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as well as any other information required thereby, in the time period that such filings would have been required to have been made under the Exchange Act. The Company further covenants that it will use commercially reasonable efforts to take such further action as any Holder may reasonably request, to the extent required to enable such Holder to sell its Registrable Securities without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act if, and for such period of time during the Effectiveness Period when, a Registration Statement covering such Holder’s Registrable Securities is not effective, including compliance with the provisions of the Purchase Agreement relating to the transfer of the Shares.

 

(k)           The Company may require each selling Holder to furnish to the Company a certified statement as to (i) the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by such Holder and any Affiliate thereof, (ii) any FINRA affiliations, (iii) any natural persons who have the power to vote or dispose of the Common Stock and (iv) any other information as may be requested by the Commission, FINRA or any state securities commission. During any periods that the Company is unable to meet its obligations hereunder with respect to the registration of Registrable Securities because any Holder fails to furnish such information within three (3) Trading Days of the Company’s request, then any obligation that the Company has as to the Holder shall be suspended until such information is delivered to the Company.

 

(l)           The Company shall promptly deliver to each Holder, without charge, as many copies of the Prospectus or Prospectuses (including each form of prospectus) and each amendment or supplement thereto as such Persons may reasonably request, provided that the Company shall have no such obligation to deliver the Prospectus or Prospectuses that are available on the Commission’s EDGAR system.  The Company hereby consents to the use of such Prospectus and each amendment or supplement thereto by each of the Holders in connection with the offering and sale of the Registrable Securities covered by such Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto to the extent permitted by federal and state securities laws and regulations.

 

(m)           The Company shall comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the Commission under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, including, without limitation, Rule 172 under the Securities Act, file any final Prospectus, including any supplement or amendment thereof, with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act, promptly inform the Holders in writing if, at any time during the Effectiveness Period, the Company does not satisfy the conditions specified in Rule 172 and, as a result thereof, the Holders are required to make available a Prospectus in connection with any disposition of Registrable Securities and take such other actions as may be reasonably necessary to facilitate the registration of the Registrable Securities hereunder.

The Company shall, notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Holder, the officers, directors, agents, partners, members, managers, stockholders and employees of each of them, each Person who controls any such Holder (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) and the officers, directors, partners, members, managers, stockholders, agents and employees of each such controlling Person, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs (including, without limitation, reasonable costs of preparation and investigation and reasonable attorneys’ fees) and expenses (collectively, “Losses”), as incurred, to the extent arising out of or based upon (i) any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement, any Prospectus or any form of prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto (it being understood that the Holder has approved Annex A hereto for this purpose) or in any preliminary prospectus, or arising out of or relating to any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of any Prospectus or form of prospectus or supplement thereto, in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading or (ii) any violation or alleged violation by the Company of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any state securities law, or any rule or regulation thereunder relating to the offer or sale of the Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement or any violation of this Agreement; except in each of (i) and (ii) to the extent, but only to the extent, that (A) such untrue statements, alleged untrue statements, omissions or alleged omissions are based solely upon information regarding such Holder furnished in writing to the Company by such Holder expressly for use therein, or to the extent that such information relates to such Holder or such Holder’s proposed method of distribution of Registrable Securities and was reviewed and approved by such Holder expressly for use in the Registration Statement, such Prospectus or such form of Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto (it being understood that each Holder has approved Annex A hereto for this purpose), (B) in the case of an occurrence of an event of the type specified in Section 3(c)(iii)-(vi), related to the use by a Holder of an outdated or defective Prospectus after the Company has notified such Holder in writing that the Prospectus is outdated or defective and prior to the receipt by such Holder of the Advice contemplated and defined in Section 6(g) below, but only if and to the extent that following the receipt of the Advice the misstatement or omission giving rise to such Loss would have been corrected or (C) any such Losses arise out of the Holder’s (or any other Indemnified Party’s (as defined in Section 5(c))) failure to send or give a copy of the Prospectus or supplement (as then amended or supplemented) to the Persons asserting an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of Registrable Securities to such Person if such statement or omission was corrected in such Prospectus or supplement. The Company shall notify the Holders promptly of the institution, threat or assertion of any Proceeding arising from or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement of which the Company is aware. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of an Indemnified Party (as defined in Section 5(c)) and shall survive the transfer of the Registrable Securities by the Holders in accordance herewith.

(b)          Indemnification by Holders. Each Holder shall, notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement, severally and not jointly, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company, its directors, officers, agents and employees, each Person who controls the Company (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act), and the directors, officers, agents or employees of such controlling Persons, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, from and against all Losses, as incurred, to the extent arising out of or based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement, any Prospectus, or any form of prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any preliminary prospectus, or arising out of or relating to any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of any Prospectus, or any form of prospectus or supplement thereto, in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading (i) to the extent, but only to the extent that, such untrue statements, alleged untrue statements, omissions or alleged omissions are based solely upon information regarding such Holder furnished in writing to the Company by such Holder expressly for use therein, (ii) to the extent that such information relates to such Holder or such Holder’s proposed method of distribution of Registrable Securities and was reviewed and approved by such Holder expressly for use in the Registration Statement (it being understood that the Holder has approved Annex A hereto for this purpose), such Prospectus or such form of Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or (iii) in the case of an occurrence of an event of the type specified in Section 3(c)(iii)-(vi), to the extent related to the use by such Holder of an outdated or defective Prospectus after the Company has notified such Holder in writing that the Prospectus is outdated or defective and prior to the receipt by such Holder of the Advice contemplated in Section 6(g). In no event shall the liability of any selling Holder under this Section 5(b) be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the net proceeds received by such Holder upon the sale of the Registrable Securities giving rise to such indemnification obligation.

 

(c)           Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings. If any Proceeding shall be brought or asserted against any Person entitled to indemnity hereunder (an “Indemnified Party”), such Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Person from whom indemnity is sought (the “Indemnifying Party”) in writing, and the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and the payment of all reasonable fees and expenses incurred in connection with defense thereof; provided, that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations or liabilities pursuant to this Section 5, except (and only) to the extent that it shall be finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction (which determination is not subject to appeal or further review) that such failure shall have proximately and materially adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

 

An Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such Proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Party or Parties unless: (1) the Indemnifying Party has agreed in writing to pay such fees and expenses; (2) the Indemnifying Party shall have failed promptly to assume the defense of such Proceeding and to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party in any such Proceeding; or (3) the named parties to any such Proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, and such Indemnified Party shall have been advised by counsel that a conflict of interest exists if the same counsel were to represent such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party (in which case, if such Indemnified Party notifies the Indemnifying Party in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume the defense thereof and such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party); provided, that the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys at any time for all Indemnified Parties. The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement of any such Proceeding effected without its written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. No Indemnifying Party shall, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, effect any settlement of any pending Proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Party is a party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such Proceeding.

 

 

 




  



13







  




Subject to the terms of this Agreement, all fees and expenses of the Indemnified Party (including reasonable fees and expenses to the extent incurred in connection with investigating or preparing to defend such Proceeding in a manner not inconsistent with this Section) shall be paid to the Indemnified Party, as incurred, within twenty (20) Trading Days of written notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party; provided, that the Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for that portion of such fees and expenses applicable to such actions for which such Indemnified Party is finally judicially determined to not be entitled to indemnification hereunder. The failure to deliver written notice to the Indemnifying Party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action shall not relieve such Indemnifying Party of any liability to the Indemnified Party under this Section 5, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced in its ability to defend such action.

 

(d)           Contribution. If a claim for indemnification under Section 5(a) or 5(b) is unavailable to an Indemnified Party (by reason of public policy or otherwise), then each Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such Losses, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party in connection with the actions, statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission of a material fact, has been taken or made by, or relates to information supplied by, such Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party, and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action, statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of any Losses shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, any reasonable attorneys’ or other reasonable fees or expenses incurred by such party in connection with any Proceeding to the extent such party would have been indemnified for such fees or expenses if the indemnification provided for in this Section was available to such party in accordance with its terms.

 

The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 5(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5(d), (A) no Holder shall be required to contribute, in the aggregate, any amount in excess of the amount by which the net proceeds actually received by such Holder from the sale of the Registrable Securities subject to the Proceeding exceeds the amount of any damages that such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission and (B) no contribution will be made under circumstances where the maker of such contribution would not have been required to indemnify the Indemnified Party under the fault standards set forth in this Section 5. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

 

The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section are in addition to any liability that the Indemnifying Parties may have to the Indemnified Parties and are not in diminution or limitation of the indemnification provisions under the Purchase Agreement.

6. Miscellaneous.

  

(a)           Remedies. In the event of a breach by the Company or by a Holder of any of their obligations under this Agreement, each Holder or the Company, as the case may be, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by law and under this Agreement, including recovery of damages, will be entitled to specific performance of its rights under this Agreement. The Company and each Holder agree that monetary damages would not provide adequate compensation for any losses incurred by reason of a breach by it of any of the provisions of this Agreement and hereby further agrees that, in the event of any action for specific performance in respect of such breach, it shall waive the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate.


 

(b)           No Piggyback on Registrations. Except for (i) the shares of common stock sold in the offering commenced by the Company on December 17, 2013, as well as shares of common stock underlying warrants sold in that offering, (ii) the shares of common stock underlying warrants sold in the offering commenced by the Company in February, 2011, and/or (iii) as provided in the SEC Reports, neither the Company nor any of its security holders (other than the Holders in such capacity pursuant hereto and for a period of no longer than one (1) year from the Closing Date) may include securities of the Company in a Registration Statement other than the Registrable Securities, and the Company shall not prior to the Effective Date enter into any agreement providing any such right to any of its security holders.  Nothing in this Section 6(b) shall limit the Company’s ability to include securities of the Company other than the Registrable Securities in a registration statement that is not a Registration Statement and file any such registration statement with the Commission, except as is expressly prohibited by this Agreement.

 

(c)           Entire Agreement. This Agreement is intended by the parties as a final expression of their agreement and intended to be a complete and exclusive statement of the agreement and understanding of the parties hereto in respect of the subject matter contained herein. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings between the parties with respect to such subject matter, except for, and as provided in the Transaction Documents.

 

(d)           Compliance. Each Holder covenants and agrees that it will comply with the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act as applicable to it (unless an exemption therefrom is available) in connection with sales of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement and shall sell the Registrable Securities only in accordance with a method of distribution described in the Registration Statement.

 

(e)           Suspension of Trading. At any time after the Registrable Securities are covered by an effective Registration Statement, the Company may deliver to the Holders of such Registrable Securities a certificate (the “Suspension Certificate”) approved by the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer of the Company and signed by an officer of the Company stating that the effectiveness of and sales of Registrable Securities under the Registration Statement would:

 

(i)           materially interfere with any transaction that would require the Company to prepare financial statements under the Securities Act that the Company would otherwise not be required to prepare in order to comply with its obligations under the Exchange Act, or

 

(ii)           require public disclosure of a material transaction or event prior to the time such disclosure might otherwise be required.

 




  



15







  




Upon receipt of a Suspension Certificate by Holders of Registrable Securities, such Holders of Registrable Securities shall refrain from selling or otherwise transferring or disposing of any Registrable Securities then held by such Holders for a specified period of time (a “Suspension Period”) that is customary under the circumstances (not to exceed twenty (20) days). Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Company shall be permitted to cause Holders of Registrable Securities to so refrain from selling or otherwise transferring or disposing of any Registrable Securities for the reasons set forth in clause (i) and (ii) of this Section 6(e) on only two (2) occasions during each twelve (12) consecutive month period that the Registration Statement remains effective with no less than sixty (60) calendar days in between Suspension Periods; provided that nothing in this sentence shall be construed to limit the Company’s ability to suspend the effectiveness of a Registration Statement and/or cause the Holders to suspend dispositions of the Registrable Securities thereunder as provided in this Agreement for reasons other than those set forth in clause (i) and (ii) of this Section 6(e). The Company may impose stop transfer instructions to enforce any required agreement of the Holders under this Section 6(e).  Immediately after the end of any Suspension Period, provided that the Effectiveness Period continues at such time, the Company shall take all necessary actions (including filing any required supplemental prospectus) to restore the effectiveness of the applicable Registration Statement and the ability of the Holders to publicly resell, pursuant to such effective Registration Statement, their Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement.

 

(f)           Piggyback Registrations. If, at any time during the Effectiveness Period, there is not an effective Registration Statement covering Registrable Securities and the Company shall determine to prepare and file with the Commission a registration statement relating to an offering for its own account or the account of others under the Securities Act of any of its equity securities, other than on a Special Registration Statement, then the Company shall deliver to each Holder a written notice of such determination and, if within seven days after the date of the delivery of such notice, any such Holder shall so request in writing, the Company shall include in such registration statement all or any part of such Registrable Securities such Holder requests to be registered; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to register any Registrable Securities pursuant to this Section 6(f) that are (i) eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144 without volume or manner-of-sale restrictions or (ii) the subject of a then-effective Registration Statement.

 

(g)           Discontinued Disposition. Each Holder hereby expressly makes the acknowledgements and agreements set forth in Section 4.1(c) of the Purchase Agreement with respect to any Registrable Securities.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Holder further agrees by its acquisition of Registrable Securities that, upon receipt of a notice from the Company of the occurrence of any event of the kind described in Section 3(c)(iii)-(vi), such Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of such Registrable Securities under the Registration Statement until it is advised in writing (the “Advice”) by the Company that the use of the applicable Prospectus (as it may have been supplemented or amended) may be resumed. The Company may provide appropriate stop orders to enforce the provisions of this Section 6(g).

 

 

 




  



16







  




(h)          Amendments and Waivers. The provisions of this Agreement, including the provisions of this sentence, may not be amended, modified, supplemented or waived unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Company and Holders holding at least a majority of the then outstanding Registrable Securities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver or consent to depart from the provisions hereof with respect to a matter that relates exclusively to the rights of a Holder or some Holders and that does not directly or indirectly affect the rights of other Holders may be given by Holders of all of the Registrable Securities to which such waiver or consent relates; provided, however, that the provisions of this sentence may not be amended, modified or supplemented except in accordance with the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence.

 

(i)           Term. The registration rights provided to the Holders of Registrable Securities hereunder, and the Company’s obligation to keep the Registration Statements effective, shall terminate at the end of the Effectiveness Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Section 4, Section 5, Section 6(j), Section 6(m), Section 6(n), Section 6(o), Section 6(p), Section 6(q) and Section 6(r) shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

 

(j)           Notices. Any and all notices or other communications or deliveries required or permitted to be provided hereunder shall be delivered as set forth in the Purchase Agreement.

 

(k)           Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors and permitted assigns of each of the parties and shall inure to the benefit of each Holder. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any party other than the parties hereto or their respective successors and assigns any rights, remedies, obligations, or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, except as expressly provided in this Agreement. The Company may not assign its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of all the Holders of the then outstanding Registrable Securities (other than by merger or consolidation or to an entity which acquires the Company including by way of acquiring all or substantially all of the Company’s assets). The rights of the Holders hereunder, including the right to have the Company register Registrable Securities pursuant to this Agreement, may be assigned by each Holder to transferees or assignees of all or any portion of the Registrable Securities (but only with all related obligations) that after such assignment holds at least 20,000 shares of Registrable Securities (subject to appropriate adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, combinations and other recapitalizations), but only if (i) the Holder agrees in writing with the transferee or assignee to assign such rights and related obligations under this Agreement, and for the transferee or assignee to assume such obligations, and a copy of such agreement is furnished to the Company within a reasonable time after such assignment, (ii) the Company is, within a reasonable time after such transfer or assignment, furnished with written notice of the name and address of such transferee or assignee and the securities with respect to which such registration rights are being transferred or assigned, (iii) at or before the time the Company received the written notice contemplated by clause (ii) of this sentence, the transferee or assignee agrees in writing with the Company to be bound by all of the provisions contained herein that apply to the “Holders”, (iv) the transfer or assignment is in compliance with an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, and (v) the transferee is an “accredited investor,” as that term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D.

(l)             Execution and Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and, all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same Agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each party and delivered to the other party, it being understood that both parties need not sign the same counterpart. In the event that any signature is delivered by facsimile transmission or by e-mail delivery of a “.pdf” format data file, such signature shall create a valid and binding obligation of the party executing (or on whose behalf such signature is executed) with the same force and effect as if such facsimile or “.pdf” signature were the original thereof.

 

(m)           Governing Law. All questions concerning the construction, validity, enforcement and interpretation of this Agreement shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Purchase Agreement.

 

(n)           Cumulative Remedies. The remedies provided herein are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

 

(o)           Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions set forth herein shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and the parties hereto shall use their reasonable efforts to find and employ an alternative means to achieve the same or substantially the same result as that contemplated by such term, provision, covenant or restriction. It is hereby stipulated and declared to be the intention of the parties that they would have executed the remaining terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions without including any of such that may be hereafter declared invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable.

 

(p)           Headings. The headings in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning hereof.

(s)           Counsel. Each Purchaser acknowledges that: (i) it has read this Agreement; (ii) it has been represented in the preparation, negotiation and execution of this Agreement by legal counsel of its own choice or has voluntarily declined to seek such counsel; and (iii) it understands the terms and consequences of this Agreement and is fully aware of the legal and binding effect of this Agreement.

Annex A

 

PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION

 

We are registering the shares of common stock issued to the selling stockholders to permit the resale of these shares of common stock by the holders of the shares of common stock from time to time after the date of this prospectus. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale by the selling stockholders of the shares of common stock. We will bear all fees and expenses incident to our obligation to register the shares of common stock.

 

The selling stockholders may sell all or a portion of the shares of common stock beneficially owned by them and offered hereby from time to time directly or through one or more underwriters, broker-dealers or agents. If the shares of common stock are sold through underwriters or broker-dealers, the selling stockholders will be responsible for underwriting discounts or commissions or agent’s commissions. The shares of common stock may be sold on any national securities exchange or quotation service on which the securities may be listed or quoted at the time of sale, in the over-the-counter market or in transactions otherwise than on these exchanges or systems or in the over-the-counter market and in one or more transactions at fixed prices, at prevailing market prices at the time of the sale, at varying prices determined at the time of sale, or at negotiated prices. These sales may be effected in transactions, which may involve crosses or block transactions. The selling stockholders may use any one or more of the following methods when selling shares:

 





  


·


ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker-dealer solicits purchasers;




 





  


·


block trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the shares as agent but may position and resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction;




 





  


·


purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for its account;




 





  


·


an exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange;




 





  


·


privately negotiated transactions;




 





  


·


settlement of short sales entered into after the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part;




 





  


·


broker-dealers may agree with the selling stockholders to sell a specified number of such shares at a stipulated price per share;




 





  


·


through the writing or settlement of options or other hedging transactions, whether such options are listed on an options exchange or otherwise;




 





  


·


a combination of any such methods of sale; and




 




  



20







  








  


·


any other method permitted pursuant to applicable law.




 

The selling stockholders also may resell all or a portion of the shares in open market transactions in reliance upon Rule 144 under the Securities Act, as permitted by that rule, or Section 4(1) under the Securities Act, if available, rather than under this prospectus, provided that they meet the criteria and conform to the requirements of those provisions.

 

Broker-dealers engaged by the selling stockholders may arrange for other broker-dealers to participate in sales. If the selling stockholders effect such transactions by selling shares of common stock to or through underwriters, broker-dealers or agents, such underwriters, broker-dealers or agents may receive commissions in the form of discounts, concessions or commissions from the selling stockholders or commissions from purchasers of the shares of common stock for whom they may act as agent or to whom they may sell as principal. Such commissions will be in amounts to be negotiated, but, except as set forth in a supplement to this Prospectus, in the case of an agency transaction will not be in excess of a customary brokerage commission in compliance with FINRA Rule 5110.

 

In connection with sales of the shares of common stock or otherwise, the selling stockholders may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions, which may in turn engage in short sales of the shares of common stock in the course of hedging in positions they assume. The selling stockholders may also sell shares of common stock short and if such short sale shall take place after the date that this Registration Statement is declared effective by the Commission, the selling stockholders may deliver shares of common stock covered by this prospectus to close out short positions and to return borrowed shares in connection with such short sales. The selling stockholders may also loan or pledge shares of common stock to broker-dealers that in turn may sell such shares, to the extent permitted by applicable law. The selling stockholders may also enter into option or other transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions or the creation of one or more derivative securities which require the delivery to such broker-dealer or other financial institution of shares offered by this prospectus, which shares such broker-dealer or other financial institution may resell pursuant to this prospectus (as supplemented or amended to reflect such transaction). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the selling stockholders have been advised that they may not use shares registered on this registration statement to cover short sales of our common stock made prior to the date the registration statement, of which this prospectus forms a part, has been declared effective by the SEC.

 

The selling stockholders may, from time to time, pledge or grant a security interest in some or all of the warrants or shares of common stock owned by them and, if they default in the performance of their secured obligations, the pledgees or secured parties may offer and sell the shares of common stock from time to time pursuant to this prospectus or any amendment to this prospectus under Rule 424(b)(3) or other applicable provision of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, amending, if necessary, the list of selling stockholders to include the pledgee, transferee or other successors in interest as selling stockholders under this prospectus. The selling stockholders also may transfer and donate the shares of common stock in other circumstances in which case the transferees, donees, pledgees or other successors in interest will be the selling beneficial owners for purposes of this prospectus.

 




  



21







  




The selling stockholders and any broker-dealer or agents participating in the distribution of the shares of common stock may be deemed to be “underwriters” within the meaning of Section 2(11) of the Securities Act in connection with such sales. In such event, any commissions paid, or any discounts or concessions allowed to, any such broker-dealer or agent and any profit on the resale of the shares purchased by them may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the Securities Act. Selling Stockholders who are “underwriters” within the meaning of Section 2(11) of the Securities Act will be subject to the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act and may be subject to certain statutory liabilities of, including but not limited to, Sections 11, 12 and 17 of the Securities Act and Rule 10b-5 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act.

 

Each selling stockholder has informed the Company that it is not a registered broker-dealer and does not have any written or oral agreement or understanding, directly or indirectly, with any person to distribute the common stock. Upon the Company being notified in writing by a selling stockholder that any material arrangement has been entered into with a broker-dealer for the sale of common stock through a block trade, special offering, exchange distribution or secondary distribution or a purchase by a broker or dealer, a supplement to this prospectus will be filed, if required, pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act, disclosing (i) the name of each such selling stockholder and of the participating broker-dealer(s), (ii) the number of shares involved, (iii) the price at which such the shares of common stock were sold, (iv) the commissions paid or discounts or concessions allowed to such broker-dealer(s), where applicable, (v) that such broker-dealer(s) did not conduct any investigation to verify the information set out or incorporated by reference in this prospectus, and (vi) other facts material to the transaction. In no event shall any broker-dealer receive fees, commissions and markups, which, in the aggregate, would exceed eight percent (8%).

 

Under the securities laws of some states, the shares of common stock may be sold in such states only through registered or licensed brokers or dealers. In addition, in some states the shares of common stock may not be sold unless such shares have been registered or qualified for sale in such state or an exemption from registration or qualification is available and is complied with.

 

There can be no assurance that any selling stockholder will sell any or all of the shares of common stock registered pursuant to the shelf registration statement, of which this prospectus forms a part.

 

Each selling stockholder and any other person participating in such distribution will be subject to applicable provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder, including, without limitation, Regulation M of the Exchange Act, which may limit the timing of purchases and sales of any of the shares of common stock by the selling stockholder and any other participating person. Regulation M may also restrict the ability of any person engaged in the distribution of the shares of common stock to engage in market-making activities with respect to the shares of common stock. All of the foregoing may affect the marketability of the shares of common stock and the ability of any person or entity to engage in market-making activities with respect to the shares of common stock.

 




  



22

***********

 

The undersigned agrees to promptly notify the Company of any inaccuracies or changes in the information provided herein that may occur subsequent to the date hereof and prior to the effective date of any applicable Registration Statement and at any time while the Registration Statement remains effective. All notices hereunder and pursuant to the Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement shall be made in writing and delivered as set forth in the Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement. In the absence of any such notification, the Company shall be entitled to rely and continue to rely on the accuracy of the information in this Notice and Questionnaire.

 

By signing below, the undersigned consents to the disclosure of the information contained herein in its answers to Items (1) through (7) above and the inclusion of such information in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus. The undersigned understands that such information will be relied upon by the Company in connection with the preparation or amendment of any such Registration Statement and the Prospectus.

 

By signing below, the undersigned acknowledges that it understands its obligation to comply, and agrees that it will comply, with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, particularly Regulation M in connection with any offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement. The undersigned also acknowledges that it understands that the answers to this Questionnaire are furnished for use in connection with the Registration Statement filed pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement and any amendments or supplements thereto filed with the Commission pursuant to the Securities Act.

The undersigned hereby acknowledges and is advised of the following Division of Corporation Financing Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 239.10 regarding short selling:

 

“An issuer filed a Form S-1 registration statement for a secondary offering of common stock which is not yet effective. One of the selling shareholders wanted to do a short sale of common stock “against the box” and cover the short sale with registered shares after the effective date. The issuer was advised that the short sale could not be made before the registration statement becomes effective, because the shares underlying the short sale are deemed to be sold at the time such sale is made. There would, therefore, be a violation of Section 5 if the shares were effectively sold prior to the effective date.”

 

By returning this Questionnaire, the undersigned will be deemed to be aware of the foregoing interpretation.  The acknowledgements by and agreements of the Selling Stockholder set forth in this Notice and Questionnaire shall be in addition to, and shall not limit the scope and applicability of, the representations, warranties and covenants made by such Selling Stockholder in the Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement.

 

I confirm that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, the foregoing statements (including without limitation the answers to this Questionnaire) are correct and complete.

 

In Witness Whereof the undersigned, by authority duly given, has caused this Notice and Questionnaire to be executed and delivered either in person or by its duly authorized agent.
