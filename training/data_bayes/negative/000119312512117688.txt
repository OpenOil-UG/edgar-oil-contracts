(b)
No Waiver. Except for the notice described in Section 4(f), no failure by either the Company or Employee at any time to give notice of any breach by the
other of, or to require compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver of any provisions or condition of this Agreement. 
 


 
(c)
Arbitration and Governing Law. ANY UNRESOLVED DISPUTE OR CONTROVERSY BETWEEN EMPLOYEE AND THE COMPANY ARISING UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS EMPLOYMENT
AGREEMENT SHALL BE SETTLED EXCLUSIVELY BY ARBITRATION, CONDUCTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RULES OF THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION THEN IN EFFECT. THE COMPANY WILL BEAR THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OF ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT,
INCLUDING THE ARBITRATORS FEES. THE ARBITRATOR SHALL NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ADD TO, DETRACT FROM, OR MODIFY ANY PROVISION HEREOF. THE ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ORDER REMEDIES WHICH EMPLOYEE COULD OBTAIN IN A COURT OF COMPETENT
JURISDICTION. A DECISION BY THE ARBITRATOR SHALL BE IN WRITING AND WILL BE FINAL AND BINDING. JUDGMENT MAY BE ENTERED ON THE ARBITRATORS AWARD IN ANY COURT HAVING JURISDICTION. THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDING SHALL BE HELD IN HOUSTON, TEXAS, UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE COMPANY SHALL BE ENTITLED TO SEEK INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF FROM ANY COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION, WITHOUT THE NEED TO RESORT TO ARBITRATION IN THE EVENT THAT EMPLOYEE VIOLATES
SECTIONS 5(b), 5(c), 5(d) OR 5(e) OF THIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT. THIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT SHALL IN ALL RESPECTS BE CONSTRUED ACCORDING TO THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS. 
 


 
(d)
 Assignment by the Company; Meaning of Company. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company and any
successor to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company. The Company may assign this Agreement to any affiliate or successor, and no such assignment shall be treated as a termination of Employees employment under this
Agreement; provided, however, that in the case of an assignment to an affiliate, the Company shall not be relieved of its obligations under this Agreement. The Company will require any successor corporation (whether direct or indirect, and whether
by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company to expressly assume and to agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent as the Company, as if

   13 









 

no such succession had taken place. Failure of the Company to obtain such assumption and agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall be a material breach of this Agreement.
As used in this Agreement, Company shall mean the Company as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its business or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement by operation of law, or otherwise.
  


 
(e)
Assignment by Employee. Employees rights and obligations under this Agreement are personal, and they shall not be assigned or transferred without the
Companys prior written consent.   


 
(f)
Other Agreements. With the exception of the Companys stock option plans (and related agreements), restricted stock plan (and related agreements) and
incentive plans, and the guidelines referred to in Section 3(b), this Agreement replaces and merges any and all previous agreements and understandings regarding all the terms and conditions of Employees employment relationship with the
Company, and this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the Company and Employee with respect to such terms and conditions.   


 
(g)
Amendment. No amendment to this Agreement shall be effective unless it is in writing and signed by the Company and by Employee. 
 


 
(h)
Invalidity. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or otherwise unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall be unaffected and shall
continue in full force and effect, and there shall be deemed substituted for the provision at issue a valid, legal and enforceable provision as similar as possible to the provision at issue. 
 


 
(i)
Enforceability by Beneficiaries. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective heirs, legal or
personal representatives and successors and if Employee should die while any amount would still be payable to him hereunder if he had continued to live, all such amounts shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to Employees
devisee, legatee or other designee or, if there is no such designee, to his estate.   


 
(j)
 Reimbursement of Certain Expenses. To the extent Employee shall prevail in any arbitration proceeding pursuant to Section 6(c) to resolve
any dispute or controversy between Employee and the Company arising under or in connection with this Agreement, then the Company shall reimburse Employee, or pay on Employees behalf, all of Employees reasonable expenses, including
without limitation attorneys fees, incurred by Employee in connection with the arbitration. The amount of such expenses eligible for reimbursement during Employees taxable year will not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement in
any other taxable year. The Company shall reimburse an eligible expense pursuant to this Section 6(j) on or before the last day of Employees taxable year following the taxable year in which the expense was incurred. Notwithstanding

   14 









 

any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any amounts to which the Employee would otherwise be entitled under this Section 6(j) during the first six months following the date of the
Employees Separation From Service shall be accumulated and paid to the Employee on the date that is six months following the date of his Separation From Service. Employees right to reimbursement under this Section 6(j) is not
subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.   


7.

is a novation to the Amended and Restated Agreement between the Company and Employee effective September 15, 2005, which is hereby extinguished. As consideration for this novation, Employee acknowledges the value of the matters described in the
recitals to this Agreement and the other terms of this Agreement and agrees that they are adequate to make the novation binding in all respects.  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company and Employee have executed this Agreement in multiple originals to be effective as set out above.
