III.
Miscellaneous Provisions. 
1. In order to induce the Lenders to enter into this Fourth Amendment, each of Holdings and the Borrower hereby represents and warrants
that:  (i) all of the representations and warranties contained in the Credit Documents are true and correct in
all material respects both before and immediately after giving effect to the Fourth Amendment Effective Date, with the same effect as though such representations and warranties had been made on and as of the Fourth Amendment Effective Date (it being
understood that any representation or warranty made as of a specific date shall be true and correct in all material respects as of such specific date); and  (ii) no Default or Event of Default exists before or immediately after giving effect to the amendments set forth in this Fourth Amendment on the Fourth Amendment Effective Date. 
2. This Fourth Amendment is limited as specified herein and shall not constitute a modification, acceptance or waiver of any other
provision of the Credit Documents, all of which other provisions are hereby ratified and confirmed and are in full force and effect. Each Credit Party party to this Fourth Amendment acknowledges and agrees that all Guaranteed Obligations (as defined
in the Subsidiaries Guaranty after giving effect to this Fourth Amendment) remain secured by the Security Documents and that the Secured Creditors remain entitled to the benefits of the Security Documents. 
3. This Fourth Amendment may be executed in any number of counterparts and by the different parties hereto on separate counterparts, each
of which counterparts when executed and delivered (including by way of facsimile or other electronic transmission) shall be an original, but all of which shall together constitute one and the same instrument. A complete set of counterparts shall be
lodged with the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. 
   4 





 4. THIS FOURTH AMENDMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK (WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF LAWS RULES AND PRINCIPLES THEREUNDER OTHER THAN SECTIONS 5-1401 AND 5-1402 OF THE NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW). 
5. The Fourth Amendment shall become effective on the date (the Fourth Amendment Effective Date) when each of the following
conditions shall have been satisfied:  (i) the Credit Parties, the Administrative Agent and the Required

reimbursed the Administrative Agent for all reasonable and documented out-of pocket legal expenses of White & Case LLP incurred in connection with the Credit Agreement (including, without limitation, in connection with this Fourth
Amendment) and invoiced on or before the date hereof, (b) to the Administrative Agent, for the account of each Lender that delivers a counterpart signature page to this Fourth Amendment at or prior to 12.00 noon, New York City time, on

Fourth Amendment Effective Date, and, once paid, shall be non-refundable, and (c) any other fees then due and payable in connection with this Fourth Amendment.  6. From and after the Fourth Amendment Effective Date, all references in each Credit Document to the Credit Agreement shall be deemed to be references to the Credit Agreement as modified

the parties hereto, this Fourth Amendment may only be changed, modified or varied by written instrument in accordance with the requirements for the modification of Credit Documents pursuant to Section 11.12 of the Credit Agreement. 
8. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any failure by Holdings or Borrower to comply with the
requirements of Part II of this Fourth Amendment (including, without limitation, clauses (a) through (d) of Section 1 of Part II hereof) shall constitute an immediate Event of Default under Section 9.03 of the Credit Agreement.
