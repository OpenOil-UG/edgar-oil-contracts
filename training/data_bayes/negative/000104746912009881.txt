APPENDIX E
 
RIG ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
 
Rig Acceptance Testing means those procedures, maneuvers, tests, and other actions that Contractor shall perform at Operators direction to evidence the Rigs satisfaction of the Rig Acceptance Criteria, and serves as the final verification that systems are fit for purpose and installed and working in an acceptable manner.  Rig Acceptance Testing is designed to demonstrate this readiness.  In addition, a significant goal of the Rig Acceptance Testing is to ensure that Contractors Personnel are suitably trained and competent in the operation of the Rig and the performance of the Work, and that the necessary documentation, such as risk assessments and work instructions, are in place.  The procedures, maneuvers, tests, and other actions set out operational steps in a form that allows the Rig Acceptance Testing to be performed safely, effectively and efficiently.  As a result, many of the Rig Acceptance Testing procedures, maneuvers, tests, and other actions are jointly developed, prepared, and mutually agreed by Operator and Contractor, and in accordance with Good Industry Practice.
 
Therefore, as of the Effective Date, all of the Rig Acceptance Testing procedures, maneuvers, tests, and other actions are not available for this Appendix E.  For many systems, procedures may be developed and drafted, or revised, jointly between the Operator and Contractor during other Rig Acceptance Testing procedures, maneuvers, tests, or other actions.  Critical systems (some of which are described below) must be tested and proven before the Rig can be accepted.  Contractor acknowledges and agrees that the below descriptions do not constitute the entirety of the Rig Acceptance Testing procedures, maneuvers, tests, and other actions nor the exclusive systems to be tested and/or tests to be performed, and that the below may be amended, revised, or supplemented by Operator.
