PARTNERS; PARTNERSHIP UNITS
 
Section 3.1. Partners.  The Limited Partners and the General Partner are the sole Partners of the Partnership as of the date hereof.
 
Section 3.2. Partnership Interests; Issuances of Additional Units.  Interests in the Partnership shall be represented by Units or such other Partnership securities as the Board of Supervisors may establish in its sole discretion in accordance with the terms hereof.  In addition to the Units, the Board of Supervisors may create other equity interests in the Partnership or other Partnership securities from time to time in accordance with such procedures and subject to such conditions and restrictions and with such rights, obligations, powers, designations, preferences and other terms, which may be senior to the Units, any then existing or future equity interests in the Partnership or other Partnership securities, as the Board of Supervisors shall determine from time to time in its sole discretion, without the vote or consent of any Limited Partner or any other Person, including (i) the right of such Units, other equity interests or other Partnership securities to share in Net Income and Net Loss or items thereof; (ii) the right of such Units, other equity interests or other Partnership securities to share in Partnership distributions; (iii) the rights of such Units, other equity interests or other Partnership securities upon dissolution and liquidation of the Partnership; (iv) whether, and the terms and conditions upon which, the Partnership may or shall be required to redeem such Units or other equity interests or other Partnership securities (including sinking fund provisions); (v) whether such Units, other equity interests or other Partnership securities are issued with the privilege of conversion or exchange and, if so, the terms and conditions of such conversion or exchange; (vi) the terms and conditions upon which such Units, other equity interests or other Partnership securities will be issued, evidenced by certificates and assigned or transferred; (vii) the method for determining the total Percentage Interest as to such Units or other equity interests or other Partnership securities; (viii) the terms and conditions of the issuance of such Units, other equity interests or other Partnership securities; and (ix) the right, if any, of the holder of such Units, other equity interests or other Partnership securities to vote on Partnership matters, including matters relating to the relative designations, preferences, rights, powers and duties of such Units, other equity interests or other Partnership securities. The Board of Supervisors, without the vote or consent of any Limited Partner or any other Person, is authorized to amend this Agreement to reflect the issuance of Units or the creation of any other equity interests or other Partnership securities, and the admission of any Person as a Limited Partner which has received Units or other equity interests or Partnership securities, in accordance with Section 3.4.  All Units shall have identical rights in all respects as all other Units, except in each case as otherwise specified in this Agreement.
 
Section 3.3. Register.  The register of the Partnership shall be the definitive record of ownership of each Unit and all relevant information with respect to each Partner. Unless the Board of Supervisors shall determine otherwise, Units shall be uncertificated and recorded in the books and records of the Partnership.

Section 3.4. Transfer of a Limited Partner Interest.
 
(a)           Except as part of a division of property under a court order, no Limited Partner may Assign all or any part of its Partnership Interests in the Partnership without the approval of the Board of Supervisors, acting in its sole discretion.
 
(b)           Notwithstanding clause (a) above, any Limited Partner who is an individual may transfer by way of gift all or any portion of its Partnership Interest to a Family Member of such Partner or to a trust or other entity whose sole and exclusive beneficiaries are such Partner and/or Family Members of such Partner, but only to the extent (A) such transferee executes and delivers to the Partnership an Adoption Agreement for Family Members in the form attached as Exhibit B hereto, and (B) the Board of Supervisors consents to such transfer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
 
(c)           Notwithstanding clause (a) above, (i) each Limited Partner (other than Athlon Energy) may transfer its Units or any portion thereof for shares of Common Stock in an Exchange Transaction.
 
(d)           The Limited Partners agree, upon request of the Board of Supervisors, to execute such certificates or other documents and perform such acts as the Board of Supervisors reasonably deems appropriate to preserve the status of the Partnership as a limited partnership, after the completion of any permitted transfer of an interest in the Partnership, under the laws of the State of Delaware.
 
(e)           All Net Income and Net Loss of the Partnership attributable to any Partnership Interest acquired by reason of any transfer of such Partnership Interest shall be allocated among the transferor and transferee as if the books of the Partnership were closed on the date of the transfer and (i) in respect of the period ending on or before the date of the transfer, to the transferor and (ii) in respect of the period beginning the day after the date of transfer, to the transferee. All distributions on or before the date of such transfer shall be made to transferor, and all distributions thereafter shall be made to the transferee. The effective date of any transfer permitted under this Agreement shall be the close of business on the day the Partnership is notified of the Transfer.
 
(f)            The death, retirement, incompetence, bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, removal, expulsion or withdrawal of a Limited Partner shall not cause (in and of itself) a dissolution of the Partnership, but the rights of such a Limited Partner to share in the Net Income and Net Loss of the Partnership, to receive distributions and to assign its Partnership Interest pursuant to this Section 3.4, on the happening of such an event, shall devolve on its beneficiary or other successor, executor, administrator, guardian or other legal representative for the purpose of settling its estate or administering its property, and the Partnership shall continue as a limited partnership. Such successor or personal representative, however, shall become a Substituted Limited Partner only upon compliance with the requirements of Article III hereof with respect to a transferee of a Partnership Interest. The estate of a bankrupt Limited Partner shall be liable for all the obligations of the Limited Partner.
 
(g)           Notwithstanding any contrary provision in this Agreement, in no event may any transfer of a Unit or other Partnership Interest be made by any Limited Partner or assignee or transferee if: (i) such transfer is made to any Person who lacks the legal right, power 
 
10






 
or capacity to own such Unit or other Partnership Interest; or (ii) such transfer would require the registration of such transferred Unit or other Partnership Interest pursuant to any applicable United States federal or state securities laws (including, without limitation, the Securities Act or the Exchange Act) or other foreign securities laws or would constitute a non-exempt distribution pursuant to applicable state securities laws.
 
(h)           Spouses.
 
(i)            As a condition to becoming or remaining a Limited Partner, each Limited Partner that is an individual and is or becomes married, shall cause his or her spouse to execute an agreement in the form of Exhibit C hereof.  If an existing Limited Partner fails to have his or her spouse execute such agreement the Limited Partner shall thereafter lose all their rights hereunder except for the rights of a mere assignee and the Board of Supervisors shall thereafter have all voting rights with respect to his or her interest.
 
(ii)           Any Partnership Interest held by an individual who has failed to get his or her spouse to execute an agreement in the form of Exhibit C and any Partnership Interest held by a person who is an Assignee other than an approved Family Member (currently in compliance with all conditions of transfer to such Family Member) shall be subject to the option of the Partnership to acquire the Partnership Interest at any time, in whole not in part, for a cash payment in the amount of its fair market value as determined by the Board of Supervisors in its sole discretion.
 
(iii)          In the event of a property settlement or separation agreement between a Partner and his or her spouse, such Partner shall use his best efforts to assign to his or her spouse only the right to share in profits and losses, to receive distributions, and to receive allocations of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit or similar item to which the Partner was entitled, to the extent assigned.
 
(iv)          If a spouse or former spouse of a Partner acquires a Partnership Interest in the Partnership as a result of any such proposed settlement or separation agreement, such spouse or former spouse hereby grants, as evidenced by Exhibit C, an irrevocable power of attorney (which shall be coupled with an interest) to the original Partner who held such Partnership Interest to vote or to give or withhold such approval as such original Partner shall himself or herself vote or approve with respect to such matter and without the necessity of the taking of any action by any such spouse or former spouse.  Such power of attorney shall not be affected by the subsequent disability or incapacity of the spouse or former spouse granting such power of attorney.  Furthermore, such spouse or former spouse agrees that the Partnership shall have the option at any time to purchase all, but not less than all, of such Partnership Interest for its fair market value as determined by the Board of Supervisors in its sole discretion.
 
Section 3.5. Substituted Limited Partners.
 
(a)           Unless an Assignee becomes a Substituted Limited Partner in accordance with Section 3.5(b), such Assignee shall not be entitled to any of the rights granted to a Limited 
 
11






 
Partner hereunder, other than the right to receive allocations of income, gain, loss, deduction, credit and similar items and distributions to which the Assigning Limited Partner would otherwise be entitled, to the extent such items are Assigned.
 
(b)           An Assignee of all or part of a Partnership Interest shall become a Substituted Limited Partner entitled to all the rights of a Limited Partner (relating to the Assigned portion of the Partnership Interest), respectively, if, and only if, (i) the Assigning Limited Partner requests the Assignee be granted such right, (ii) the Board of Supervisors determines to grant such rights, (iii) the Assignee has paid any fees and reimbursed the Partnership for any expenses paid by the Partnership in connection with such transfer and assignment and (iii) the Assignee executes and delivers such instruments (including Exhibit A or Exhibit B, as applicable) in form and substance satisfactory to the Board of Supervisors, as the Board of Supervisors may deem necessary or desirable to effect such substitution.  The Partnership shall be entitled to treat the record owner of any Partnership Interest as the absolute owner thereof in all respects and shall incur no liability for distributions of cash or other property made to such owner until such time as an Assignment of such interest that complies with the terms of this Agreement has been effected.
 
Section 3.6. No Publicly Traded Partnership.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the prior consent of the Board of Supervisors, no Partner shall Dispose of all or any part of its Partnership Interest in such a manner that, after the Disposition, the Partnership would become taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
 
Section 3.7. Splits, Distributions and Reclassifications.  The Partnership shall not in any manner subdivide (by any Unit split, Unit distribution, reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) or combine (by reverse Unit split, reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) the outstanding Units unless an identical event is occurring with respect to the Common Stock, in which event the Units shall be subdivided or combined concurrently with and in the same manner as the Common Stock.
 
Section 3.8. Cancellation of Common Stock and Units.  At any time a share of Common Stock is redeemed, repurchased, acquired, cancelled or terminated by Athlon Energy, one (1) Unit registered in the name of Athlon Energy will automatically be cancelled for no consideration by the Partnership so that the aggregate number of Units held by Athlon Energy at all times equals the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding.
 
Section 3.9. Incentive Plans.  At any time Athlon Energy issues a share of Common Stock pursuant to an Incentive Plan (whether pursuant to the exercise of a stock option or the grant of a restricted share award or otherwise, provided however that the issuance of a share of Common Stock in connection with a restricted share award shall not be deemed to occur for purposes of this Section 3.9 until such share becomes vested), the following shall occur: (a) Athlon Energy shall be deemed to contribute to the capital of the Partnership an amount of cash equal to the current per share market price of a share of Common Stock on the date such share is issued (or, if earlier, the date the related award under the Incentive Plan is exercised) and the Capital Account of Athlon Energy shall be adjusted accordingly; (b) the Partnership shall be deemed to purchase from Athlon Energy a share of Common Stock for an amount of cash equal to the amount of cash deemed contributed by Athlon Energy to the Partnership in clause (a) 
 
12






 
above (and such share is deemed delivered to its owner under the Incentive Plan); (c) the net proceeds (including the amount of any payments made on a loan with respect to an Incentive Plan award) received by Athlon Energy with respect to such share, if any, shall be concurrently transferred and paid to the Partnership (and such net proceeds so transferred shall not constitute a capital contribution); and (d) the Partnership shall issue to Athlon Energy one (1) Unit registered in the name of Athlon Energy.
 
Section 3.10. Offerings of Common Stock.  At any time Athlon Energy issues a share of Common Stock other than pursuant to an Incentive Plan or an Exchange Transaction, the net proceeds or other consideration received by Athlon Energy with respect to such share, if any, shall be concurrently contributed to the Partnership and the Partnership shall issue to Athlon Energy one (1) Unit registered in the name of Athlon Energy; provided, that unless otherwise determined by the Board of Supervisors in its sole discretion, this Section 3.10 shall not apply to any shares of Common Stock issued by Athlon Energy in connection with (a) any direct or indirect business combination or acquisition transaction involving Athlon Energy, (b) any joint venture or strategic partnership entered into by Athlon Energy or (c) to financial institutions, commercial lenders, brokers/finders or any similar party, or to respective designees, in connection with the incurrence or guarantee of indebtedness by Athlon Energy or any of its subsidiaries.  In the event of an issuance of Common Stock, and the contribution of the net proceeds or other consideration from such issuance to the Partnership, the Partnership shall pay Athlon Energys expenses associated with such issuance, including any underwriting discounts or commissions (it being understood that payment of some or all of such expenses may be made by Athlon Energy on behalf of the Partnership out of the gross proceeds of such issuance prior to the contribution of such net proceeds or other consideration by Athlon Energy to the Partnership).

CAPITAL COMMITMENTS
 
Section 4.1. Capital Accounts.
 
(a)           A Capital Account shall be established and maintained for each Partner in accordance with the provisions of Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv).  Each Partner has made a capital contribution to the Partnership and owns Units in the amount and designation set forth for such Partner on Schedule A, as the same may be amended from time to time by the Board of Supervisors to the extent necessary to reflect accurately sales, exchanges, conversions or other Transfers, redemptions, capital contributions, the issuance of additional Units or similar events having an effect on a Partners ownership of Units.  Except as provided by laws or in Sections 3.10, 8.5 and 11.3, the Partners shall have no obligations or right to make any additional capital contributions or loans to the Partnership.
 
(b)           Such Capital Account shall be (i) increased by (A) the amount of money contributed by that Partner to the Partnership, (B) the fair market value as of the date of contribution (as determined by the Board of Supervisors) of property contributed by that Partner to the Partnership (net of liabilities secured by the contributed property that the Partnership is considered to assume or take subject to under Code Section 752) and (C) all items of Partnership 
 
13






 
income and gain (including, without limitation, income and gain exempt from tax) and allocated with respect to such Partnership Interest pursuant to Section 5.1, and (ii) decreased by (A) the amount of money distributed to that Partner by the Partnership, (B) the fair market value as of the date of distribution (as determined by the Board of Supervisors) of property distributed to that Partner by the Partnership (net of liabilities secured by the distributed property that the Partner is considered to assume or take subject to under Code Section 752), and (C) all items of Partnership deduction and loss and allocated with respect to such Partnership Interest pursuant to Section 5.1.  A transferee of a Partnership Interest shall succeed to a pro rata portion of the Capital Account of the transferor relating to the Partnership Interest so transferred.
 
(c)           The Book Value of Partnership property and the Capital Accounts of the Partners shall be adjusted in the following circumstances:
 
(i)            Consistent with the provisions of Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f), upon (A) an issuance of additional Partnership Interests as consideration for cash or contributed property (other than a de minimis amount) following the Effective Date, (B) the distribution by the Partnership to a Partner of more than a de minimis amount of property as consideration for a Partnership Interest following the Effective Date or (C) the issuance of additional Partnership Interests (other than a de minimis interest) as consideration for the provision of services to or for the benefit of the Partnership by an existing Partner acting in a partner capacity, or by a new Partner acting in a partner capacity or in anticipation of being a Partner, the Capital Accounts of all Partners and the Book Value of each Partnership property immediately prior to such issuance shall be adjusted upward or downward to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to such Partnership property, as if such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss had been recognized on an actual sale of each such property immediately prior to such issuance or distribution and had been allocated to the Partners at such time pursuant to Section 5.1; provided, that adjustment pursuant to clauses (A), (B) and (C) above shall be made only if the Board of Supervisors reasonably determines that such adjustments are necessary or appropriate to reflect the relative economic interests of the Partners.
 
(ii)           In accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f), immediately prior to any actual or deemed distribution to a Partner of any Partnership property following the Effective Date (other than a distribution solely of cash that is not in redemption or retirement of a Partnership Interest), the Capital Accounts of all Partners and the Book Value of such Partnership property shall be adjusted upward or downward to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to such Partnership property, as if such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss had been recognized in a sale of such property immediately prior to such distribution for an amount equal to its fair market value, and had been allocated to the Partners, at such time, pursuant to Section 5.1.
 
(d)           Capital Accounts shall be adjusted, in a manner consistent with this Section 4.1, to reflect any adjustments in items of the Partnerships income, gain, loss or deduction that result from amended returns filed by the Partnership or pursuant to an agreement by the Partnership with the Internal Revenue Service or a final court decision.

Section 4.2. Return of Contributions.  An unrepaid Capital Contribution is not a liability of the Partnership or of any other Partner.  A Partner is not required to contribute or to lend any cash or property to the Partnership to enable the Partnership to return any other Partners Capital Contributions.
 
Section 4.3. Advances by Partners.  If the Partnership does not have sufficient cash to pay its obligations, with the approval of the Board of Supervisors, the General Partner or any of the Limited Partners may (but shall have no obligation to) advance all or part of the needed funds to or on behalf of the Partnership, which advance shall constitute a loan from such Partner to the Partnership, shall bear interest at the rate determined by the Board of Supervisors in this sole discretion from the date of the advance until the date of payment, and shall not be a Capital Contribution.  Any advance made by the General Partner or any of the Limited Partners shall be repaid by the Partnership prior to any distributions under Sections 5.3.
 
ARTICLE V
 
ALLOCATIONS AND DISTRIBUTIONS
 
Section 5.1. Allocations for Capital Account Purposes.  For purposes of maintaining the Capital Accounts and in determining the rights of the Partners among themselves, the Partnerships items of income, gain, loss and deduction shall be allocated among the Partners in each taxable year (or portion thereof) as provided hereinbelow.
 
(a)           Net Income and Net Loss.  After giving effect to the special allocations set forth in Section 5.1(b), Net Income and Net Loss for each taxable period (and all items of income, gain, loss and deduction taken into account in computing Net Income or Net Loss for such taxable period) shall be allocated to the Partners as follows:
 
(i)            Net Income for each taxable period shall be allocated as follows:
 
(A)          First, to the General Partner until the aggregate Net Income allocated to the General Partner pursuant to this Section 5.1(a)(i)(A) for the current and each prior taxable year is equal to the Net Loss allocated to the General Partner pursuant to Section 5.1(a)(ii)(B) during all prior periods; and
 
(B)          Second, to the Partners in accordance with their Percentage Interests.
 
(ii)           Net Loss for each taxable period shall be allocated as follows:
 
(A)          First, to the Partners in accordance with their Percentage Interests until the Adjusted Capital Account of each Partner is reduced to zero; and
 
(B)          Second, 100% to the General Partner.
 
(b)           Special Allocations.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 5.1, the following special allocations shall be made for such taxable period:
 
15







 
(i)            Partnership Minimum Gain Chargeback.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 5.1, if there is a net decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain during any Partnership taxable period, each Partner shall be allocated items of Partnership income and gain for such period (and, if necessary, subsequent periods) in the manner and amounts provided in Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-2(f)(6), 1.704-2(g)(2) and 1.704-2(j)(2)(i).  For purposes of this Section 5.1(b), each Partners Adjusted Capital Account balance shall be determined, and the allocation of income or gain required hereunder shall be effected, prior to the application of any other allocations pursuant to this Section 5.1(b) with respect to such taxable period (other than allocations pursuant to Sections 5.1(b)(v) and 5.1(b)(vi)).  This Section 5.1(b)(i) is intended to comply with the partnership minimum gain chargeback requirement in Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(f) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith
 
(ii)           Chargeback of Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain.  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 5.1 (other than Section 5.1(b)(i)), except as provided in Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(4), if there is a net decrease in Partner Minimum Gain during any Partnership taxable period, any Partner with a share of such Partner Minimum Gain at the beginning of such taxable period shall be allocated items of Partnership income and gain for such period (and, if necessary, subsequent periods) in the manner and amounts provided in Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-2(i)(4) and 1.704-2(j)(2)(ii).  For purposes of this Section 5.1(b), each Partners Adjusted Capital Account balance shall be determined, and the allocation of income or gain required hereunder shall be effected, prior to the application of any other allocations pursuant to this Section 5.1(b), other than Sections 5.1(b)(i), 5.1(b)(v) and 5.1(b)(vi), with respect to such taxable period.  This Section 5.1(b)(ii) is intended to comply with the chargeback of items of income and gain requirement in Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(4) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.
 
(iii)          Qualified Income Offset.  In the event any Partner unexpectedly receives any adjustments, allocations or distributions described in Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(5), or 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(6), items of Partnership income and gain shall be specially allocated to such Partner in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate, to the extent required by the Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 704(b) of the Code, the deficit balance, if any, in its Adjusted Capital Account created by such adjustments, allocations or distributions as quickly as possible unless such deficit balance is otherwise eliminated pursuant to Sections 5.1(b)(i) or (ii); provided that an allocation pursuant to this Section 5.1(b)(iii) shall be made only if and to the extent that such Partner would have a deficit balance in its Adjusted Capital Account after all other allocations provided for in this Section 5.1 have been tentatively made as if this Section 5.1(b)(iii) were not in this Agreement.
 
(iv)          Gross Income Allocations.  In the event any Partner has a deficit balance in its Adjusted Capital Account (determined without regard to Subdivision (ii) of the definition of Adjusted Capital Account) at the end of any Partnership taxable period, such Partner shall be specially allocated items of Partnership gross income and gain in the amount of such excess as quickly as possible; provided, that an allocation pursuant to this Section 5.1(b)(iv) shall be made only if and to the extent that such Partner would have a
 
16






 
deficit balance in its Adjusted Capital Account (as so determined) after all other allocations provided for in this Section 5.1 have been tentatively made as if this Section 5.1(b)(iv) and Section 5.1(b)(iii) were not in this Agreement.
 
(v)           Partnership Nonrecourse Deductions.  Partnership Nonrecourse Deductions for any taxable period shall be allocated to the Partners in accordance with their respective Percentage Interests.
 
(vi)          Partner Nonrecourse Deductions.  Partner Nonrecourse Deductions for any taxable period shall be allocated 100% to the Partner that bears the Economic Risk of Loss with respect to the Partner Nonrecourse Debt to which such Partner Nonrecourse Deductions are attributable in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(i).  If more than one Partner bears the Economic Risk of Loss with respect to a Partner Nonrecourse Debt, such Partner Nonrecourse Deductions attributable thereto shall be allocated between or among such Partners in accordance with the ratios in which they share such Economic Risk of Loss.
 
(vii)         Partnership Nonrecourse Liabilities.  For purposes of Treasury Regulations Section 1.752-3(a)(3), Partnership Nonrecourse Liabilities shall be allocated among the Partners in accordance with their respective Percentage Interests.
 
(viii)        Limitations on Deductions.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) above, no allocation of Net Loss or item of loss or deduction (other than an allocation of Partner Nonrecourse Deductions or Partnership Nonrecourse Deductions) shall be made to a Limited Partner to the extent such allocation would cause or increase a deficit balance in such Partners capital account.  Such loss or deduction instead shall be allocated to the General Partner.  For purposes of this paragraph the capital accounts of the Partners shall be reduced for any adjustment, allocation or distribution described in Treas. Reg. § 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5) or (6).
 
(ix)          Curative Allocation
 
(A)          The Required Allocations shall be taken into account in making the Agreed Allocations so that, to the extent possible, the net amount of items of income, gain, loss and deduction allocated to each Partner pursuant to the Required Allocations and the Agreed Allocations, together, shall be equal to the net amount of such items that would have been allocated to each such Partner under the Agreed Allocations had the Required Allocations and the related Curative Allocation not otherwise been provided in this Section 5.1.  Allocations pursuant to this Section 5.1(b)(ix)(A) shall only be made with respect to Required Allocations to the extent the Board of Supervisors reasonably determines that such allocations will otherwise be inconsistent with the economic agreement among the Partners.
 
(B)          The Board of Supervisors shall have reasonable discretion, with respect to each taxable period, to (1) apply the provisions of Section 5.1(b)(ix)(A) in whatever order is most likely to minimize the economic
 
17






 
distortions that might otherwise result from the Required Allocations and (2) divide all allocations pursuant to Section 5.1(b)(ix)(A) among the Partners in a manner that is likely to minimize such economic distortions.
 
(x)           Code Section 754 Adjustments.  To the extent an adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any Partnership asset pursuant to Section 734(b) or 743(b) of the Code is required, pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into account in determining Capital Accounts, the amount of such adjustment to the Capital Accounts shall be treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment increases the basis of the asset), or loss (if the adjustment decreases such basis), and such item of gain or loss shall be specially allocated to the Partners in a manner consistent with the manner in which their Capital Accounts are required to be adjusted pursuant to such Section of the Treasury Regulations.
 
(c)           Simulated Depletion with respect to each separate oil and gas property shall be allocated to the Partners in the same proportion that the Partners (or their predecessors in interest) were allocated the adjusted tax basis of such property under Section 5.2(b).
 
(d)           Special Rules.  It is intended that (i) the Capital Accounts be maintained at all times in accordance with Section 704 of the Code and applicable Regulations, (ii) the Capital Accounts shall be increased or decreased by any items required by the Regulations under section 704(b) of the Code to increase or decrease, respectively, a Partners Capital Account, and (iii) the provisions hereof relating to the Capital Accounts be interpreted in a manner consistent therewith.  The Board of Supervisors shall be authorized to make appropriate amendments to the allocations of items pursuant to this Section 5.1 if necessary in order to comply with Section 704 of the Code or applicable Regulations thereunder or to effect the terms, purposes and conditions of this Agreement; provided, however, that no such change shall have a material adverse effect upon the amount distributable to any Partner hereunder.
 
Section 5.2. Allocations for Tax Purposes.
 
(a)           Except as otherwise provided herein, for federal income tax purposes, (i) each item of income, gain, loss and deduction shall be allocated among the Partners in the same manner as its correlative item of book income, gain, loss or deduction is allocated pursuant to Section 5.1, and (ii) each tax credit shall be allocated to the Partners in the same manner as the receipt or expenditure giving rise to such credit is allocated pursuant to Section 5.1.
 
(b)           The deduction for depletion with respect to each separate oil and gas property (as defined in Section 614 of the Code) shall, in accordance with Section 613A(c)(7)(D) of the Code, be computed for federal income tax purposes separately by the Partners rather than the Partnership.  Except as provided in Section 5.2(d), for purposes of such computation, the proportionate share of the adjusted tax basis of each oil and gas property shall be allocated among the Partners in accordance with their Percentage Interests.  Each Partner, with the assistance of the Board of Supervisors, shall separately keep records of its share of the adjusted tax basis in each separate oil and gas property, adjust such share of the adjusted tax basis for any cost or percentage depletion allowable with respect to such property and use such adjusted tax basis in the computation of its cost depletion or in the computation of its gain or loss on the
 
18






 
disposition of such property by the Partnership.  Upon the request of the Board of Supervisors, each Limited Partner shall advise the Board of Supervisors of its adjusted tax basis in each separate oil and gas property and any depletion computed with respect thereto, both as computed in accordance with the provisions of this subsection.  The Board of Supervisors may rely on such information and, if it is not provided by the Limited Partner, may make such reasonable assumptions as it shall determine with respect thereto.
 
(c)           Except as provided in Section 5.2(d), for the purposes of the separate computation of gain or loss by each Partner on the sale or disposition of each separate oil and gas property (as defined in Section 614 of the Code), the Partnerships allocable share of the amount realized (as such term is defined in Section 1001(b) of the Code) from such sale or disposition shall be allocated for federal income tax purposes among the Partners as follows:
 
(i)            first, to the extent such amount realized constitutes a recovery of the Simulated Basis of the property, to the Partners in the same percentages as the depletable basis of such property was allocated to the Partners pursuant to Section 5.2(b);
 
(ii)           second, the remainder of such amount realized, if any, to the Partners so that, to the maximum extent possible, the total amount realized allocated to each Partner under this Section 5.2(c) will equal such Partners share of the proceeds derived by the Partnership from such sale or disposition.
 
(d)           In accordance with Section 704(c) of the Code and the applicable Treasury Regulations thereunder, income, gain, loss, and deduction with respect to any property contributed to the Partnership shall, solely for tax purposes, be allocated among the Partners so as to take account of any variation between the adjusted basis of such property to the Partnership for federal income tax purposes and its initial Book Value.  In the event the Book Value of any property is adjusted pursuant to Section 4.1(c), subsequent allocations of income, gain, loss, and deduction with respect to such property shall take account of any variation between the adjusted basis of such property for federal income tax purposes and its Book Value in the same manner as under Code Section 704(c) and the applicable Regulations thereunder.  For purposes of this applying this Section 5.2(d), the Board of Supervisors shall apply any reasonable method under Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-3.
 
(e)           Any gain allocated to the Partners upon the sale or other taxable disposition of any Partnership asset shall, to the extent possible, after taking into account other required allocations of gain pursuant to this Section 5.2, be characterized as Recapture Income in the same proportions and to the same extent as such Partners (or their predecessors in interest) have been allocated any deductions directly or indirectly giving rise to the treatment of such gains as Recapture Income.
 
(f)            All items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit recognized by the Partnership for federal income tax purposes and allocated to the Partners in accordance with the provisions hereof shall be determined without regard to any election under Section 754 of the Code which may be made by the Partnership; provided, however, that such allocations, once made, shall be adjusted as necessary or appropriate to take into account those adjustments permitted or required by Sections 734 and 743 of the Code.

MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONS OF THE PARTNERSHIP
 
Section 6.1. Management Generally.  In order to enable the Board of Supervisors to manage the business and affairs of the Partnership, the General Partner hereby irrevocably delegates to the Board of Supervisors all management powers over the business and affairs of the Partnership that it may now or hereafter possess under applicable law (other than its obligations as tax matters partner under Section 8.3 of this Agreement) as permitted under Section 17-403(c) of the Act.  The General Partner further agrees to take any and all action necessary and appropriate, in the sole discretion of the Board of Supervisors, to effect any duly authorized actions by the Board of Supervisors or any Officer, including executing or filing any agreements, instruments or certificates, delivering all documents, providing all information and taking or refraining from taking action as may be necessary or appropriate to achieve all the effective delegation of power described in this Section.  Each of the Partners and Assignees and each Person who may acquire an interest in a Partnership Interest hereby approves, consents to, ratifies and confirms such delegation.  The delegation by the General Partner to the Board of Supervisors of management powers over the business and affairs of the Partnership pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement shall not cause the General Partner to cease to be a general partner of the Partnership nor shall it cause the Board of Supervisors or any member thereof to be a general partner of the Partnership or to have or be subject to the liabilities of a general partner of the Partnership.  Except as provided in Section 8.3 of this Agreement relating to the General Partners duties as tax matters partner and except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the management of the Partnership shall be vested exclusively in the Board of Supervisors and, subject to the direction of the Board of Supervisors, the Officers.  Neither the General Partner nor any of the Limited Partners in their capacities as such shall have any part in the management of the Partnership (except, with respect to the General Partner, as provided in Section 8.3 of this Agreement relating to its duties as tax matters partner) and shall have no authority or right to act on behalf of the Partnership or deal with any third parties on behalf of the Partnership in connection with any matter, except as requested or authorized by the Board of Supervisors.

(b)           Voting; Quorum.  Each member of the Board of Supervisors shall have one vote.  Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, the vote of the majority of the members of the Board of Supervisors present at a meeting in which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board of Supervisors.  A majority of the number of members of the Board of Supervisors then in office shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the Board of Supervisors, but if less than a quorum is present at a meeting, a majority of the members of the Board of Supervisors present at such meeting may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present.

(b)           Authority.  Officers shall have the powers and duties defined in the resolutions appointing them including, to the extent so provided, the authority to exercise the power of the Board of Supervisors in the management of the Partnership.
 
21

22






 
(b)           Whenever this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby provides that the Board of Supervisors is permitted or required to make a decision (i) in its sole discretion or discretion, that it deems necessary or appropriate or under a grant of similar authority or latitude, the Board of Supervisors shall be entitled to consider only such interests and factors as it desires and shall have no duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of, or factors affecting, the Partnership, any Partner or any Assignee, (ii) it will make such decision in good faith unless another express standard is provided for, or (iii) in good faith or under another express standard, the Board of Supervisors shall act under such express standard and shall not be subject to any other or different standards imposed by this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby or under the Act or any other law, rule or regulation.
 
(c)           Whenever a particular transaction, arrangement or resolution of a conflict of interest is required under this Agreement to be fair and reasonable to any Person, the fair and reasonable nature of such transaction, arrangement or resolution shall be considered in the context of all similar or related transactions.

Section 6.7. Other Matters Concerning the Board of Supervisors.
 
(a)           The Board of Supervisors may rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, bond, debenture, or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties.
 
(b)           The Board of Supervisors may consult with legal counsel, accountants, appraisers, management consultants, investment bankers and other consultants and advisers selected by it, and any act taken or omitted to be taken in reliance upon the opinion (including, without limitation, an opinion of counsel) of such Persons as to matters that such Board of Supervisors reasonably believes to be within such Persons professional or expert competence shall be conclusively presumed to have been done or omitted in good faith and in accordance with such opinion.
 
(c)           Any standard of care and any duty imposed by this Agreement or stated or implied by law or equity shall be modified, waived or limited as required to permit the Board of Supervisors to act under this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated by this Agreement and to make any decision pursuant to the authority prescribed in this Agreement so long as such action is reasonably believed by the Board of Supervisors to be in, or not inconsistent with, the best interests of the Partnership.
 
Section 6.8. Reliance by Third Parties.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Persons dealing with the Partnership are entitled to rely conclusively upon the power and authority of the Board of Supervisors.  Any Officer of the Partnership authorized by the Board of Supervisors to act on behalf and in the name of the Partnership with respect to the relevant matter shall have full power and authority to encumber, sell or otherwise use in any

(a)           any certificates or other instruments or amendments thereof which the Partnership may be required to file under the Act or any other laws of the State of Delaware or pursuant to the requirements of any governmental authority having jurisdiction over the Partnership or which the Board of Supervisors shall deem it advisable to file, including, without limitation, this Agreement, any amended Agreement or certificate of cancellation;

24






 
performance of its duties as tax matters partner). The General Partner shall be entitled to reimbursement of all of its expenses attributable to the performance of its obligations hereunder.

RIGHTS OF PARTNERS
 
Section 7.1. Access to Information.  In addition to the other rights specifically set forth in this Agreement, each Limited Partner shall have access to all information to which a Partner is entitled to have access pursuant to Section 17-305(a) of the Act.
 
Section 7.2. Reserved.
 
Section 7.3. Confidentiality.  The Partnership agrees to provide the Partners valuable confidential and proprietary information of the Partnership, of other Partners and their Affiliates and of third parties who have supplied such information to the Partnership.  In consideration of such confidential information and other valuable consideration provided hereunder, each of the Partners agrees to abide by this Section 7.3.  Unless the Board of Supervisors agrees otherwise, each Partner shall hold in strict confidence any information such Partner receives regarding the Partnership, the General Partner, any other Partner, or their respective Affiliates, whether such information is received from the Partnership, its Affiliates, the other Partners or their respective Affiliates or another Person; provided, however, that such restrictions shall not apply to (a) information that is or becomes available to the public generally without breach of this Section 7.3; (b) disclosures required to be made by applicable laws and regulations or stock exchange requirements or requirements of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority; (c) disclosures required to be made pursuant to an order, subpoena or other legal process; (d) disclosures to officers, directors or Affiliates of such Partner (and the officers and directors of such Affiliates), to auditors, counsel, and other professional advisors to or potential financing sources of such Persons or the Partnership and to Persons who are direct or indirect beneficial owners of interests in the Partnership and their representatives (provided, however, that such Persons have been informed of the confidential nature of the information, and, in any event, the Partner disclosing such information shall be liable for any failure by such Persons to abide by the provisions of this Section 7.3); (e) disclosures in connection with any litigation or dispute among the Partners and/or the Partnership; or (f) disclosures made by a Partner acting in accordance with the provision regarding confidentiality of certain information of an applicable employment agreement that is then in effect; provided further that any disclosure pursuant to clause (b), (c), (d), (e) or (f) of this sentence shall be made only subject to such procedures as the Partner making such disclosure determines in good faith are reasonable and appropriate in the circumstances, taking into account the need to maintain the confidentiality of such information and the availability, if any, of procedures under laws, regulations, orders, subpoenas, or other legal processes.  Each Partner shall notify the General Partner immediately upon becoming aware of any order, subpoena, or other legal process providing for the disclosure or production of information subject to the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence and, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law, immediately shall supply the General Partner with a copy of
 
25






 
any such order, subpoena, or other legal process.  In addition, each Partner shall notify the General Partner prior to disclosing or producing any information subject to the provisions of the two immediately preceding sentences and, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law, shall permit the General Partner to seek a protective order protecting the confidentiality of such information.  The obligations of a Partner pursuant to this Section 7.3 shall continue following the time such Person ceases to be a Partner, but thereafter such Person shall not have the right to enforce the provisions of this Agreement.  Each Partner acknowledges that disclosure of information in violation of the provisions of this Section 7.3 may cause irreparable injury to the Partnership and the Partners for which monetary damages are inadequate, difficult to compute, or both.  Accordingly, each Partner agrees that its obligations under this Section 7.3 may be enforced by specific performance and that breaches or prospective breaches of this Section 7.3 may be enjoined.
 
Section 7.4. Liability to Third Parties.  No Limited Partner or member of the Board of Supervisors shall have any personal liability for any obligations or liabilities of the Partnership, whether such obligations or liabilities arise in contract, tort or otherwise, except to the extent that any such obligations or liabilities are expressly assumed in writing by such Limited Partner or member of the Board of Supervisors and except as otherwise provided in this Agreement.  Any action taken by any member of the Board of Supervisors who is also a Limited Partner shall not be deemed to be participation in the control of the business of the Partnership by a limited partner of the Partnership within the meaning of Section 17-303(a) of the Act and shall not affect, impair or eliminate the limitations on the liability of Limited Partners or Assignees under this Agreement.
 
ARTICLE VIII
 
TAXES
 
Section 8.1. Tax Returns.  The Board of Supervisors shall cause to be prepared and filed all necessary federal and state income tax returns for the Partnership, including making the elections described in Section 8.2.  Each other Partner shall furnish to the Board of Supervisors all pertinent information in its possession relating to Partnership operations that is necessary to enable the Partnerships income tax returns to be prepared and filed.  The Board of Supervisors shall prepare all federal and state tax returns on a timely basis.  The Board of Supervisors shall furnish to each Partner copies of all returns that are actually filed promptly after their filing.
 
Section 8.2. Tax Elections.  The Partnership shall make the following elections on the appropriate tax returns:
 
(a)           to adopt the calendar year as the Partnerships fiscal year, unless otherwise required by the Code;
 
(b)           to adopt the cash or accrual method of accounting, as determined by the Board of Supervisors, and to keep the Partnerships books and records on the income-tax method;
 
26







 
(c)           if a distribution of Partnership property as described in Section 734 of the Code occurs or if a transfer of a Partnership Interest as described in Section 743 of the Code occurs, on request by notice from the Limited Partners, to elect, pursuant to Section 754 of the Code, to adjust the basis of Partnership properties;
 
(d)           to elect to amortize the start-up expenses of the Partnership ratably over a period of 180 months as permitted by Section 709(b) of the Code; and
 
(e)           any other election the Board of Supervisors may deem appropriate and in the best interests of the Partners.
 
It is the intent of the Partners that the Partnership be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, for state and local franchise and income tax purposes.  Neither the Partnership nor any Partner may make an election for the Partnership to be excluded from the application of the provisions of subchapter K of chapter 1 of subtitle A of the Code or any similar provisions of applicable state or local law, and no provision of this Agreement shall be construed to sanction or approve such an election.
 
Section 8.3. Tax Matters Partner.  The General Partner shall be the tax matters partner of the Partnership pursuant to Section 6231(a)(7) of the Code.  The tax matters partner shall take such action as may be necessary to cause each other Partner to become a notice partner within the meaning of Section 6231(a)(8) of the Code.  The tax matters partner may not take any action contemplated by Sections 6222 through 6231 of the Code without the consent of the Limited Partners representing a majority of the Percentage Interests, but this sentence does not authorize the tax matters partner to take any action left to the determination of an individual Limited Partner under Sections 6222 through 6231 of the Code; provided, however, that the tax matters partner shall not consent to an extension of the statute of limitations for a Partnership taxable year without the consent of the Board of Supervisors.
 
Section 8.4. Tax Matters.  In exercising their discretion pursuant to this Article VIII or otherwise in regard to matters pertaining to taxes, the Partnership (through the Board of Supervisors) and the General Partner shall fairly take into account the interests of all Partners, and shall not be obligated to take into account the specific interests or circumstances of any particular partner or group of partners.
 
Section 8.5. Withholding Taxes.
 
(a)           Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, (i) each Partner hereby authorizes the Partnership to withhold and to pay over, or otherwise pay, any withholding or other taxes payable by the Partnership or any of its Affiliates with respect to such Partner or as a result of such Partners participation in the Partnership and (ii) if and to the extent that the Partnership shall be required to withhold or pay any such taxes (including any amounts withheld from amounts payable to the Partnership to the extent attributable, in the judgment of the Board of Supervisors, to the interest of such Partner in the Partnership), such Partner shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement to have received a payment from the Partnership as of the time such withholding or tax is required to be paid, which payment shall be deemed to be a distribution with respect to such Partners interest in the Partnership.  To the extent that the
 
27






 
aggregate of such payments to a Partner for any period exceeds the distributions to which such Partner is entitled for such period, such Partner shall make a prompt payment to the Partnership of such amount.
 
(b)           If the Partnership makes a distribution in kind and such distribution is subject to withholding or other taxes payable by the Partnership on behalf of any Partner, such Partner shall make a prompt payment to the Partnership of the amount of such withholding or other taxes by wire transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon dissolution pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section 11.1, Limited Partners representing a majority of the Percentage Interests may elect to continue the business of the Partnership by adopting a resolution to that effect within 90 days of the occurrence of the event causing such dissolution, and, if necessary, appoint a new general partner of the Partnership.
 
28






 
Section 11.2. Merger or Sale of All of the Assets.  A merger or sale of all of the assets of the Partnership must be approved by the Board of Supervisors.
 
Section 11.3. Liquidation and Termination.  On dissolution of the Partnership, the Board of Supervisors shall act as liquidator or may appoint one or more other Persons as liquidator(s).  The liquidator shall proceed diligently to wind up the affairs of the Partnership and make final distributions as provided herein.  The costs of liquidation shall be borne as a Partnership expense.  Until final distribution, the liquidator shall continue to operate the Partnership properties with all of the power and authority of the Board of Supervisors.  The steps to be accomplished by the liquidator are as follows:
 
(a)           as promptly as possible after dissolution and again after final liquidation, the liquidator shall cause a proper accounting to be made by a recognized firm of certified public accountants of the Partnerships assets, liabilities, and operations through the last day of the calendar month in which the dissolution occurs or the final liquidation is completed, as applicable;
 
(b)           the liquidator shall pay from Partnership funds all of the debts and liabilities of the Partnership (including, without limitation, all expenses incurred in liquidation and any advances described in Section 4.3) or otherwise make adequate provision therefor (including, without limitation, the establishment of a cash escrow fund for contingent liabilities in such amount and for such term as the liquidator may reasonably determine); and
 
(c)           all remaining assets of the Partnership shall be distributed to the Partners as follows:
 
(i)            the liquidator may sell any or all Partnership property, including to Partners, and any resulting gain or loss from each sale shall be computed and allocated to the Capital Accounts;
 
(ii)           with respect to all Partnership property that has not been sold, the fair market value of that property shall be determined and the Capital Accounts shall be adjusted to reflect the manner in which the unrealized income, gain, loss, and deduction inherent in property that has not been reflected in the Capital Accounts previously would be allocated among the Partners if there were a taxable disposition of that property for the fair market value of that property on the date of distribution; and
 
(iii)          All remaining assets shall be distributed to the Partners in accordance with Section 5.3.  If such distributions do not correspond to the positive capital account balances of the Partners immediately prior to such distributions, then income, gain, loss and deduction for the fiscal year in which the liquidation occurs shall be reallocated among the Partners to cause, to the extent possible, the Partners positive capital account balances immediately prior to such distribution to correspond to such amounts, and in the event the income, gain, loss and deduction for the fiscal year in which the liquidation occurs is not sufficient to achieve this result then the income, gain, loss and deduction for prior fiscal years shall be reallocated to achieve such result and the
 
29






 
income tax returns of the Partnership which may be amended for this purpose shall be amended and filed as appropriate.
 
All distributions in kind to the Partners shall be made subject to the liability of each distributee for its allocable share of costs, expenses, and liabilities theretofore incurred or for which the Partnership has committed prior to the date of termination and those costs, expenses, and liabilities shall be allocated to the distributee pursuant to this Section 11.3.  The distribution of cash and/or property to a Partner in accordance with the provisions of this Section 11.3 constitutes a complete return to the Partner of its Capital Contributions and a complete distribution to the Partner of its Partnership Interest and all the Partnerships property.
 
Section 11.4. Cancellation of Filing.  On completion of the distribution of Partnership assets as provided herein, the Partnership is terminated, and the Partners (or such other Person or Persons as may be required) shall cause the cancellation of any other filings made as provided in Section 2.6 and shall take such other actions as may be necessary to terminate the Partnership.
 
ARTICLE XII
 
GENERAL PROVISIONS
 
Section 12.1. Offset.  Whenever the Partnership is to pay any sum to any Partner in such Persons capacity as a Partner, any amounts such Partner owes the Partnership in such Persons capacity as a Partner may be deducted from that sum before payment.
 
Section 12.2.

Section 12.4. Effect of Waiver or Consent.  A waiver or consent, express or implied, to or of any breach or default by any Person in the performance by that Person of its obligations with respect to the Partnership is not a consent or waiver to or of any other breach or default in the performance by that Person of the same or any other obligations of that Person with respect to the Partnership.  Failure on the part of a Person to complain of any act of any Person or to declare any Person in default with respect to the Partnership, irrespective of how long that failure continues, does not constitute a waiver by that Person of its rights with respect to that default until the applicable limitations period has expired.
