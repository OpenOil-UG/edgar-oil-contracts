APPENDIX 3
 
Anti-Corruption Guideline for IFC Transactions
 
The purpose of these Guidelines is to clarify the meaning of the terms Corrupt Practices, Fraudulent Practices, Coercive Practices, Collusive Practices and Obstructive Practices in the context of IFC operations.
 
1.            CORRUPT PRACTICES
 
1.1          Definition
 
A Corrupt Practice is the offering, giving, receiving or soliciting, directly or indirectly, of anything of value to influence improperly the actions of another party.
 
1.2          Interpretation
 
(A)          Corrupt practices are understood as kickbacks and bribery.  The conduct in question must involve the use of improper means (such as bribery) to violate or derogate a duty owed by the recipient in order for the payor to obtain an undue advantage or to avoid an obligation.  Antitrust, securities and other violations of law that are not of this nature are excluded from the definition of corrupt practices.
 
(B)          It is acknowledged that foreign investment agreements, concessions and other types of contracts commonly require investors to make contributions for bona fide social development purposes or to provide funding for infrastructure unrelated to the project. Similarly, investors are often required or expected to make contributions to bona fide local charities. These practices are not viewed as Corrupt Practices for purposes of these definitions, so long as they are permitted under local law and fully disclosed in the payors books and records. Similarly, an investor will not be held liable for corrupt or fraudulent practices committed by entities that administer bona fide social development funds or charitable contributions.
 
(C)          In the context of conduct between private parties, the offering, giving, receiving or soliciting of corporate hospitality and gifts that are customary by internationally-accepted industry standards shall not constitute corrupt practices unless the action violates applicable law.
 
(D)          Payment by private sector persons of the reasonable travel and entertainment expenses of public officials that are consistent with existing practice under relevant law and international conventions will not be viewed as Corrupt Practices.
 
(E)          The World Bank Group does not condone facilitation payments.  For the purposes of implementation, the interpretation of Corrupt Practices relating to facilitation payments will take into account relevant law and international conventions pertaining to corruption.
 
44






 
2.            FRAUDULENT PRACTICES
 
2.1          Definition
 
A Fraudulent Practice is any action or omission, including misrepresentation, that knowingly or recklessly misleads, or attempts to mislead, a party to obtain a financial benefit or to avoid an obligation.
 
2.2          Interpretation
 
(A)          An action, omission, or misrepresentation will be regarded as made recklessly if it is made with reckless indifference as to whether it is true or false.  Mere inaccuracy in such information, committed through simple negligence, is not enough to constitute a Fraudulent Practice for purposes of this Schedule.
 
(B)          Fraudulent Practices are intended to cover actions or omissions that are directed to or against a World Bank Group entity.  It also covers Fraudulent Practices directed to or against a World Bank Group member country in connection with the award or implementation of a government contract or concession in a project financed by the World Bank Group.  Frauds on other third parties are not condoned but are not specifically sanctioned in IFC, MIGA, or PRG operations.  Similarly, other illegal behavior is not condoned, but will not be considered as a Fraudulent Practice for purposes of this Agreement.
 
3.            COERCIVE PRACTICES
 
3.1          Definition
 
A Coercive Practice is impairing or harming, or threatening to impair or harm, directly or indirectly, any party or the property of the party to influence improperly the actions of a party.
 
3.2          Interpretation
 
(A)          Coercive Practices are actions undertaken for the purpose of bid rigging or in connection with public procurement or government contracting or in furtherance of a Corrupt Practice or a Fraudulent Practice.
 
(B)          Coercive Practices are threatened or actual illegal actions such as personal injury or abduction, damage to property, or injury to legally recognizable interests, in order to obtain an undue advantage or to avoid an obligation. It is not intended to cover hard bargaining, the exercise of legal or contractual remedies or litigation.
 
45







 
4.            COLLUSIVE PRACTICES
 
4.1          Definition
 
A Collusive Practice is an arrangement between two or more parties designed to achieve an improper purpose, including to influence improperly the actions of another party.
 
4.2          Interpretation
 
Collusive Practices are actions undertaken for the purpose of bid rigging or in connection with public procurement or government contracting or in furtherance of a Corrupt Practice or a Fraudulent Practice.
 
5.            OBSTRUCTIVE PRACTICES
 
5.1          Definition
 
An Obstructive Practice is (i) deliberately destroying, falsifying, altering or concealing of evidence material to the investigation or making of false statements to investigators, in order to materially impede a World Bank Group investigation into allegations of a corrupt, fraudulent, coercive or collusive practice, and/or threatening, harassing or intimidating any party to prevent it from disclosing its knowledge of matters relevant to the investigation or from pursuing the investigation, or (ii) acts intended to materially impede the exercise of IFCs access to contractually required information in connection with a World Bank Group investigation into allegations of a corrupt, fraudulent, coercive or collusive practice.
 
5.2          Interpretation
 
Any action legally or otherwise properly taken by a party to maintain or preserve its regulatory, legal or constitutional rights such as the attorney-client privilege, regardless of whether such action had the effect of impeding an investigation, does not constitute an Obstructive Practice.
 
6.            GENERAL INTERPRETATION
 
A person should not be liable for actions taken by unrelated third parties unless the first party participated in the prohibited act in question.

IFC Project Number: 31179
 
REPORTING PERIOD: (month/year) through (month/year)
 
AMR COMPLETION DATE: (day/month/year)
 

 
Environment and Social Development Department 2121 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20433 USA www.ifc.org/sustainability
 






 
INTRODUCTION
 
The Annual Monitoring Report
 
This section monitors the Environmental and Social performance of the Project.  IFCs Investment Agreement requires Kosmos Energy (Kosmos or the Company) to prepare a comprehensive Annual Monitoring Report (AMR) for its activities in Ghana as defined in the Loan Agreement.
 
This document comprises IFCs preferred format for environmental and social performance reporting.  The AMR informs the Environment and Social Development Department about the environmental and social state of the investment.
 
With respect to the Jubilee Field and because Kosmos is not the Projects Unit Operator, Kosmos may elect to coordinate with the Unit Operator, who has a similar obligation to IFC under their IFC Facility Agreement, and agree to submit a joint AMR for the Project.  To the extent that there are Kosmos-specific information which are covered by the social and environmental covenants of the IFC Facility Agreements but are not dealt with in the Unit Operators AMR, Kosmos will provide such information in this AMR.  Such information will include the environmental, health and safety and social performance of Kosmos staff and contractors; the environmental, health and safety and social programs specifically undertaken by Kosmos and applicable to the Project but not the responsibility of the Unit Operator; and Kosmoss activities outside the Jubilee Field.  If the Unit Operators IFC Facility Agreement is or becomes inactive, Kosmos will continue to submit an AMR also covering the Jubilee project as part of the reporting covenants of its IFC Facility Agreements as long as there remain amounts outstanding under the IFC Facilities, provided, however, that Kosmos shall only be under a Reasonable Endeavors obligation, as defined in the Facility Agreement to obtain the information to complete the AMR.  Unless otherwise indicated, the data provided in this AMR is assumed to be for Kosmoss activities exclusive of Jubilee Field, and the word Project should be read accordingly throughout.
 
Preparation Instructions
 
The following points should assist you in completing this form.  Please be descriptive in your responses and attach additional information as needed.
 
·                 IFCs Investment Agreement requires designated Kosmos personnel to complete and submit annual environmental and social monitoring reports in compliance with the schedule stipulated in the Investment agreement.
·                 Kosmos must report qualitative and quantitative project performance data each year of the investment for the environmental and social monitoring parameters included in this report format.
·                  The main purpose of completing this form is to provide the following information:
1.              Environmental and Social Management
2.              Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Performance
3.              Significant Environmental and Social Events
4.              General Information and Feedback
5.              Compliance with IFC and local environmental requirements as specified in the Investment Agreement
6.              Compliance with IFC and local social requirements as specified in the Investment Agreement
