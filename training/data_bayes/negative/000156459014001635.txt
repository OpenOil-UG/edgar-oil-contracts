 “Alternate Base Rate” means, for any day, a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate in effect on such day, (b) the Federal Funds Effective Rate in effect on such day plus one-half of one percent (½ of 1%) and (c) the Adjusted LIBO Rate for a one month Interest Period on such day (or if such day is not a Business Day, the immediately preceding Business Day) plus 1%, provided that, with respect to the determination of the Alternate Base Rate, the Adjusted LIBO Rate for any day shall be based on the rate appearing on the Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page (or on any successor or substitute page) at approximately 11:00 a.m. London time on such day (without any rounding).  Any change in the Alternate Base Rate due to a change in the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Effective Rate or the Adjusted LIBO Rate shall be effective from and including the effective date of such change in the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Effective Rate or the Adjusted LIBO Rate, respectively. If the Alternate Base Rate is being used as an alternate rate of interest pursuant to Section 2.15 hereof, then the Alternate Base Rate shall be the greater of clause (a) and (b) above and shall be determined without reference to clause (c) above.“Business Day” means any day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or other day on which commercial banks in Chicago, Illinois or Dallas, Texas are authorized or required by law to remain closed; provided that, when used in connection with a Eurodollar Loan, the term “Business Day” shall also exclude any day on which banks are not open for dealings in dollar deposits in the London interbank market.“LIBO Rate” means, with respect to any Eurodollar Borrowing for any applicable Interest Period, the London interbank offered rate administered by the ICE Benchmark Administration (or any other Person that takes over the administration of such rate for Dollars) for a period equal in length to such Interest Period as displayed on pages LIBOR01 or LIBOR02 of the Reuters screen or, in the event such rate does not appear on such Reuters page or the Reuters screen, (i) on any successor or substitute page on the Reuters screen that displays such rate, or (ii) on the appropriate page of such other information service that publishes such rate as shall be selected by the Administrative Agent from time to time in its reasonable discretion, as applicable) (the “LIBO Screen Rate”) at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, two (2) Business Days prior to the commencement of such Interest Period; provided that, (x) if any LIBO Screen Rate shall be less than zero, such rate shall be deemed to be zero for purposes of this Agreement and (y) if the LIBO Screen Rate shall not be available at such time for such Interest Period (an “Impacted Interest Period”), then the LIBO Rate shall be the Interpolated Rate at such time, subject to Section 2.15 in the event that the Administrative Agent shall conclude that it shall not be possible to determine such Interpolated Rate (which conclusion shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error); provided further, that, if any Interpolated Rate shall be less than zero, such rate shall be deemed to be zero for purposes of this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the above, to the extent that “LIBO Rate” or “Adjusted LIBO Rate” is used in connection with an ABR Borrowing, such rate shall be determined as modified by the definition of Alternate Base Rate.1.3Deleted Definition.  The definition of “LMIR” shall be and it hereby is deleted from the Credit Agreement.1.4Letters of Credit.  The last sentence of Section 2.07(b) of the Credit Agreement shall be and it hereby is amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit the Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (i) the LC Exposure shall not exceed $350,000,000 and (ii) the Aggregate Credit Exposure shall not exceed the lesser of (1) the Borrowing Base then in effect and (2) the Aggregate Commitment.1.5Alternate Rate of Interest.  Section 2.15(a) of the Credit Agreement shall be and hereby is amended and restated in its entirety as follows:(a)the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining (including, without limitation, by means of an Interpolated Rate) the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period; or1.6Amendments to Organizational Documents.  Section 7.10 of the Credit Agreement shall be and hereby is amended and restated in its entirety as follows:The Borrower will not, nor will it permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, enter into or permit any material modification or amendment of, or waive any material right or obligation of any Person under its Organizational Documents other than (a) amendments, modifications or waivers required in connection with any transactions among the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries permitted under Section 7.03(a) and not involving any other Person, and (b) amendments or modifications of Organizational Documents that do not materially
