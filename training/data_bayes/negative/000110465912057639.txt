valorem, property, severance, Hydrocarbon production and similar Taxes based upon or measured by the ownership or operation of the Assets or the production of Hydrocarbons therefrom or allocated thereto, but excluding any other Taxes) and capital expenditures incurred in the ownership and operation of the Assets in the ordinary course of business and, where applicable, in accordance with the relevant operating or unit agreement, if any, and overhead costs charged to the Assets under the relevant operating agreement or unit agreement, if any, but excluding without limitation Claims attributable to (i) Claims for personal injury or death, property damage or violation of any Law, (ii) obligations to plug wells or dismantle, abandon and salvage facilities, (iii) any Environmental Liabilities or obligations to remediate any contamination of groundwater, surface water, soil, Equipment or Pipelines under applicable Environmental Laws, (iv) obligations to pay working interests, Royalty Amounts or other interests held in suspense, (v) obligations to pay Royalty Amounts, and (vi) Imbalances, all of which are addressed in Article 11, (v) any costs, expenses incurred by any Seller Indemnified Party to cure or attempt to cure any Title Defects or Environmental Defects., which such costs and expenses shall be the sole cost and expense of Seller and (vi) any costs or expenses (including any payments of principle or interest) incurred or paid with respect to obtaining any of the Asset Lien Releases. To the extent not inconsistent with GAAP or COPAS, for purposes of this Section 1.4, determination of whether Property Costs are attributable to the period before or after the Effective Time shall be based on when services are rendered, when the goods are delivered, or when the work is performed.  To the extent not inconsistent with GAAP or COPAS, for clarification, the date an item or work is ordered is not the date of a pre-Effective Time transaction for settlement purposes, but rather the date on which the item ordered is delivered to the job site, or the date on which the work ordered is performed, shall be the relevant date.  For purposes of allocating Hydrocarbon production (and accounts receivable with respect thereto), under this Section 1.4, (x) liquid Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be from or attributable to the Leases, Units and Wells when they pass through the pipeline connecting into the storage facilities into which they are run and (y) gaseous Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be from or attributable to the Leases, Units and Wells when they pass through the delivery point sales meters on the pipelines through which they are transported. Seller and Purchaser shall utilize reasonable interpolative procedures to arrive at an allocation of Hydrocarbon production when exact meter readings or gauging and strapping data is not available. Subject to final determination of the Purchaser Price and right to audit, Seller shall provide to Purchaser, no later than five (5) Business Days prior to Closing, all data necessary to support any estimated allocation, for purposes of establishing the adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.2 that will be used to determine the Closing Payment. Taxes, right-of-way fees, insurance premiums and other Property Costs that are paid periodically shall be prorated based on the number of days in the applicable period falling before and the number of days in the applicable period falling at or after the Effective Time, except that Hydrocarbon production, severance and similar Taxes shall be prorated based on the number of units actually produced, purchased or sold or proceeds of sale, as applicable, before, and at or after, the Effective Time.  If the actual amount of any Property Costs described in the preceding sentence is not known as of the Closing Date and/or as of the date of the calculation of the Closing Payment, then reasonable estimates for the amount of such Property Costs (based on the amount of such Property Costs as of the most recent prior period unless otherwise agreed by Purchaser and Seller) shall be used for purposes of calculating the adjusted Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.2 and Closing Payment pursuant to Section 9.4, respectively. In each case, Purchaser shall be responsible for the portion 
 
5






 
allocated to the period at and after the Effective Time and Seller shall be responsible for the portion allocated to the period before the Effective Time.
 
Section 1.5.           Delivery and Maintenance of Records.
 
Seller shall deliver the Records to Purchaser, at Purchasers expense, within fourteen (14) days following Closing. Purchaser shall be entitled to all original Records maintained by Seller. Seller shall be entitled to keep, at its sole cost and expense, a copy or copies of all Records; provided, however, that Seller shall not sell or otherwise allow any third party to review, copy or otherwise use copies of any Records retained by Seller except as otherwise required by Law.  Purchaser shall preserve the Records for a period of four (4) years following the Closing and will allow Seller and its representatives, consultants and advisors reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to the Records only to the extent reasonably required for Seller to comply with a Tax or other legally required reporting obligation or Tax or legal dispute.  Any such access shall be at the sole cost and expense of Seller.
 
ARTICLE II PURCHASE PRICE
 
Section 2.1.           Purchase Price.
 
The purchase price for the Assets (the Purchase Price) shall be Sixty Seven Million Dollars ($67,000,000.00) adjusted as provided in Section 2.2.
 
Section 2.2.           Adjustments to Purchase Price.
 
The Purchase Price for the Assets shall be adjusted in the manner specified below (without duplication), with all such amounts being determined in accordance with GAAP and COPAS standards, as applicable, in order to reach the Adjusted Purchase Price:
 
(a)           Reduced by the aggregate amount of the following proceeds received by Seller between (and including) the Effective Time and the Closing Date (with the period between the Effective Time and the Closing Date referred to as the Adjustment Period): (i) proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons (net of any Royalty Amounts, gathering, processing and transportation costs and any production, severance, sales, excise or similar Taxes not reimbursed to Seller by the purchaser of production) produced from or attributable to the Properties during the Adjustment Period, and (ii) other proceeds earned with respect to the Assets during the Adjustment Period;
 
(b)           Reduced to the extent provided in Section 7.7 with respect to Preference Rights and Retained Assets;
 
(c)           (i)  If the Parties or Seller make the election under Section 3.4(d)(i) with respect to a Title Defect, subject to the Individual Title Threshold and the Aggregate Defect Deductible, reduced by the Title Defect Amount with respect to such Title Defect if the Title Defect Amount has been determined prior to Closing and (ii) subject to the Individual Benefit Threshold and the 
 
6






 
Aggregate Benefit Deductible, increased by the Title Benefit Amount with respect to each Title Benefit for which the Title Benefit Amount has been determined prior to Closing;
 
(d)           Increased by the amount of all Property Costs and other costs attributable to the ownership and operation of the Assets which are paid by Seller and incurred during the Adjustment Period, except any Property Costs and other such costs already deducted in the determination of proceeds in Section 2.2(a);
 
(e)           Reduced to the extent provided in Section 3.4(d)(iii) for any Assets excluded from the Assets pursuant to Section 3.4(d)(iii) and reduced to the extent provided in Section 4.3 for Environmental Defects;
 
(f)            Increased or reduced as mutually agreed upon in writing prior to Closing by Seller and Purchaser;
 
(g)           Increased by the value of all unsold merchantable Hydrocarbons attributable to the Assets and stored in existing tanks, pipelines (as inventory but not as line-fill) and vessels to the bottom of the applicable flange as of the Effective Time (but only to the extent Seller can reasonably demonstrate through supporting documentation that Seller is entitled to receive delivery of, or compensation for, such Hydrocarbons unsold as of the Effective Time).  The adjustment shall be calculated at a price equal to the average price received by Seller from sales during the month of March, 2012 of comparable Hydrocarbons from each field from which such substances were produced, net of Royalty Amounts, gravity adjustments, quality bank adjustments, production payments, excise, severance and other production Taxes, marketing costs (which include for purposes hereof, among other things, costs of gathering, treating, processing, compression, and transportation) and other burdens upon, measured by, or payable out of such Hydrocarbon production.  Hydrocarbons in treating and separation equipment upstream of pipeline connections, as of the Effective Time, shall not be considered merchantable, and shall remain the property of Seller;
 
(h)           Reduced or increased, as the case may be, by the actual net aggregate Imbalances, if any, owed by Seller to third-parties or by third-parties to Seller, as of the Effective Time, multiplied by a price of equal to the average price received by Seller from sales during the month of March, 2012 of comparable Hydrocarbons from each field from which such substances were produced; and
 
(i)            Each adjustment made pursuant to Section 2.2(a) shall serve to satisfy, up to the amount of the adjustment, Purchasers entitlement under Section 1.4 to Hydrocarbon production from or attributable to the Properties during the Adjustment Period, and to the value of other income, proceeds, receipts and credits earned with respect to the Assets during the Adjustment Period, and as such, Purchaser shall not have any separate rights to receive any Hydrocarbon production or income, proceeds, receipts and credits with respect to which an adjustment has been made. Similarly, the adjustment described in Section 2.2(d) shall serve to satisfy, up to the amount of the adjustment, Purchasers obligation under Section 1.4 to pay Property Costs and other costs attributable to the ownership and operation of the Assets which are incurred during the Adjustment Period.

Upon the determination of the Final Purchase Price pursuant to Section 9.4(b), Seller shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser, for Purchasers review and approval, copies of IRS Form 8594 and any required exhibits thereto (the Asset Acquisition Statement) allocating, in accordance with the preceding sentence, the Final Purchase Price (together with any liabilities treated as purchase consideration for applicable Tax purposes) among the Assets.  Seller shall deliver to Purchaser, for Purchasers review and approval, from time to time revised copies of the Asset Acquisition Statement (the Revised Statements) so as to report any matters on the Asset Acquisition Statement that need updating (including purchase price adjustments, if any).  All income tax returns and reports filed by Purchaser or Seller shall be prepared consistently with the Asset Acquisition Statement or, if applicable, last Revised Statement.

Section 3.4.           Notice of Title Defect Adjustments.
 
(a)           To assert a claim of a Title Defect prior to Closing, Purchaser must deliver claim notices to Seller (each a Title Defect Notice) on or before May 29, 2012 at 5:00 p.m. (the Defect Claim Date). Each Title Defect Notice shall be in writing and shall include (i) a description of the alleged Title Defect(s), (ii) the Wells or Future Locations (limited to the depths shown on Exhibit B-1 and B-2) affected by the Title Defect (each a Title Defect Property), (iii) the Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property, (iv) supporting documents reasonably necessary for Seller (as well as any title attorney or examiner hired by Seller) to verify the existence of the alleged Title Defect(s), and (v) the amount by which Purchaser reasonably believes the Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property is reduced by the alleged Title Defect(s) and the computations and information upon which Purchasers belief is based. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived its right to assert Title Defects of which Seller has not been given notice on or before the Defect Claim Date. For purposes hereof, the Allocated Value of an Asset shall mean the portion of the Purchase Price that has been allocated to a particular Well or Future Location (limited to the depths shown on Exhibit B-1 and B-2) as prepared by Purchaser and reviewed for reasonableness by Seller.
 
(b)           Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to deliver to Purchaser on or before the Defect Claim Date, with respect to each Title Benefit, a notice (a Title Benefit Notice) including (i) a description of the Title Benefit and the supporting documents reasonably necessary for Purchaser (as well as any title attorney or examiner hired by Purchaser) to verify the existence of the Title Benefit(s), (ii) the Wells and Future Locations (limited to the depths shown on Exhibit B-1 and B-2) in Exhibit B-1 and B-2affected, (iii) the Allocated Values of the Wells and Future Locations (limited to the depths shown on Exhibit B-1 and B-2) in Exhibit B-1 and B-2 subject to such Title Benefit and (iv) the amount by which Seller reasonably believes the Allocated Value of the Wells and Future Locations (limited to the depths shown on Exhibit B-1 and B-2) is increased by the Title Benefit, and the computations and information upon which Sellers belief is based. Seller shall be deemed to have waived all Title Benefits of which Seller has not given notice to Purchaser on or before the Defect Claim Date.
 
(c)           With respect to any Title Defects of which it has been advised in writing by Purchaser, unless the Parties otherwise agree, Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at Sellers sole cost, to cure or remove Title Defects at any time prior to Closing (the Cure Period).
 
(d)           Remedies for Title Defects.
 
In the event that any Title Defect is not waived by Purchaser or cured on or before Closing, Purchaser and Seller shall mutually elect to have one of the following remedies apply:
 
(i)                subject to the Individual Title Threshold and the Aggregate Defect Deductible, have the Purchase Price reduced by an amount agreed upon by Purchaser and Seller or as determined pursuant to Section 3.4(g) or Section 3.4(i) as being the value of such Title Defect(Title Defect Amount), taking into consideration the Allocated Value of the Property subject to such Title Defect, the portion of the Property subject to such
 
12







 
Title Defect and the legal effect of such Title Defect on the Property affected thereby; provided, however, that the methodology, terms and conditions of Section 3.4(g) shall control any such determination;
 
(ii)               have Seller retain, as an Excluded Asset,  the entirety of the Property that is subject to such Title Defect, together with all associated Assets, in which event the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Property; or
 
(iii)              have Seller retain the entirety of the Property that is subject to such Title Defect, together with all associated Assets, and notify Purchaser at Closing that it elects to attempt to cure such Title Defect within 90 days after Closing.  In such event, the Purchase Price shall be reduced at Closing  by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such retained Property. Any Property so held back from the initial Closing will be conveyed to Purchaser and the amount of the reduction in the Purchase Price paid to Seller at a delayed Closing within thirty (30) days following the date that the Title Defect is cured. If multiple delayed Closings are contemplated as a result of this provision and/or Section 7.7(c), the delayed Closings may be consolidated on dates mutually agreeable to the parties.  In the event that Seller is unable to cure the Title Defect within 90 days of the initial Closing, then neither Party shall have any further obligation to the other relating to such Property and such Property shall permanently constitute Excluded Assets.
 
In the event that Purchaser and Seller cannot mutually agree upon one of the foregoing remedies with respect to a Title Defect asserted by Purchaser pursuant to Section 3.4(a) prior to Closing, then Seller shall, at its sole election, select the remedy set forth in subsection (i), (ii) or (iii) above as the remedy for such Title Defect.
 
(e)           With respect to each Well and Future Location in Exhibit  B-1 and B-2 affected by Title Benefits reported under Section 3.4(b), subject to the Individual Benefit Threshold and the Aggregate Benefit Deductible, the Purchase Price shall be increased by an amount (the Title Benefit Amount) equal to the increase in the Allocated Value for such Well and Future Location in Exhibit  B-1 and B-2 caused by such Title Benefits, as determined pursuant to Section 3.4(h).
 
(f)            Section 3.4(d) shall be the exclusive right and remedy of Purchaser with respect to Title Defects asserted by Purchaser pursuant to Section 3.4(a).  Section 3.4(e) shall be the exclusive right and remedy of Seller with respect to Title Benefits asserted by Seller pursuant to Section 3.4(b).
 
(g)           The Title Defect Amount resulting from a Title Defect shall be the amount by which the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property is reduced as a result of the existence of such Title Defect and shall be determined in accordance with the following methodology, terms and conditions:
 
(i)                if Purchaser and Seller agree on the Title Defect Amount, that amount shall be the Title Defect Amount;
 
13






 
(ii)               if the Title Defect is a lien, encumbrance or other charge which is undisputed and liquidated in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the amount necessary to be paid to remove the Title Defect from the Title Defect Property;
 
(iii)              if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (A) the Net Revenue Interest for any Title Defect Property and (B) the Net Revenue Interest stated on Exhibit B, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Net Revenue Interest decrease attributable to such Title Defect and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest stated on Exhibit B;
 
(iv)              if the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden or charge upon or other defect in title to the Title Defect Property of a type not described in subsections (i), (ii) or (iii) above, the Title Defect Amount shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property, the portion of the Title Defect Property affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect, the potential economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of the Title Defect Property, the values placed upon the Title Defect by Purchaser and Seller and such other factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation; and
 
(v)               notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 3, the aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title Defects upon any Title Defect Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property.
 
(h)           The Title Benefit Amount for any Title Benefit shall be the product of the Allocated Value of the affected Well in Exhibit B multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Net Revenue Interest increase attributable to such Title Benefit and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest stated on Exhibit B.
 
(i)            Seller and Purchaser shall attempt in good faith to agree on all Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts prior to Closing. If Seller and Purchaser are unable to agree by Closing, the Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts in dispute shall be exclusively and finally resolved pursuant to this Section 3.4(i). There shall be a single arbitrator, who shall be a title attorney with at least ten (10) years experience in oil and gas titles involving properties in the regional area in which the Properties are located, as selected by mutual agreement of Purchaser and Seller within fifteen (15) Business Days after the end of the Cure Period (the Title Expert). The Title Experts determination shall be made within fifteen (15) Business Days after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding upon both Parties, without right of appeal. In making his determination, the Title Expert shall be bound by the rules set forth in Section 3.4(g) and Section 3.4(h) and may consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Title Expert are necessary or helpful to make a proper determination. The Title Expert may allow the Parties to make written submissions of their positions in the manner and to the extent the Title Expert deems appropriate, and the Title Expert may call on the Parties to submit such other materials as the Title Expert deems helpful and appropriate to resolution of the dispute.  Additionally, the Title Expert may consult with and engage disinterested third parties to advise the arbitrator, including without limitation petroleum engineers. The Title Expert shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed Title Defect Amounts 
 
14






 
and Title Benefit Amounts submitted by either Party and may not award damages, interest or penalties to either Party with respect to any matter. Seller and Purchaser shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case. Each Party shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Title Expert, including any costs incurred by the Title Expert that are attributable to such third party consultation. Within ten (10) days after the Title Expert delivers written notice to Purchaser and Seller of his award with respect to a Title Defect Amount or a Title Benefit Amount, (i) Purchaser shall pay to Seller the amount, if any, so awarded by the Title Expert to Seller, and (ii) Seller shall pay to Purchaser the amount, if any, so awarded by the Title Expert to Purchaser.
 
(j)            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (i) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller for any individual uncured Title Defect for which the Title Defect Amount therefor does not exceed  $25,000  (Individual Title Threshold); and (ii) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller for uncured Title Defects unless the aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to all uncured Title Defects, taken together with the aggregate Environmental Defect Amounts attributable to all uncured Environmental Defects, exceeds a deductible in an amount equal to two  percent (2%) of the Purchase Price  (Aggregate Defect Deductible), after which point adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies shall be made or available to Purchaser only with respect to uncured Title Defects and uncured Environmental Defects where the aggregate Title Defect Amounts and Environmental Defect Amounts attributable are in excess of such Aggregate Defect Deductible. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (i) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price for any individual Title Benefit for which the Title Benefit Amount does not exceed  $25,000  (Individual Benefit Threshold); and (ii) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price for any Title Benefit unless the aggregate Title Benefit Amounts attributable to all such Title Benefits, exceeds a deductible in an amount equal to  two  percent (2%) of the Purchase Price  (Aggregate Benefit Deductible), after which point adjustments to the Purchase Price shall be made only with respect to such Title Benefit Amounts in excess of such Aggregate Benefit Deductible.
 
Section 3.5.           Casualty or Condemnation Loss.
 
(a)           From and after the Effective Time, but subject to the provisions of Section 3.5(b) and (c) below, Purchaser shall assume all risk of loss with respect to and any change in the condition of the Assets and for production of Hydrocarbons through normal depletion (including but not limited to the watering out of any Well, collapsed casing or sand infiltration of any Well) and the depreciation of personal property due to ordinary wear and tear with respect to the Assets.
 
(b)           If, after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Closing Date, any portion of the Assets is destroyed by fire or other casualty or is taken in condemnation or under right of eminent domain, and the loss as a result of such individual casualty or taking, taken together with all other casualty losses and takings, is less than  $25,000, the transactions evidenced by this Agreement shall nevertheless be consummated and Seller shall elect by written notice to Purchaser prior to Closing either (i) to cause the Assets affected by any casualty or taking to be repaired or restored to at least its condition prior to such casualty, at Sellers sole cost, as 
 
15






 
promptly as reasonably practicable (which work may extend after the Closing Date)  or (ii) to treat such casualty or taking as a Title Defect with respect to the affected Property or Properties under Section 3.4.  In each case, Seller shall retain all rights to insurance and other claims against third parties with respect to the casualty or taking except to the extent the parties otherwise agree in writing.
 
(c)           If, after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Closing Date, any portion of the Assets is destroyed by fire or other casualty or is taken in condemnation or under right of eminent domain, and the loss to the Assets as a result of such individual casualty or taking, taken together with all other casualty losses and takings, is $25,000  or more, the transaction evidenced by this Agreement shall nevertheless be consummated and Seller shall, at Closing, pay to Purchaser all sums paid to Seller by third parties by reason of such casualty or taking and shall assign, transfer and set over to Purchaser all of Sellers right, title and interest (if any) in insurance claims, unpaid awards, and other rights against third parties (other than Affiliates of Seller and its and their directors, officers, employees and agents) arising out of the casualty or taking.
 
Section 3.6.           Limitations on Applicability.
 
The right of Purchaser to assert a Title Defect under this Agreement and Sellers right to assert a Title Benefit under this Agreement shall terminate as of the Defect Claim Date, provided there shall be no termination of Purchasers or Sellers rights under Section 3.4 with respect to any bona fide Title Defect properly reported in a Title Defect Notice or bona fide Title Benefit properly reported in a Title Benefit Notice on or before the Defect Claim Date.
 
Section 3.7.           Government Approvals Respecting Assets.
 
(a)           Purchaser shall, within thirty (30) days after Closing and at Purchasers own expense, file for approval with the applicable Governmental Bodies all assignment documents and other state and federal transfer documents required to effectuate the transfer of the Assets. Purchaser further agrees, promptly after Closing, to take all other actions reasonably required of it by federal or state agencies having jurisdiction to obtain all requisite regulatory approvals with respect to this transaction, and to use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the approval by such federal or state agencies, as applicable, of Sellers assignment documents requiring federal or state approval in order for Purchaser to be recognized by the federal or state agencies as the owner of the Assets.

Section 4.1.           Assessment.
 
From and after the date of execution of this Agreement until the Closing Date, Seller shall afford to Purchaser and its officers, employees, agents and authorized representatives reasonable access to the Assets, including the Records in accordance with Section 7.1. During such period, Seller shall also make available to Purchaser, upon reasonable notice during normal business hours, Sellers personnel knowledgeable with respect to the Assets in order that Purchaser may make such diligent investigation as Purchaser considers desirable. For those Properties that are not operated by Seller or Sellers Affiliates, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain permission from the operator for Purchaser to conduct such inspections but, provided Seller has exercised such commercially reasonable efforts, Seller shall have no liability to Purchaser for failure to obtain any such operators permission; provided, however, if Purchaser is prevented from conducting any Assessment with respect to any Asset due to the failure of any operator to permit such Assessment then Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, elect to exclude such Asset, in which case such Asset shall be deemed to constitute an Excluded Asset for all purposes and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such excluded Assets.  Upon reasonable notice to Seller, Purchaser shall have the right to conduct an environmental assessment of all or any portion of the Properties (the Assessment), to be conducted by a reputable environmental consulting or engineering firm approved in advance in writing by Seller (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld), but only to the extent that Seller may grant such right without violating any obligations to any third party (provided that Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any necessary third party consents to any Assessment to be conducted by Purchaser). The Assessment shall be conducted at the sole cost and expense of Purchaser, and shall be subject to the indemnity provisions of Section 4.4. Prior to conducting any sampling, boring, drilling or other invasive investigative activity with respect to the Properties (Invasive Activity), Purchaser shall furnish for Sellers review a proposed scope of such Invasive Activity, including a description of the activities to be conducted and a description of the approximate locations of such activities. If any of the proposed activities may unreasonably interfere with normal operation of the Properties, Seller may require an appropriate modification of the proposed Invasive Activity. Seller shall have the right to be present during any Assessment of the Properties and shall have the right, at its option and expense, to split samples with Purchaser. After completing any Assessment of the Properties, Purchaser shall, at its sole cost and expense, restore the Properties to the condition which existed immediately prior to the commencement of such Assessment, unless Seller 
 
17






 
requests otherwise, and Purchaser shall promptly dispose of all drill cuttings, corings, or other investigative-derived wastes generated in the course of the Assessment. Purchaser shall maintain, and shall cause its officers, employees, representatives, consultants and advisors to maintain, all information obtained by Purchaser pursuant to any Assessment or other due diligence activity as strictly confidential until the Closing occurs, unless disclosure of any facts discovered through such Assessment is required under any Laws. Purchaser shall provide Seller with a copy of the final version of all environmental reports prepared by, or on behalf of, Purchaser with respect to any Assessment or Invasive Activity conducted on the Properties. In the event that any necessary disclosures under applicable Laws are required with respect to matters discovered by any Assessment conducted by, for or on behalf of Purchaser, (a) prior to Closing and to the extent related to any Excluded Assets, Purchaser agrees that Seller shall be the responsible party for disclosing such matters to the appropriate Governmental Bodies and (b) from and after Closing and to the extent related to the Assets, Purchaser agrees that Seller shall may be the responsible party for disclosing such matters to the appropriate Governmental Bodies; provided that in either case of (a) or (b), any Party or its Affiliate may promptly make any such required disclosure such Party or its Affiliates are legally obligated to make such disclosure and such Person shall have the right to fully comply with such legal obligation.
 
Section 4.2.           NORM, Wastes and Other Substances.
 
Purchaser acknowledges that the Assets have been used for the exploration, development, and production of Hydrocarbons and that there may be petroleum, produced water, wastes, or other substances or materials located in, on or under the Properties or associated with the Assets. Equipment and sites included in the Assets may contain Hazardous Materials, including NORM. NORM may affix or attach itself to the inside of wells, materials, and equipment as scale, or in other forms. The wells, materials, and equipment located on the Properties or included in the Assets may contain Hazardous Materials, including NORM. Hazardous Materials, including NORM, may have come in contact with various environmental media, including without limitation, water, soils or sediment. Special procedures may be required for the assessment, remediation, removal, transportation, or disposal of environmental media and Hazardous Materials, including NORM, from the Assets Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this Section 4.2 shall limit, restrict or reduce the right of Purchaser to assert any Environmental Liabilities, Release of Hazardous Material, condition or matter described herein as an Environmental Defect under Article 4.3.
 
Section 4.3.           Environmental Defects.
 
If Purchaser determines that with respect to the Assets, there exists as of the Effective Time (i) the failure of the ownership and operation of the Assets to be in compliance with applicable Environmental Laws or (ii) any Release of Hazardous Substances resulting from Hydrocarbon activities that has occurred or is occurring at, on, in or under any Asset that is required to be remediated, monitored, investigated, cured or any other action required under applicable Environmental Laws or (iii) any Environmental Liabilities (in each case of the foregoing, an Environmental Defect), then on or prior to the Defect Claim Date, Purchaser may notify Seller in writing of such Environmental Defect (an Environmental Defect Notice). EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO ANY BREACHES OF SECTION 5.21, FOR ALL PURPOSES OF THIS AGREEMENT, PURCHASER SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE 
 
18






 
WAIVED ANY ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECT WHICH PURCHASER FAILS TO ASSERT AS AN ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECT BY AN ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECT NOTICE RECEIVED BY SELLER ON OR BEFORE THE ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIM DATE. To be effective, each such notice shall set forth (i) a description of the matter constituting the alleged Environmental Defect, (ii) the Wells and associated Assets affected by the Environmental Defect, (iii) the estimated liquidated Environmental Liabilities (based on the Lowest Cost Response in the case of remediation) arising out of or attributable to such Environmental Defect in question (the Environmental Defect Amount), and (iv) supporting documents reasonably necessary for Seller to identify the existence of the alleged Environmental Defect and the Environmental Defect Amount. Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to cure any Environmental Defect before Closing at the sole cost and expense of Seller. If Seller disagrees with any of Purchasers assertions with respect to the existence of an Environmental Defect or the Environmental Defect Amount, Purchaser and Seller will attempt to resolve the dispute prior to Closing. If the dispute cannot be resolved within ten (10) days of the first meeting of Purchaser and Seller, either Party may submit the dispute to Carr and Associates (the Independent Expert). The Independent Expert may elect to conduct the dispute resolution proceeding by written submissions from Purchaser and Seller with exhibits, including interrogatories, supplemented with appearances by Purchaser and Seller, if necessary, as the Independent Expert may deem necessary. After the Parties and Independent Expert have had the opportunity to review all such submissions, the Independent Expert shall call for a final, written offer of resolution from each Party. The Independent Expert shall render its decision within fifteen (15) Business Days of receiving such offers by selecting one or the other of the offers, or by crafting a decision that represents a resolution between the two offers.

Purchasers approval of any action restricted by this Section 7.6 shall be considered granted within ten (10) days (unless a shorter time is reasonably required by the circumstances and such shorter time is specified in Sellers written notice) of Sellers written notice to Purchaser requesting such consent unless Purchaser notifies Seller to the contrary in writing during that period. In the event of an emergency, Seller may take such action as a prudent operator would take and shall notify Purchaser of such action promptly thereafter.
 
Purchaser acknowledges that Seller may own an undivided interest in certain of the Assets, and Purchaser agrees that the acts or omissions of the other working interest owners who are not affiliated with Seller shall not constitute a violation of the provisions of this Section 7.6 nor shall any action required by a vote of working interest owners constitute such a violation so long as Seller has voted its interest in a manner consistent with the provisions of this Section 7.6.
 
Section 7.7.           Preference Rights and Transfer Requirements.
 
(a)           The transactions contemplated by this Agreement are expressly subject to all validly existing and applicable Preference Rights and Transfer Requirements. Within ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof, Seller shall initiate all procedures which are reasonably required to comply with or obtain the waiver of all Preference Rights and Transfer Requirements set forth in Schedule 5.13 with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all applicable consents and to obtain waivers of applicable Preference Rights; provided, however, Seller shall not be obligated to pay any consideration to (or incur any cost or expense for the benefit of) the holder of any Preference Right or Transfer Requirement in order to obtain the waiver thereof or compliance therewith.
 
31






 
(b)           If the holder of a Preference Right elects prior to Closing to purchase the Asset subject to a Preference Right (a Preference Property) in accordance with the terms of such Preference Right, and Seller receives written notice of such election prior to the Closing, such Preference Property will be eliminated from the Assets and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of the Preference Property.
 
(c)           If
 
(i)                a third party brings any suit, action or other proceeding prior to the Closing seeking to restrain, enjoin or otherwise prohibit the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby in connection with a claim to enforce a Preference Right;
 
(ii)               an Asset is subject to a Transfer Requirement that provides that transfer of such Asset without compliance with such Transfer Requirement will result in termination or other material impairment of any rights in relation to such Asset or either Party will incur any material Liability, and such Transfer Requirement is not waived, complied with or otherwise satisfied prior to the Closing Date; or
 
(iii)              the holder of a Preference Right does not elect to purchase such Preference Property or waive such Preference Right with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement prior to the Closing Date and the time in which the Preference Right may be exercised has not expired;
 
then, unless otherwise agreed by Seller and Purchaser, the Asset or portion thereof affected by such Preference Right or Transfer Requirement (a Retained Asset) shall be held back from the Assets to be transferred and conveyed to Purchaser at Closing and the Purchase Price to be paid at Closing shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such Retained Asset pursuant to Section 7.7(b). Any Retained Asset so held back at the initial Closing will be conveyed to Purchaser at a delayed Closing (which shall become the new Closing Date with respect to such Retained Asset), within ten (10) days following the date on which the suit, action or other proceeding, if any, referenced in clause (i) above is settled or a judgment is rendered (and no longer subject to appeal) permitting transfer of the Retained Asset to Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement and Seller obtains, complies with, obtains a waiver of or notice of election not to exercise or otherwise satisfies all remaining Preference Rights and Transfer Requirements with respect to such Retained Asset as contemplated by this Section 7.7(c) (or if multiple Assets are Retained Assets, on a date mutually agreed to by the Parties in order to consolidate, to the extent reasonably possible, the number of Closings). At the delayed Closing, Purchaser shall pay Seller a purchase price equal to the amount by which the Purchase Price was reduced on account of the holding back of such Retained Asset (as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.2 through the new Closing Date therefor); provided, however, if all such Preference Rights and Transfer Requirements with respect to any Retained Asset so held back at the initial Closing are not obtained, complied with, waived or otherwise satisfied as contemplated by this Section within one hundred eighty (180) days after the initial Closing has occurred with respect to any Asset, then such Retained Asset shall be eliminated from the Assets and shall become an Excluded Asset, unless Seller and Purchaser agree to proceed with a closing on such Retained Asset, in which case Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived any objection (and shall be obligated to
 
32







 
indemnify the Seller Indemnified Persons for all Claims) with respect to non-compliance with such Preference Rights and Transfer Requirements with respect to such Retained Asset(s).
 
(d)           Purchaser acknowledges that Seller desires to sell all of the Assets to Purchaser and would not have entered into this Agreement but for Purchasers agreement to purchase all of the Assets as herein provided. Accordingly, it is expressly understood and agreed that Seller does not desire to sell any Property affected by a Preference Right to Purchaser unless the sale of all of the Assets is consummated by the Closing Date in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, Sellers obligation hereunder to sell the Preference Properties to Purchaser is expressly conditioned upon the consummation by the Closing Date of the sale of all of the Assets (other than Retained Assets or other Assets excluded pursuant to the express provisions of this Agreement) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, either by conveyance to Purchaser or conveyance pursuant to an applicable Preference Right; provided that, nothing herein is intended or shall operate to extend or apply any Preference Right to any portion of the Assets which is not otherwise burdened thereby. Time is of the essence with respect to the Parties agreement to consummate the sale of the Assets by the Closing Date (or by the delayed Closing Date pursuant to Section 7.7(c)).
 
Section 7.8.           Tax Matters.
 
(a)           Subject to the provisions of Section 12.3, Seller shall be responsible for all Taxes related to the Assets (other than ad valorem, property, severance, Hydrocarbon production and similar Taxes based upon or measured by the ownership or operation of the Assets or the production of Hydrocarbons therefrom, which are addressed in Section 1.4) attributable to any period of time at or prior to the Closing Date, and Purchaser shall be responsible for all such Taxes related to the Assets attributable to any period of time after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall handle payment to the appropriate Governmental Body of all Taxes with respect to the Assets which are required to be paid prior to Closing (and shall file all tax returns with respect to such Taxes). If requested by Purchaser, Seller will assist Purchaser with preparation of all ad valorem and property tax returns for periods ending on or before December 31, 2012 (including any extensions requested). Seller shall deliver to Purchaser within thirty (30) days of filing copies of all tax returns to be filed by Seller relating to the Assets and any supporting documentation to be provided by Seller to Governmental Bodies for Purchasers approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, excluding tax returns related to income tax, franchise tax, or other similar Taxes. Purchaser shall file all tax returns covering Taxes treated as Property Costs that are required to be filed after the Closing Date unless covered above. With respect to such tax returns covering a taxable period which includes the Effective Time, Purchaser shall provide a copy of such tax return to Seller within 30 days prior to filing for Sellers approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
 
(b)           Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing of any tax returns and any audit, litigation or other Proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other Partys request) the provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other Proceeding and making employees reasonably available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Each of Purchaser and Seller agrees (i) to retain
 
33






 
all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the acquired assets relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Purchaser or Seller, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Governmental Body, and (ii) to give the other Party reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the other Party so requests, each Party shall allow the other Party the option of taking possession of such books and records prior to their disposal. Purchaser and Seller further agree, upon request, to use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental Body or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed with respect to the transactions contemplated hereunder.
 
(c)           Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection of accommodating a 1031 exchange (as provided for under Section 1031 of the Code). Purchaser or Seller reserves the right, at or prior to Closing, to assign its rights under this Agreement with respect to all or a portion of the Purchase Price, and that portion of the Assets associated therewith (1031 Assets), to a Qualified Intermediary (as that term is defined in Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)(v) of the Treasury Regulations) to accomplish this transaction, in whole or in part, in a manner that will comply with the requirements of a like-kind exchange (Like-Kind Exchange) pursuant to Section 1031 of the Code. If Purchaser so elects, Purchaser may assign its rights under this Agreement to the 1031 Assets to the Qualified Intermediary. Seller hereby (i) consents to Purchasers assignment of its rights in this Agreement with respect to the 1031 Assets, and (ii) if such an assignment is made, agrees to transfer all or a portion of the Assets into the qualified trust account at Closing as directed in writing by Purchaser. Purchaser and Seller each acknowledge and agree that a whole or partial assignment of this Agreement to a Qualified Intermediary shall not release the other Party from any of its respective promises, liabilities and obligations to the other Party or expand any promises, liabilities or obligations of such Party under this Agreement. Neither Party represents to the other that any particular tax treatment will be given to either Party as a result of the Like-Kind Exchange. Neither Party shall be obligated to pay any additional costs or incur any additional obligations in its sale of the Assets if such costs are the result of the other Partys Like-Kind Exchange, and each Party shall defend, hold harmless and indemnify the other Party from and against all Claims (including reasonable attorneys fees, court costs and related expenses), if any, resulting from such a Like-Kind Exchange.
 
Section 7.9.           Further Assurances.
 
After the Closing, Seller and Purchaser and their Affiliates shall execute, acknowledge and deliver all such further conveyances, transfer orders, division orders, notices assumptions, releases and acquittances, and such other instruments, and shall take such further actions as may be necessary or appropriate to assure fully to Purchaser or Seller (including their successors and assigns) as the case may be, that the transactions described in this Agreement shall be completed and that all of the Properties intended to be conveyed under the terms of this Agreement are so conveyed, including such Properties that are improperly described herein or inadvertently omitted from this Agreement and/or the Conveyance (including the Exhibits attached to each) and to assure fully that (a) Purchaser has assumed the Assumed Seller Obligations and other Claims and intended to be assumed by Purchaser pursuant to this 
 
34






 
Agreement and (b) Seller has retained the Retained Obligations and other Claims intended to be retained by Seller pursuant to this Agreement.
 
Section 7.10.        Asset Lien Releases.
 
On or prior to Closing, Seller shall, at is sole cost and expense, obtain and deliver to Purchaser the Asset Lien Releases.  Seller shall deliver all notices and take all other actions necessary to facilitate the execution and delivery of the Asset Lien Releases and after Closing the release of all Liens on the Assets securing any and all indebtedness for borrowed money of Seller or its Affiliates.

(a)           Not later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser, based upon the best information available to Seller, a preliminary settlement statement estimating the Adjusted Purchase Price after giving effect to all adjustments listed in Section 2.2.

In the event that Seller and Purchaser cannot reach agreement by the Final Settlement Date, either Party may refer the remaining matters in dispute to a nationally recognized independent accounting firm as may be mutually accepted by Purchaser and Seller, for review and final determination (the Agreed Accounting Firm).  Each Party shall summarize its position with regard to the remaining matters in dispute in a written document of twenty-five pages or less and submit such summaries to the Agreed Accounting Firm, together with any other documentation such Party may desire to submit.

All other representations and warranties of Seller and Purchaser contained herein shall terminate one (1) year after the initial Closing.  Upon the termination of a representation or warranty in accordance with the foregoing, such representation or warranty shall have no further force or effect for any purpose under this Agreement except as provided in Section 11.4(b). The covenants and other agreements of Seller and Purchaser set forth in this Agreement shall survive the Closing indefinitely. Any Claim arising out of fraud, fraudulent inducement or the willful misconduct of a Party in connection with the marketing, negotiation or inducement to enter into this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder shall terminate one (1) year after the initial Closing Date.
 
(b)           No Party hereto shall have any indemnification obligation pursuant to this Article 11 or otherwise in respect of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement unless it shall have received from the Party seeking indemnification a written notice (a Claim Notice) of the existence of the Claim for or in respect of which indemnification in respect of such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement is being sought on or before the expiration of the applicable survival period, if any, set forth in Section 11.4(a) for such Claim. If an Indemnified Party delivers a Claim Notice to an Indemnifying Party before the expiration of the applicable survival period, if any,  set forth in Section 11.4(a) for such Claim, then the applicable representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall survive until, but only for

purposes of, the resolution of the matter covered by such Claim Notice. A Claim Notice shall set forth with reasonable specificity (i) the basis for such Claim under this Agreement, and the facts that otherwise form the basis of such Claim and (ii) to the extent reasonably estimable, an estimate of the amount of such Claim (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such Claim) and an explanation of the calculation of such estimate; provided, however, the failure of such Claim Notice to completely describe such Claims or facts shall in no way reduce or limit the rights or obligations of any Party hereunder with respect to such Claim or facts.
 
(c)                                  Neither Seller nor Purchaser shall have any liability for any indemnification under this Agreement, nor any liability for breach of any representations, warranties, or covenant under this Agreement, until and unless (i) the amount of the liability for any individual Claim or series of Claims arising out of the same or similar set of facts, for which a Claim Notice is delivered by Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, exceeds $25,000 (Individual Indemnity Threshold), and (ii) the aggregate amount of the liabilities for all Claims for which Claim Notices are delivered by Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, exceeds one percent (1%) of the Purchase Price, and then only to the extent such damages exceed one percent (1%) of the Purchase Price (the Aggregate Indemnity Deductible); provided that, such deductible shall not be applicable to any Claims arising out of or related to any Fundamental Representations, Royalty Amounts, Property Costs, Imbalances or Taxes for which the Purchase Price was not previously reduced pursuant to Section 2.2. In no event shall Seller be obligated to indemnify Purchaser with respect to all breaches of representations, warranty or covenants of Seller for an aggregate amount in excess of twenty percent (20%) of the Purchase Price; provided that, Sellers obligation under Section 11.5 to indemnify relating to Fundamental Representations, the covenant set forth in Section 7.6(vi) and Sellers indemnity obligations under Sections 11.5(c) and (e) shall not be subject to the limitations contained in this Section 11.4(c).

The calculation of the amount of Claims for breach (but not the determination of the occurrence of such breach) of any representation or warranty of any Party hereto shall be determined without giving effect to any qualifiers as to materiality, Material Adverse Effect or material adverse effect set forth in any such representations or warranties.

Section 11.7.                         Indemnification Proceedings.
 
(a)                                  In the event that any claim or demand for which Seller or Purchaser (such Person, an Indemnifying Party) may be liable to a Purchaser Indemnified Person under Section 11.5 or to a Seller Indemnified Person under Section 11.6 (an Indemnified Party) is asserted against or
 
45






 
sought to be collected from an Indemnified Party by a third party (a Third Party Claim,) the Indemnified Party shall with reasonable promptness notify the Indemnifying Party of such Third Party Claim by delivery of a Claim Notice, provided that the failure or delay to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Article 11, except (and solely) to the extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that its defense of such Third Party Claim is actually and materially prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from receipt of the Claim Notice from the Indemnified Party (in this Section 11.7, the Notice Period) to notify the Indemnified Party whether or not the Indemnifying Party desires, at the Indemnifying Partys sole cost and expense, to defend the Indemnified Party against such claim or demand; provided, that the Indemnified Party is hereby authorized prior to and during the Notice Period, and at the cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, to file any motion, answer or other pleading that it shall reasonably deem necessary to protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim only if and for so long as the Indemnifying Party (i) notifies the Indemnified Party during the Notice Period that the Indemnifying Party is assuming the defense of such Third Party Claim, (ii) uses counsel of its own choosing that is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, and (iii) conducts the defense of such Third Party Claim in an active and diligent manner. If the Indemnifying Party is entitled to, and does, assume the defense of any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel at its own expense and to participate in the defense thereof; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall pay the reasonable attorneys fees of the Indemnified Party if the Indemnified Partys counsel shall have advised the Indemnified Party that there is a conflict of interest that could make it inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct to have common counsel for the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party (provided that the Indemnifying Party shall not be responsible for paying for more than one separate firm of attorneys and one local counsel to represent all of the Indemnified Parties subject to such Third Party Claim). If the Indemnifying Party elects (and is entitled) to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, (i) no compromise or settlement thereof or consent to any admission or the entry of any judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim may be effected by the Indemnifying Party without the Indemnified Partys written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party (and no injunctive or other equitable relief is imposed upon the Indemnified Party) and there is an unconditional provision whereby each plaintiff or claimant in such Third Party Claim releases the Indemnified Party from all Claims with respect thereto and (ii) the Indemnified Party shall have no liability, or limitation of any right or benefit of, with respect to any compromise or settlement thereof effected without its written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld). If the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim (or fails to give notice to the Indemnified Party during the Notice Period or otherwise is not entitled to assume such defense), the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim with counsel of its own choice, at the expense and for the account of the Indemnifying Party; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party shall make no settlement, compromise, admission, or acknowledgment that would give rise to Claims on the part of any Indemnifying Party without the prior written consent of such Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
 
46






 
(b)                                 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to control (but shall be entitled to participate at its own expense in the defense of), and the Indemnified Party, shall be entitled to have sole control over, the defense or settlement, compromise, admission, or acknowledgment of any Third Party Claim (i) at the reasonable expense of the Indemnifying Party, as to which the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense during the Notice Period after the Indemnified Party gives notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party or (ii) at the reasonable expense of the Indemnifying Party, to the extent the Third Party Claim seeks an order, injunction, or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party which, if successful, could materially adversely affect the business, condition (financial or other), capitalization, assets, liabilities, results of operations or prospects of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall make no settlement, compromise, admission, or acknowledgment that would give rise to liability on the part of, or limitation of any right or benefit of, the Indemnifying Party without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
 
(c)                                  In any case in which an Indemnified Party seeks indemnification hereunder and no Third Party Claim is involved, the Indemnified Party shall deliver a Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party within a reasonably prompt period of time after an officer of such Indemnified Party or its Affiliates has obtained Actual Knowledge of the Claim giving rise to indemnification hereunder. The failure or delay to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Article 11 except to the extent such failure results in insufficient time being available to permit the Indemnifying Party to effectively mitigate the resulting Claims or otherwise prejudices the Indemnifying Party.
 
(d)                                 If a Party has knowledge before Closing with respect to the inaccuracy, breach or noncompliance of any representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement contained in this Agreement, such Party shall be deemed to have waived such inaccuracy, breach or noncompliance if such inaccuracy, breach or non-compliance is not asserted prior to or at Closing and in no event shall such Party have the right to indemnification under this Article 11 relating to such inaccuracy, breach or noncompliance.
 
(e)                                  The Parties shall treat, for tax purposes, any amounts paid under this Article 11 as an adjustment to the Adjusted Purchase Price.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the indemnity obligations and adjustments to the Purchaser Price set forth herein shall be determined without duplication.
