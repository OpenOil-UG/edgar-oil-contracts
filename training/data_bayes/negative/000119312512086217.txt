the 2010 Determination Letter  Apache Corporation (Apache) sponsors the Apache Corporation 401(k) Savings Plan (the
Plan). In section 10.4 of the Plan, Apache reserved the right to amend the Plan from time to time. Apache hereby exercises that right, as follows.  1. Section 1.14(d)(i) of the Plan shall be replaced in its entirety with the following, effective as of January 1, 2012. 
 


 
(i)
Inclusions. Specifically, Compensation includes:   


 
(A)
Regular salary or wages,   


 
(B)
Overtime pay,   


 
(C)
The regular annual bonus (unless all or a portion is excluded by the Committee before the regular annual bonus is paid) and any other bonus designated by the Committee,
  


 
(D)
Salary reductions pursuant to this Plan,   


 
(E)
Salary reductions that are excludable from an Employees gross income pursuant to Code §125 or §132(f)(4), and 
 


 
(F)
Amounts contributed as salary deferrals to the NQ Plan or the Restorative Plan.  2. The following Section 1.38 shall be added to the Plan, and the current Section 1.38 and subsequent sections shall be renumbered accordingly, effective as of January 1, 2012. 
1.38 Restorative Plan

3. Sections 3.1(b)(i) through 3.1(b)(iii) of the Plan shall be replaced in their entirety with the following, effective as of January 1, 2012.
  


 
(i)
Standard Match. As of the last day of the Plan Year, the Committee shall make the final allocation of Company Matching Contributions (including such forfeitures
occurring during the Plan Year that are treated as Company Matching Contributions pursuant to subsection 5.4(d)) to each Participant who made Participant Contributions during the Plan Year as follows. Each Participants allocation shall be
equal to his Participant Contributions for the Plan Year, up to a maximum allocation of 8% of his Compensation. The Committee may make interim allocations of Company Matching Contributions during the Plan Year, reflecting the allocation earned thus
far in the Plan Year.   


 
(ii)
Additional Match. If the nondiscrimination tests described in sections 3.5 and 3.6 are not satisfied for a Plan Year, the Company may elect to contribute an
additional amount, or it may elect to use any forfeitures occurring during the Plan Year, as an extra Company Matching Contribution for the Plan Year. The extra Company Matching Contribution may be designated as a QMAC pursuant to section 3.8 and
allocated as specified in section 3.8. Extra Company Matching Contributions not designated as QMACs shall be allocated in the same fashion as QMACs are allocated in section 3.8. 
 


 
(iii)
Coordination With Code §401(a)(17). Company Matching Contributions in a Plan Year shall accrue only on Participant Contributions up to 8% of the Code
§401(a)(17) limit for that Plan Year. Any Company Matching Contributions allocated during the Plan Year in which they were accrued shall be allocated on a temporary basis only; the allocation shall become final after the Committee verifies that
the allocation complies with the terms of the Plan, including the limits of Code §401(a)(17). Any reduction in the allocation to comply with Code §401(a)(17), adjusted to reflect investment experience, shall be used as specified in
subsection 5.4(d).    Prepared December

 4. Section 3.1(d) of the Plan shall be replaced in its entirety with the following, effective as of
January 1, 2012.   


 
(d)
Contributions Contingent on Deductibility. The Company Contributions for a Plan Year (excluding forfeitures and contributions pursuant to paragraph 3.1(c)(v)
shall not exceed the amount allowable as a deduction for Apaches taxable year ending with or within the Plan Year pursuant to Code §404. The amount allowable as a deduction under Code §404 shall include carry forwards of unused
deductions for prior years. If the Code §404 deduction limit would be exceeded for any Plan Year, the Plan contributions shall be reduced, in the following order, until the Plan contributions equal the Code §404 deduction limit: first, the
Company Matching Contributions for those Highly Compensated Employees who are eligible to participate in either the NQ Plan or the Restorative Plan; second, all but $1 of the Company Discretionary Contributions for those Highly Compensated Employees
who are eligible to participate in either the NQ Plan or the Restorative Plan; third, any remaining Company Matching Contribution; fourth, any remaining Company Discretionary Contributions. Company Contributions other than QNECs, QMACs, and
contributions pursuant to paragraph 3.1(c)(v) shall be paid to the Trustee no later than the due date (including any extensions) for filing the Companys federal income tax return for such year; QNECs and QMACs shall be paid to the Trustee no
later than 12 months after the close of the Plan Year; and contributions subject to paragraph 3.1(c)(v) shall be paid to the Trustee as specified in section 15.4. Company Contributions may be made without regard to current or accumulated earnings
and profits; nevertheless, this Plan is intended to qualify as a profit sharing plan as defined in Code §401(a). The Company may pay any contribution in the form of Company Stock or cash, as the Company determines.
 5. Section 3.2(c)(i) of the Plan shall be replaced in its entirety with the following, effective as of January 1,
2012.   


 
(i)
Authorization. An individual who has become, or who is expected to shortly become, a Covered Employee may make an affirmative election to make have amounts
withheld from his Compensation and to have such Participant Contributions contributed to this Plan; such Participant Contributions shall begin as soon as administratively practicable after the Participant has satisfied the waiting period described
in subsection 2.1(a). In addition, an individual who becomes a Covered Employee shall be automatically enrolled in the Plan, and will make Participant Contributions at 8% of his Compensation, unless he affirmatively elects otherwise; the Participant
shall be provided with a reasonable opportunity of at least 30 days to select a different rate of Participant Contribution; the Participant shall be notified in a sufficiently accurate and comprehensive manner that apprises the Participant of his
rights and obligations, written in a manner calculated to be understood by the Participant, that explains his right to elect a contribution percentage rate that is not 8% of Compensation (and that may be 0%), that explains when such automatic
contributions will begin (unless he makes an affirmative election otherwise), and that explains how such automatic Participant Contributions and the associated match will be invested. Any authorization or deemed authorization may apply only to
Compensation that is not then currently available to the Participant. Such authorization or deemed authorization shall remain in effect until revoked or changed by the Participant. If an Employee makes a hardship withdrawal from his Participant
Contributions Account under section 6.5, his contribution rate shall be immediately reduced to 0%, and shall remain at 0% for at least 6 months. To be effective, any authorization, change of authorization, or notice of revocation must be filed with
the Committee according to such restrictions and requirements as the Committee prescribes. The Committee shall establish procedures from time to time for Participants to change their contribution elections, which procedures shall be communicated to
Participants. The Committee may establish different procedures for Participant Contributions from different types of Compensation, such as bonuses. A Participant who also participates in the NQ Plan or the Restorative Plan may make a combined
contribution election that applies to both this Plan and the NQ Plan or Restorative Plan; once made, such combined elections are irrevocable for the periods and the compensation described in the elections.

(iii)
Inadequate Paycheck. If the amounts withheld from a Participants paycheck (including, without limitation, loan repayments, Participant Contributions,
taxes, contributions to the NQ Plan or the Restorative Plan, and premium payments for various benefits) are greater than the paycheck, the Committee shall establish the order in which the deductions shall be applied, with the result that 401(k)
Contributions or Catch-Up Contributions may be reduced below what the Participant had elected. The Committees procedures may also automatically increase a Participants 401(k) Contributions or Catch-Up Contributions in subsequent pay
periods to make up for any missed contributions.  7. Section 3.3(b) of the Plan shall be replaced in its entirety with the
following, effective as of January 1, 2012.

contributions under the Plan are expressly conditioned upon their deductibility for federal income tax purposes. The amount that shall be returned shall be the excess of the amount contributed (reduced to reflect any decrease in the net worth of the
appropriate Accounts attributable thereto) over the amount that would have been contributed if there had not been a mistake in determining the deduction. Appropriate reductions shall be made in the Accounts of Participants to reflect the return of
any contributions previously credited to such Accounts. Any contribution conditioned on its deductibility shall be returned within one year after it is disallowed as a deduction.
