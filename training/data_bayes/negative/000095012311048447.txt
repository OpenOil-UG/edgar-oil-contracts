     (b) Initial Reserves. For purpose of this Award, Initial Reserves means
the total Company proved reserve quantities as of December 31, 2010 expressed in BOEs as estimated
by DeGolyer and MacNaughton, independent petroleum engineers and disclosed in the Companys Form
10-K Report for 2010.


     (c) Final Reserves. For purposes of this Award, Final Reserves means the
sum of (i) the total Company proved reserve quantities on the last day of the Performance Period
expressed in BOEs as estimated by DeGolyer and MacNaughton or the Companys then current
independent petroleum engineer, determined using the same price deck as was used by the Company in
calculating the Initial Reserves, plus (ii) the Uneconomic Reserves, plus (iii) the Disposed
Reserves, plus (iv) Total Production. The Uneconomic Reserves are those proved undeveloped
reserves expressed in BOEs which were included in the Initial Reserves, but are not considered
proved undeveloped reserves on the last day of the Performance Period solely because the price deck
used to price oil and natural gas products and/or the prices used to estimate the capital costs
required to develop the proved undeveloped reserves as of the last day of the Performance Period
have changed from those used in the Initial Reserve report such that the extraction of such
otherwise proved reserves is uneconomic (i.e. Uneconomic Reserves cannot be reserves excluded from
the Final Reserves because drilling activity during the period changed the status or evaluation of
the undeveloped reserves, or because the Company no longer holds the acreage or interest, or
because factors other than commodity prices or changes in the estimated capital costs have made the
project uneconomic). The Disposed Reserves are those proved reserves quantities expressed in
BOEs which were sold during the Performance Period as reported as such in the Companys Form 10-K
SFAS 69 disclosures.


8. Committees Reduction of Performance Percentage Points.



     Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, the Committee, in its sole discretion,
by written notice to Holder prior to the Vesting Date, may reduce Holders otherwise earned
Performance Percentage Points by applying a Committee Percentage Point Reduction.


     (a) Performance Percentage Points Reduction. The Committee will make its
determination of the Committee Percentage Point Reduction amount (if any) based on the Committees
subjective evaluation of Company performance with respect to each of the four Additional Committee
Evaluation Factors listed in (b) below, which evaluation will determine the amount of the
Performance Percentage Points reduction for each such Additional Committee Evaluation Factor based
on the Chart below, and the sum of those reductions, but not in excess of the Committee Percentage
Point Reduction Limitation, will be Committee Percentage Point Reduction for the Performance
Period:

     (b) For purposes of this Award, the Additional Committee Evaluation Factors (each
of which may cause a reduction of up to 10 Performance Percentage Points) are:



     (i) the Companys compliance with such corporate governance factors as the
ability to obtain an unqualified auditors opinion on the Companys financial statements
contained in its Form 10-K for 2011, and avoid any financial restatements,



     (ii) the Companys maintenance of a reasonable debt-to-capital and/or
debt-to-cash flow ratio,



     (iii) the Companys record as to health, safety and environmental compliance
and results, and



     (iv) the increase in the net asset value per share of Company stock,
determined after excluding the effects, to the extent reasonably practical, caused by
fluctuations in commodity prices and capital and operating costs or other factors which are
generally not controllable by the Company.


9. Earning Performance Cash.



     (a) Earned Performance Cash. The amount of Earned Performance Cash shall be
equal to the product of (i) the Target Performance Cash, multiplied by (ii) the Performance
Percentage. The Committee will determine, and the Administrator will advise Holder, of Holders
Performance Percentage as soon as reasonably possible after the last day of the Performance Period.


     (b) Change in Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing and any other
provision hereof to the contrary, if a Change in Control occurs during the Performance Period then,
regardless of the Performance Percentage at the date of the Change in Control, Holder will be
entitled to receive delivery of all of the Target Performance Cash (notwithstanding any provision
hereof to the contrary, none of which Target Performance Cash will be retained by the Company other
than as payment for withholding) as soon as reasonably possible following such Change in Control,
but in no event later than the 15th day of the third month after the end of the calendar year in
which such Change in Control occurs, and Holder permanently shall forfeit the right to receive any
other amounts of Performance Cash.

other amounts of Performance Cash) as soon as reasonably possible but in no event more than
90 days after Holders death.



     (ii) Disability. If Holder Separates by reason of a Disability
prior to the Vesting Date, Holder will be entitled to receive Performance Cash in an amount
equal to the Target Performance Cash (and does not have any right to receive any additional

15th day of the third month after the end of the calendar year following the Date on which
the Committee determines that Holder is Disabled.



     (iii) Post Separation Change in Control. If there is a Post
Separation Change in Control, Holder will be entitled to receive Performance Cash in an
amount equal to the Target Performance Cash (and does not have any right to receive any
additional Performance Cash) as soon as reasonably possible after the date of the Change in
Control but in no event later than the 15th day of the third month after the end of the
calendar year in which such Change in Control occurs.

Retirement Vesting Date and prior to the Vesting Date, Holder will be entitled to receive
only that percentage (if any) of the Performance Cash as shall be determined by the
Committee in writing (and does not have any right to receive any additional amounts of
Performance Cash). In making its determination, the Committee will take into account the
percentage of the Performance Period completed by the date of Holders Separation, and its
best estimate of the Performance Percentage Points Holder has earned by the date of
Holders Separation and is expected to earn during the portion of the Performance Period
occurring after the date of Holders Separation. The Committee will make its
determination, and Holder will receive the Performance Cash (if any) as determined by the

month after the end of the calendar year following Holders Separation.

interpret conclusively the provisions of the Award, adopt such rules and regulations for carrying
out the Award as it may deem advisable, decide conclusively all questions of fact arising in the
application of the Award, certify the extent to which Performance Measures have been satisfied and

desirable for the administration of the Award. The Committee is authorized to change any of the
terms or conditions of the Award in order to take into account any material unanticipated change in
the Companys operations, corporate structure, assets, or similar change, but only to the extent
such action carries out the original purpose, intent and objectives of the Award. All decisions
and acts of the Committee shall be final and binding upon Holder and all other affected parties.

lives, only Holder or his or her guardian or legal representative shall have the right to receive
and retain Vested Earned Shares.

confer upon Holder any right to continue to serve in the employ of the Company nor interfere in any

valid unless it is in writing and signed by the party waiving the right. Any such waiver shall not
be deemed to be a waiver of any other rights.

illegal, unenforceable or void, in whole or in part, the remainder of this Award will not be
affected by such declaration or finding and each such provision not so affected will be enforced to
