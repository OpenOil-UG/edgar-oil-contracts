Any individuals employed by WPX or its Affiliates and performing Services hereunder shall be and remain the employees of WPX and/or its Affiliates (and not of Company).  Company shall be free at any time to accept, reject or, upon reasonable notice, ask for replacements for any such personnel.

Such obligations apply whether the discontinuance of use occurs upon the termination of this Agreement or prior thereto.4.COMPENSATION:As full and complete compensation for Services, Company agrees to pay WPX the following fees:(a)Allocation of Cost Centers.(i)Allocation of Cost Centers - Modified Massachusetts Formula.The fee for certain services (the “MMF Allocated Services”) will be derived by allocating a percentage of the cost centers under which WPX provides such services using the Modified Massachusetts Formula (the “MMF”).  The MMF is a three-factor formula, which allocates costs to subsidiaries, divisions or business units giving equal weight to operating revenue less cost-of-sales, gross payroll and gross property, plant and equipment.  For purposes of this calculation, revenues will be reported net of royalties.  For purposes7 of the MMF calculation, gross payroll shall include total wages, salaries and other compensation, such as would be reportable on IRS form 941 or the Argentine equivalent.  In the event of changes due to acquisitions, mergers or asset sales, this allocation will be adjusted quarterly.The MMF Allocated Services are listed on Exhibit A.  WPX's cost centers to which the MMF applies will be analyzed at least annually by both WPX and Apco to determine whether the list of cost centers on Exhibit A is complete and appropriate.  The Parties may update the list of cost centers on Exhibit A without amending this Agreement.(ii)Allocation of Cost Centers - Employee Ratio Formula.The fee for certain services (the “Employee Ratio Allocated Services”) will be derived by allocating a percentage of the cost centers under which WPX provides such services, such percentage being equal to the number that yields from dividing the number of Apco-Focused Employees listed on Exhibit C by the total number of WPX employees (the “Employee Ratio Formula”).  The Employee Ratio Formula Services are listed on Exhibit B.  WPX's cost centers to which the Employee Ratio Formula applies will be analyzed at least annually by both WPX and Apco to determine whether the list of cost centers on Exhibit B is complete and appropriate.  The Parties may update the list of cost centers on Exhibit B without amending this Agreement.(iii)Allocation of Cost Centers - RevisionsIn the event WPX wishes to adopt a different method for the allocation of corporate expenses to the Company or other of its Affiliates in the future, WPX and the Company shall meet to determine whether the new allocation method will be used hereunder or whether the Parties shall continue the use of the MMF allocation method or the Employee Ratio Formula allocation method.  Should the Parties determine to use a different allocation method, their agreement to do so shall be reflected in an amendment to this Agreement.  In the event the Parties determine to continue the use of the MMF allocation method or the Employee Ratio Formula allocation method, no amendment to this Agreement shall be required.(b)Apco-Focused Employees.  WPX shall provide the Company with the services of those positions set forth on Exhibit C that perform specific functions for the Company and spend either substantial time in the performance of services for the Company or consistently provide time to the Company every month.  The fee for these services will be derived by (i) allocating the percentage of salary and bonus for each position listed in Exhibit C, and (ii) adding 33% of the cost of the employee benefits and taxes attributable to such position. (c)The percentages and positions shall be reviewed by the parties periodically and adjusted but not more than on an annual basis.  The Parties may update the percentages and positions on Exhibit C without amending this Agreement. (d)Flat Management Fee.  The Company will also pay WPX $150,000 per year for the services of those WPX employees or employees of its Affiliates that hold the positions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Apco as compensation for time devoted by those employees in the performance of their duties for the Company.  Such amount was determined by using an estimate of the time actually spent by such employees on behalf of Apco and will be periodically reviewed and adjusted by the Parties as appropriate to8 more accurately reflect the actual time spent.  An adjustment to such fee will require an amendment to this Agreement. (e)Flat Legal Fee.  The Company shall pay WPX $100,000 per yet for legal services.  The parties shall periodically review such amount and adjust as appropriate.  An adjustment to such fee will require an amendment to this Agreement. (f)Rent.  The Company shall pay WPX for use of office spaced by the Apco-focused employees.  The amount of such rent will be derived by multiplying the 3,450 square feet occupied by the Apco-focused employees on the 35th floor of One Williams Center, Tulsa, Oklahoma, by (i) the rent charge per square foot (which includes operating costs) that is listed on Exhibit D, and (ii) the average salary allocation listed on Exhibit C. (g)Pass-Through Costs.  The Company shall pay WPX separately for Services that are not included above and are directly identifiable to the Company on an as-used basis.  Such Services include but are not limited to Sarbanes Oxley support services, travel services, telephone, and printing and reproduction services and supplies.  These services will be charged to the Company on the same rate as charged to other WPX Affiliates or Subsidiaries.  The Company shall also reimburse WPX for the cost of any insurance coverage provided to Apco by WPX. 5.INVOICING AND PAYMENTS:WPX shall at a minimum submit quarterly invoices to Company for Services rendered hereunder and will provide full supporting documentation upon the request of Company.  Company shall pay WPX the amounts of such invoices within thirty (30) days after receipt; provided, that if Company shall have any objection to all or any portion of an invoice, Company shall notify WPX of the same within thirty (30) days after receipt of the invoice, give reasons for its objection and pay only the portion of the invoice which is not in dispute.  Representatives of WPX and Company shall confer within sixty (60) days of receipt of objection by Company regarding a particular invoice to resolve any disputed invoices.  In the event such representatives are unable to reach agreement with regard to such a dispute, the matter shall be resolved in accordance with Section 23.6.RIGHT TO AUDIT:WPX shall keep such books and records (which books and records shall be maintained on a consistent basis and substantially in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles) as shall readily disclose, as allowed by law, the basis for any charges or credits, ordinary or extraordinary, billed to Company under this Agreement.  Company shall, as allowed by law, have the right, upon reasonable notice from Company to WPX and during regular business hours, to inspect, examine and audit or cause to be audited each year the accounts and records of WPX reasonably related to the Services provided hereunder, except where such accounts and records would otherwise be considered proprietary or confidential, in which case such audit shall be conducted by an independent auditor agreed to by the Parties, provided such right is exercised in a manner that does not interfere with the provision of the Services hereunder by WPX.  Any audit by Company hereunder shall be at Company's sole cost and expense. 97.INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR STATUS:(a)WPX hereby declares it is engaged in an independent business and agrees to perform the Services as an independent contractor with, except as otherwise provided for hereunder, full responsibility for the control and direction of its employees and subcontractors.  WPX, in its performance of this Agreement, has and hereby retains the right to exercise full control and supervision over the accomplishment of the objectives set forth herein; provided, however, that Company shall be free at any time to accept, reject or request replacement of any WPX personnel providing the Services.  WPX shall make reasonable efforts to complete the Services in a timely manner.  WPX shall not be required to provide personnel to work a specific number of hours per day or specific days of the week.  WPX shall not be an agent, employee or servant for and may not bind Company.

Nor shall any WPX employees be entitled to any direct or indirect compensation or remuneration of any kind from Company as a result of the Services performed under this Agreement.8.INDEMNIFICATION:(a)WPX shall be responsible for and shall defend and hold harmless Company from and against all claims, demands, causes of action, liabilities, fines, penalties, loss, or expense (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and expenses) (collectively “Claims”) of every kind and character, whether they be direct or indirect, arising from or related to, actions and/or omissions of any kind from personnel providing Services to Company hereunder when not performing tasks or assignments for or on behalf of Company.

The arbitration shall be the sole and exclusive forum for resolution of the dispute, controversy or claim, and the award shall be final and binding.  Judgment thereon may be entered by any court having jurisdiction.  The number of arbitrators shall be three, each of whom shall be disinterested in the dispute, controversy or claim and shall have no connection with either Party.

The Parties shall have thirty (30) days to each appoint an arbitrator.  If, after such 30-day period, the Parties have not made such appointment, the appointing authority shall select all three arbitrators.

The arbitrators shall apply the laws of the State of Oklahoma without regard to the principles of conflicts of laws.(ii)In the event that there is an existing arbitration pursuant to paragraph (i) above, and that the same or a similar dispute, controversy or claim should arise between Persons other than the parties to the existing arbitration, the arbitrators shall have the power to allow the other16 Persons to be joined in the existing arbitration with their express consent, and to make a single final award determining all disputes, controversies or claims among them.(iii)Each Party hereby submits to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma in any action, suit or proceeding with respect to the enforcement of the arbitration provisions of this Agreement and the jurisdiction of such court with respect to the enforcement of any award thereunder.(iv)The compensation and expenses of the arbitrators shall be borne equally by the Parties.  Each Party shall bear its own costs, expenses and attorneys' fees, provided that, if court proceedings to stay litigation or compel arbitration are necessary, the Party who unsuccessfully opposes such proceedings shall pay all reasonable associated costs, expenses, and attorneys' fees in connection with such court proceedings.(b)Waiver of Immunity.  Each Party hereby irrevocably consents to and waives any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any proceeding relating to enforcement of the arbitration provisions, or any award thereunder brought in the courts specified, and further irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any such proceeding in such courts.(c)Judgment Currency.  The obligation of a Party in respect of any sum due from it to another Party expressed in United States Dollars, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than United States Dollars, shall not be discharged until the first Business Day following receipt by such other Party of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other currency on which (and only to the extent that) such other Party may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase United States Dollars with such other currency.  If the Dollars so purchased are less than the sum originally due to such other Party hereunder, the obligated Party agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such other Party against such Dollar shortfall.  If the United States Dollars so purchased are greater than the sum originally due to such other Party hereunder, such other Party agrees to the fullest extent permitted by law to pay to the obligated Party an amount equal to the excess of the Dollars so purchased over the sum originally due to such other Party hereunder24.MUTUAL COOPERATION:Company and WPX will provide each other with such assistance as may reasonably be required by any of them in connection with the performance of all obligations under this Agreement.25.FORCE MAJEURE:Neither party hereto shall be liable in any manner for failure or delay of performance of all or part of this Agreement (other than payment obligations), directly or indirectly, owing to any acts of God, governmental orders or restrictions, strikes or other labor disturbances, riots, embargoes, computer equipment failures, power failures, telecommunication line failures, revolutions, wars (declared or undeclared), sabotage, fires, floods, or any other causes or circumstances beyond the control of the parties.
