Operator or the Company), and R. A. Walker (the Passenger).  RECITALS  WHEREAS, Operator owns and/or operates the
aircraft (individually and/or collectively, as the case may be, the Aircraft) listed on Schedule A hereto for business use by employees and non-employee directors of the Company in accordance with 14 C.F.R.
Part 91of the Federal Aviation Regulations (as found at 14 C.F.R. Parts 1-199 generally, the FAR) and the Companys Corporate Aircraft Policy regarding the use of corporate aircraft (the Aircraft
Policy); and  WHEREAS, Operator has the right and lawful authority to enter into time sharing
agreements, as provided in §91.501 of the FAR to provide its senior executives with personal travel consistent with the Companys Aircraft Policy; and 
WHEREAS, Operator has agreed to make the Aircraft, with flight crew, when the Aircraft and flight crew are not otherwise
needed for business purposes, available to Passenger for Passengers personal travel in accordance with the Aircraft Policy on a non-exclusive time-sharing basis in accordance with §91.501 of the FAR; and 
WHEREAS, the Passenger agrees to reimburse the Operator for the personal use of the Aircraft for certain flights as
permitted under the FAR and as pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, which sets forth the understanding of the parties.  NOW THEREFORE, Operator and Passenger declaring their intention to enter into and be bound by this Agreement, and for the good and valuable consideration set forth below, hereby covenant and agree as
follows:  NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows: 
1.        Provision of Aircraft and Crew.  Subject to
Aircraft availability, Operator agrees to provide to Passenger the Aircraft and flight crew on a time sharing basis in accordance with the provisions of FAR Part 91, including §§ 91.501(b)(6), 91.501(c)(1) and 91.501(d) of the FAR.
Operator shall provide, at its sole expense, qualified flight crew for all flight operations under this Agreement. If Operator is no longer the operator of any of the Aircraft, Schedule A shall be deemed amended to delete any reference
to such Aircraft and this Agreement shall be terminated as to such Aircraft but shall remain in full force and effect with respect to each of the other Aircraft identified thereon, if any. No such termination shall affect any of the rights and
obligations of the parties accrued or incurred prior to such termination. If Operator becomes the operator of any aircraft not listed on Schedule A hereto, Schedule A shall be modified to include such aircraft as an Aircraft
covered by this Agreement, and thereafter this Agreement shall

remain in full force and effect with respect to such Aircraft and each of the other Aircraft identified thereon, if any. 
2.        Term.  The term of this Agreement (the
Term) shall commence on the date hereof and shall continue until terminated by either party on written notice to the other party, such termination to become effective 30 days from the date of the notice; provided,
however, that this Agreement may be terminated by Operator on such shorter notice as may be required for Operator to comply with applicable law, regulations, the requirements of any financial institution with a security or other interest in the
Aircraft, insurance requirements, or in the event the insurance required hereunder is not in full force and effect. This Agreement shall be terminated immediately upon the termination of Passengers employment with Operator. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any provisions directly or indirectly related to Passengers payment obligations for flights completed prior to the date of termination and the limitation of liability provisions in Section 10 shall survive the
termination of this Agreement.  Reimbursement of Expenses.  For each Trip or Round Trip (as such terms
are defined below) conducted under this Agreement, Passenger shall pay Operator an amount (as determined by Operator) equal to the actual expenses of operating such Trip, not to exceed the sum of the following expenses as permitted pursuant to FAR

travel under this Agreement shall be in accordance with all reasonable policies established by Operator. Flight requests shall be made by Passenger in a form that is acceptable to Operator. Operator shall have sole and exclusive authority over the
scheduling of the Aircraft. Operator shall not be liable to Passenger or any other person for loss, injury, or damage occasioned by the delay or failure to furnish the Aircraft and crew pursuant to this Agreement for any reason. In addition to

 5.        Operational
Authority and Control.   


 
a.
 Operator shall be responsible for the physical and technical operation of the Aircraft and the safe performance of all flights under
this Agreement, and shall retain full authority and control, including exclusive operational control and exclusive possession, command and control of the Aircraft for all flights under this Agreement. 
 


 
b.
 Operator shall furnish at its expense a fully qualified flight crew with appropriate credentials to conduct each flight undertaken
under this Agreement and included on the insurance policies that Operator is required to maintain hereunder. In accordance with applicable FAR, the qualified flight crew provided by Operator will exercise all required and/or appropriate duties and
responsibilities in regard to the safety of each flight conducted hereunder. The pilot-in-command shall have absolute discretion in all matters concerning the preparation of the Aircraft for flight and the flight itself, the load carried and its
distribution, the decision whether or not a flight shall be undertaken, the route to be flown, the place where landings shall be made, and all other matters relating to operation of the Aircraft. Passenger specifically agrees that the flight crew
shall have final and complete authority to delay or cancel any flight for any reason or condition that in the sole judgment of the pilot-in-command could compromise the safety of the flight, and to take any other action that in the sole judgment of
the pilot-in-command is necessitated by considerations of safety. No such action of the pilot-in-command shall create or support any liability to Passenger or any other person for loss, injury, damage or delay. Operators operation of the
Aircraft hereunder shall be strictly within the guidelines and policies established by Operator and FAR Part 91.   


 
c.
 Subject to Aircraft and crew availability, Operator shall use its good faith efforts, consistent with its approved policies, to
accommodate Passengers needs and avoid conflicts in scheduling. Although every good faith effort shall be made to avoid its occurrence, any flights scheduled under this Agreement are subject to cancellation by either party without incurring
liability to the other party. In the event of a cancellation, the canceling party shall provide the maximum notice reasonably practicable.   


 
d.
 In the absence of another flight scheduled on the aircraft by Passenger or another scheduled business trip, the Aircraft may remain at
the destination until its next required use. If the next use of the Aircraft is a business use, Operator shall not charge the Passenger for expenses associated with hangar and tie-down costs away from the Aircrafts base of operation; if,
however, the next use of the Aircraft is by Passenger, Operator shall have the option of returning the Aircraft to its base of operations or permitting it 
  







Anadarko Aircraft Time Sharing Agreement  R. A. Walker
  
Page 4








 
 
to remain at the destination. In either event, Passenger shall pay for the associated costs. 
6.        Aircraft Maintenance. Operator shall, at its own
expense, cause the Aircraft to be inspected, maintained, serviced, repaired, overhauled, and tested in accordance with FAR Part 91 so that the Aircraft will remain in good operating condition and in a condition consistent with its airworthiness
certification and shall take such requirements into account in scheduling the Aircraft hereunder, including but not limited compliance with applicable airworthiness directives and service bulletins. Performance of maintenance, preventive maintenance
or inspection shall not be delayed or postponed for the purpose of scheduling the Aircraft unless such maintenance or inspection can safely be conducted at a later time in compliance with applicable laws, regulations and requirements, and such delay
or postponement is consistent with the sound discretion of the pilot-in-command. In the event that any non-standard maintenance is required during the term and will interfere with Passengers requested or scheduled flights, Operator, or
Operators pilot-in-command, shall notify Passenger of the maintenance required, the effect on the ability to comply with Passengers requested or scheduled flights and the manner in which the parties will proceed with the performance of
such maintenance and conduct of such flight(s). In no event shall Operator be liable to Passenger or any other person for loss, injury or damage occasioned by the delay or failure to furnish the Aircraft under this Agreement, whether or not
maintenance-related.  7.        Insurance. 
 


 
a.
 Operator, at its expense, will maintain or cause to be maintained in full force and effect throughout the Term of this Agreement an
aviation liability and hull insurance policy including: aviation liability insurance against bodily injury and property damage claims arising out of the use of the Aircraft in an amount not less than $250 Million for each occurrence; and hull
insurance for the Aircraft in amounts determined by Operator at its sole discretion. The aviation liability coverage shall include Passenger as an insured, and include a severability of interest provision providing that the insurance shall apply
separately to each insured against whom a claim is made, except as respects the limits of liability. The aviation liability and hull insurance coverage shall include provisions whereby the insurer(s) waive all rights of subrogation they may have or
acquire against Passenger and shall permit the use of the Aircraft by Operator for compensation or hire as provided in §91.501 of the FAR.   


 
b.
 Operator shall use reasonable commercial efforts to provide such additional insurance for specific flights under this Agreement as
Passenger may reasonably request. Passenger acknowledges that any trips scheduled to areas not currently covered by existing policies may require Operator to purchase additional insurance to comply with applicable regulations, and Operator shall be
required to maintain or cause to be maintained such additional insurance. The cost of all flight-specific insurance shall be borne by Passenger as provided in Section 2(d) above.

 8.        Use of
Aircraft. Passenger warrants that:   


 
a.
 Passenger has all necessary powers to enter into the transactions contemplated in this Agreement and has taken actions required to
authorize and approve this Agreement;   


 
b.
 Passenger will use the Aircraft under this Agreement for and only for its own account, including the carriage of its guests, and will
not use the Aircraft for the purpose of providing transportation of passengers or cargo for compensation or hire or for common carriage;   


 
c.
 Passenger will not permit any lien, security interest or other charge or encumbrance to attach against the Aircraft as a result of his
actions or inactions, and shall not attempt to convey, mortgage, assign, lease or in any way alienate the Aircraft or Operators rights hereunder or create any kind of lien or security interest involving the Aircraft or do anything or take any
action that might mature into such a lien;   


 
d.
 During the Term of this Agreement, Passenger will abide by and conform to all such laws, governmental and airport orders, rules, and
regulations as shall from time to time be in effect relating in any way to the operation or use of the Aircraft by a lessee under a time sharing arrangement and all applicable policies of Operator; and 
 


 
e.
 Passenger acknowledges that its discretion in determining the origin and destination of flights under this Agreement shall be subject
to the following: such origin and destination, and the routes to reach such origin and destination, are not within or over (i) an area of hostilities, (ii) an area excluded from coverage under the insurance policies maintained by Operator
with respect to the Aircraft, or (iii) a country or jurisdiction for which exports or transactions are subject to specific restrictions under any United States export or other law or United Nations Security Council Directive, including without
