(c)                                  in the event the Parties are unable to resolve their dispute through mediation pursuant to Section 11.2(b), within thirty (30) days from the failure to reach a satisfactory resolution pursuant to Section 11.2(a), such dispute shall be settled exclusively and finally by arbitration under the Arbitration Rules of the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA) current at the time when the arbitration proceedings are commenced, which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this Article XI.  There shall be three (3) arbitrators, one nominated by the claimant Party, one nominated by the respondent Party within fourteen (14) days of the claimant Partys nomination, and one nominated by the two Party-nominated arbitrators.  If the two arbitrators fail to agree on the nomination of the third arbitrator within ten (10) days of the nomination of the respondent Partys arbitrator, the LCIA Court shall make such appointment only.  The inclusion of such nomination mechanism shall not exclude the powers of the LCIA Court under Article 9 of the LCIA Rules.  Article 13.1 of the LCIA Rules shall be disapplied to the extent that each Party may communicate (without copy to any other Party) with its nominated arbitrator regarding the nomination of the chairman only, up until such time as agreement is reached on the nomination of the chairman.  The seat and place of the arbitration shall be London, England.  The language to be used in the arbitration shall be English.  All arbitration notices and requests for arbitration shall be deemed properly given if sent in accordance with Section 15.1.

11.4                        Reference to specific articles of the LCIA Rules in this clause are references to the 1998 edition of such rules  should a subsequent edition of such rules be in force at the time any arbitration is commenced hereunder, then the references to specific articles should be updated mutatis mutandis to achieve the same result.

liabilities contractually assumed by Contractor under this Drilling Contract.  The naming of the members of Operator Group as additional insureds is not intended to, and shall not derogate from, the indemnities, obligations, and allocation of risks and liabilities contained in Article VIII, Section 13.4, and Section 17.2 of the Drilling Contract.  Operator agrees that the Operator Group shall not be entitled to assert a claim against Contractors insurance coverages required herein with respect to the indemnities and liabilities contractually assumed by Operator under the Drilling Contract.  In addition, said insurances (other than the Workers Compensation Insurance) shall be written to provide that claims in rem shall be treated as claims in personam and to provide coverage for any of the insureds in the same manner as would have been provided such insured if separate policies had been issued in the name of each insured thereunder.
 
Except as specifically stated to the contrary herein, any and all deductibles, self-insured retentions, retrospective premiums and loss-sensitive premiums in the above described insurance policies shall be assumed by, for the account of and at Contractors sole risk.
 
All policies providing coverage hereunder shall contain provisions that no cancellation or material changes in the policies shall become effective except on thirty (30) days written notice thereof to Operator (seven (7) days for cancellation due to war risk).
 
When requested by Operator, Contractor shall furnish, or cause to be furnished, to Operator, in the manner above provided, certificates of insurance evidencing coverage for each subcontractor in minimum amounts deemed necessary by Contractor to cover the Work performed by the particular subcontractor.  Should insurance coverage maintained by a subcontractor be less than the minimum requirements for Contractor, as set out above, Operator may, at its option (1) require Contractor, or require Contractor to cause any subcontractor of Contractor, to secure such minimum coverage, or (2) upon ten (10) days prior written notice to Contractor purchase insurance necessary to provide such minimum coverage and charge the premiums therefor (not to exceed $2,500 per day) to Contractors account.
 
In the event that Contractors minimum insurance coverages, as required by Part A of Appendix E (except for the insurance coverages described at Part A(4)(B) and Part A(7), which for the purposes of this paragraph only, such minimum amount of the combined coverages shall be Five Hundred Million U.S. Dollars (US $500,000,000.00)), is not provided or should be canceled, or materially modified or changed in breach of the Drilling Contract, Operator may, at its sole discretion, suspend the Work until such minimum insurance coverage is provided or reinstated.  The Zero Rate shall be applicable during any such suspension.  If Contractor fails to provide or maintain the minimum insurance coverages required hereunder, and Operator so notifies Contractor in writing, Contractor shall have ten (10) business days from the date of such notice to provide or maintain the minimum insurance coverage required by Part A of Appendix E.  In the event Contractor fails to provide or maintain such minimum insurance coverage within

Best rating of A- or better and who are authorized to do business in the geographical area where the Work is to be performed.  Operators insurance policies are confidential information within the meaning of, and subject to, Article XVII of the Drilling Contract.  The types and amounts of insurance (through insurance, including self-insured retentions and/or deductibles in reasonable amounts consistent with customary industry practice) set forth in this Appendix E, Part B are the minimum types and amounts that Operator must obtain and maintain during the term of this Drilling Contract.
 
If insurance is provided on a claims made basis, coverage in each case shall provide for and maintain a retrospective date prior to or concurrent with the commencement of the Work and an automatic extended reporting period of no less than ninety (90) days.  Such claims-made coverage shall be maintained continuously, on substantially the same material terms to the extent reasonably commercially available, for a period of at least five (5) years following completion of the Work, through extension or renewal of such coverage or through the purchase, at Operators sole expense, of an additional extended reporting period and/or run-off or tail coverage acceptable to Contractor.  In the event Operator is notified of any intention of the issuer or underwriter of any such claims-made coverage not to renew such coverage during the period required by this Drilling Contract, Operator shall notify Contractor within thirty (30) days.
 
The types and limits of insurance coverage specified below are minimum requirements and shall not be deemed to constitute, or be construed as, a limitation on Operators liabilities under this Drilling Contract or as constituting acceptance by Contractor of any responsibility for financial or other liabilities or indemnities in excess of such limits.
 
1.                                      Workers Compensation and Employers Liability Insurance in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and maritime laws (including Death on the High Seas Act, HSL&H and Jones Act) which shall cover all Operators personnel, invitees, subcontractors, guests, consultants, etc., performing under this Drilling Contract.  The Employers Liability Employers Liability Insurance shall include coverage for bodily injury by accident with limits of not less than One Million U.S. Dollars (US $1,000,000.00) per each accident, and bodily injury by disease with policy limits of not less than One Million U.S. Dollars (US $1,000,000.00) per each

(B)                                        No later than seven (7) days after the date hereof, the Transferor, Rowan (UK) Reliance Limited, a company incorporated under the laws of England (registration number 8592391) (herein called the Transferee, and together with the Transferor, Contractor), and Operator shall execute and deliver a deed of partial novation, to be effective as of the date of the Rigs arrival in the Area of Operations (the Novation), assigning and transferring the specified Transferors rights, obligations and liabilities under the Drilling Contract in respect of the Work to be performed in the Area of Operations to the Transferee.  Upon any commencement of mobilisation to an area outside the Area of Operations during the term of the Drilling Contract, the specified rights, obligations and liabilities under the Drilling Contract will revert to the Transferor in the manner set out in the Novation.
 
(C)                                        The Guarantor has agreed to enter into this Guarantee with Operator to guarantee the performance of all present and future obligations and liabilities of Contractor due, owing or incurred under the Drilling Contract or any document referred to in it (including under any amendment, supplement or restatement thereof) (the Guaranteed Obligations).

(e)                         anything done or omitted by any Person which, but for this provision, might operate to exonerate or discharge the Guarantor or otherwise reduce or extinguish its liability under this Guarantee.

B.                                    After 180 Days of Deployment
 
Except for any loss or destruction of, or damage to, a BOP which is governed by Section 8.4(b)(ii) or Section 8.4(d), if a BOP is subject to BOP Unavailability, and such BOP has been deployed below the water line for more than one hundred and eighty (180) consecutive days, then Contractor shall be entitled to a day rate of ninety percent (90%) of the Standby Rate for the period from the time at which the Work is stopped hereunder in preparation to pull and retrieve the BOP, including the time needed to secure any Designated Well in progress, until the time that the second BOP is deployed and the point where such Work or drilling was stopped is reached again and operations resumed, and the Work shall resume at the Operating Rate up to a maximum of thirty (30) days of BOP Unavailability, after which the Standby Rate shall apply until the first BOP is restored to a fully operational and Compliant condition.
