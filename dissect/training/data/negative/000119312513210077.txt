the requirements of Section 2.05.  If no election as to the Type of Borrowing is specified, then the requested Borrowing shall be an ABR
Borrowing. If no Interest Period is specified with respect to any requested Eurodollar Borrowing, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one months duration. Each Borrowing Request shall constitute a
representation that the amount of the requested Borrowing shall not cause the total Revolving Credit Exposures to exceed the total Commitments (i.e., the lesser of the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts and the then effective Borrowing Base).
 Promptly following receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with this Section 2.03, the Administrative Agent shall advise each
Lender of the details thereof and of the amount of such Lenders Loan to be made as part of the requested Borrowing. 
   26 






 Section 2.04 Interest Elections. 
(a) Conversion and Continuance. Each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and,
in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a
Eurodollar Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section 2.04. The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be
allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.  (b) Interest Election Requests. To make an election pursuant to this Section 2.04, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone, fax (or transmit by
electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the Administrative Agent) by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting
from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest
Election Request in substantially the form of Exhibit C and signed by the Borrower.  (c) Information in Interest Election
Requests. Each telephonic, fax, other approved electronic transmission and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information:  (i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each
resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(iii) and (iv) shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing); 
(ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
 (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing; and 
(iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving
effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term Interest Period.  If any such Interest
Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one months duration. 
   27 






 (d) Notice to Lenders by the Administrative Agent. Promptly following receipt of an
Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lenders portion of each resulting Borrowing.  (e) Effect of Failure to Deliver Timely Interest Election Request and Events of Default and Borrowing Base Deficiencies on Interest Election. If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest
Election Request with respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an
ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default or a Borrowing Base Deficiency has occurred and is continuing: (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or, at the end of its applicable Interest
Period, continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing (and any Interest Election Request that requests such conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective) and (ii) unless repaid, each
Eurodollar Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto. 
Section 2.05 Funding of Borrowings.  (a) Funding by Lenders. Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 1:00 p.m., New York City time, to
the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds,
to an account of the Borrower designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request; provided that ABR Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.08(e) shall be remitted by the
Administrative Agent to the Issuing Bank. Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for its Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain
the funds for its Loan in any particular place or manner.  (b) Presumption of Funding by the Lenders. Unless the
Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may
assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.05(a) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact
made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for
each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate
determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative
Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lenders Loan included in such Borrowing. 
   28 






 Section 2.06 Termination, Reduction and Increase of Aggregate Maximum Credit
Amounts.  (a) Scheduled Termination of Commitments. Unless previously terminated, the Commitments shall terminate
on the Maturity Date. If at any time the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts or the Borrowing Base is terminated or reduced to zero, then the Commitments shall terminate on the effective date of such termination or reduction. 
(b) Optional Termination and Reduction of Aggregate Credit Amounts. 
(i) The Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts;
provided that (A) each reduction of the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $1,000,000 and (B) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Aggregate
Maximum Credit Amounts if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Loans in accordance with Section 3.04(c), the total Revolving Credit Exposures would exceed the total Commitments. 
(ii) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Aggregate Maximum
Credit Amounts under Section 2.06(b)(i) at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the
Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.06(b)(ii) shall be irrevocable. Any termination or reduction of the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts shall
be permanent and may not be reinstated. Each reduction of the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with each Lenders Applicable Percentage. 
(c) Optional Increase in Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts. 
(i) Subject to the conditions set forth in Section 2.06(c)(ii), the Borrower may increase the Aggregate Maximum
Credit Amounts then in effect by increasing the Maximum Credit Amount of a Lender or by causing a Person that at such time is not a Lender (subject to the consent of the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or denied) to become a Lender (an Additional Lender).  (ii) Any
increase in the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts shall be subject to the following additional conditions:  (A) such increase
shall not be less than $10,000,000 unless the Administrative Agent otherwise consents, and no such increase shall be permitted if after giving effect thereto the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts would exceed $500,000,000; 
(B) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the effective date of such increase; 
   29 






 (C) on the effective date of such increase, no Eurodollar Borrowings shall be outstanding
or if any Eurodollar Borrowings are outstanding, then the effective date of such increase shall be the last day of the Interest Period in respect of such Eurodollar Borrowings unless the Borrower pays compensation required by Section 5.02;
 (D) no Lenders Maximum Credit Amount may be increased without the consent of such Lender; 
(E) if the Borrower elects to increase the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amount by increasing the Maximum Credit Amount of a Lender, the
Borrower and such Lender shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit G-1 (a Maximum Credit Amount Increase Certificate), together with a processing and recordation fee
of $5,000, and the Borrower shall deliver a new Note payable to such Lender in a principal amount equal to its Maximum Credit Amount after giving effect to such increase, and otherwise duly completed; and 
(F) If the Borrower elects to increase the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts by causing an Additional Lender to become a party to this
Agreement, then the Borrower and such Additional Lender shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit G-2 (an Additional Lender Certificate), together with an
Administrative Questionnaire and a processing and recordation fee of $5,000, and the Borrower shall deliver a Note payable to such Additional Lender in a principal amount equal to its Maximum Credit Amount, and otherwise duly completed. 
(iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to Section 2.06(c)(iv), from and after the effective date
specified in the Maximum Credit Amount Increase Certificate or the Additional Lender Certificate (or if any Eurodollar Borrowings are outstanding, then the last day of the Interest Period in respect of such Eurodollar Borrowings, unless the Borrower
has paid compensation required by Section 5.02): (A) the amount of the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts shall be increased as set forth therein, and (B) in the case of an Additional Lender Certificate, any Additional Lender party
thereto shall be a party to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. In addition, the Lender or the Additional Lender, as applicable, shall
purchase a pro rata portion of the outstanding Loans (and participation interests in Letters of Credit) of each of the other Lenders (and such Lenders hereby agree to sell and to take all such further action to effectuate such sale) such that each
Lender (including any Additional Lender, if applicable) shall hold its Applicable Percentage of the outstanding Loans (and participation interests) after giving effect to the increase in the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amount. 
(iv) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Maximum Credit Amount Increase Certificate or an Additional Lender Certificate,
executed by the Borrower and the Lender or the Borrower and the Additional Lender party thereto, as applicable, the processing and recording fee referred to in Section 2.06(c)(ii), the Administrative Questionnaire referred to in
Section 2.06(c)(ii), if applicable, and the written consent of the Administrative Agent to such increase required by Section 2.06(c)(i), the 
   30 






 
Administrative Agent shall accept such Maximum Credit Amount Increase Certificate or Additional Lender Certificate and record the information contained therein in the Register required to be
maintained by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 12.04(b)(iv). No increase in the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amount shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this
Section 2.06(c)(iv).  Section 2.07 Borrowing Base. 
(a) Initial Borrowing Base. For the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the first Redetermination Date,
the amount of the Borrowing Base shall be $325,000,000. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrowing Base may be subject to further adjustments from time to time pursuant to Section 2.07(e), Section 2.07(f), Section 8.13(c) or
Section 9.12.  (b) Scheduled and Interim Redeterminations. The Borrowing Base shall be redetermined semi-annually
in accordance with this Section 2.07 (a Scheduled Redetermination), and, subject to Section 2.07(d), such redetermined Borrowing Base shall become effective and applicable to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Bank and the Lenders on April 1st and October 1st of each year, commencing October 1, 2013. In addition, the Borrower may, by notifying the Administrative Agent thereof, and the Administrative Agent may, at the direction of
the Required Lenders, by notifying the Borrower thereof, one time during any calendar year, each elect to cause the Borrowing Base to be redetermined between Scheduled Redeterminations (each redetermination made pursuant to this sentence or the
following sentence, an Interim Redetermination) in accordance with this Section 2.07. The Borrower shall have the right to request Interim Redeterminations in addition to the one otherwise provided in this
Section 2.07(b) upon the proposed acquisition of Proved Developed Producing Reserves (whether by purchase of the actual properties or of the Equity Interests in the Person owning such properties) whose purchase price is greater than 10% of the
Borrowing Base; provided such Interim Redetermination is in accordance with this Section 2.07.  (c) Scheduled
and Interim Redetermination Procedure.  (i) Each Scheduled Redetermination and each Interim Redetermination
shall be effectuated as follows: Upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of (A) the Reserve Report and the certificate required to be delivered by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent, in the case of a Scheduled Redetermination, pursuant
to Section 8.12(a) and (c), and, in the case of an Interim Redetermination, pursuant to Section 8.12(b) and (c), and (B) such other reports, data and supplemental information, including, without limitation, the information provided
pursuant to Section 8.12(c), as may, from time to time, be reasonably requested by the Required Lenders (the Reserve Report, such certificate and such other reports, data and supplemental information being the Engineering
Reports), the Administrative Agent shall evaluate the information contained in the Engineering Reports and shall, in good faith, propose a new Borrowing Base (the Proposed Borrowing Base) based upon such information and
such other information (including, without limitation, the status of title information with respect to the Oil and Gas Properties as described in the Engineering Reports and the 
   31 






 
existence of any other Debt) as the Administrative Agent deems appropriate in its sole discretion and consistent with its normal oil and gas lending criteria as it exists at the particular time.
In no event shall the Proposed Borrowing Base exceed the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts.  (ii) The
Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the Proposed Borrowing Base (the Proposed Borrowing Base Notice):  (A) in the case of a Scheduled Redetermination (1) if the Administrative Agent shall have received the Engineering Reports required to be delivered by the Borrower pursuant to Section 8.12(a)
and (c) in a timely and complete manner, then on or before March 15th and September 15th of such year following the date of delivery or (2) if the Administrative Agent shall not have received the Engineering Reports required to
be delivered by the Borrower pursuant to Section 8.12(a) and (c) in a timely and complete manner, then promptly after the Administrative Agent has received complete Engineering Reports from the Borrower and has had a reasonable opportunity
to determine the Proposed Borrowing Base in accordance with Section 2.07(c)(i); and  (B) in the case of an Interim
Redetermination, promptly, and in any event, within fifteen (15) days after the Administrative Agent has received the required Engineering Reports.  (iii) Any Proposed Borrowing Base that would increase the Borrowing Base then in effect must be approved or deemed to have been approved by all of the Lenders as provided in this
Section 2.07(c)(iii); and any Proposed Borrowing Base that would decrease or maintain the Borrowing Base then in effect must be approved or be deemed to have been approved by the Required Lenders as provided in this Section 2.07(c)(iii).
Upon receipt of the Proposed Borrowing Base Notice, each Lender shall have fifteen (15) days to agree with the Proposed Borrowing Base or disagree with the Proposed Borrowing Base by proposing an alternate Borrowing Base. If at the end of such
fifteen (15) days, any Lender has not communicated its approval or disapproval in writing to the Administrative Agent, such silence shall be deemed to be an approval of the Proposed Borrowing Base. If, at the end of such 15-day period, all of
the Lenders, in the case of a Proposed Borrowing Base that would increase the Borrowing Base then in effect, or the Required Lenders, in the case of a Proposed Borrowing Base that would decrease or maintain the Borrowing Base then in effect, have
approved or been deemed to have approved, as aforesaid, then the Proposed Borrowing Base shall become the new Borrowing Base, effective on the date specified in Section 2.07(d). If, however, at the end of such 15-day period, all of the Lenders
or the Required Lenders, as applicable, have not approved or deemed to have approved, as aforesaid, then the Administrative Agent shall poll the Lenders to ascertain the highest Borrowing Base then acceptable to all of the Lenders (if the Borrowing
Base will be increased) or the Required Lenders (if the Borrowing Base will be decreased), as the case may be, and such amount shall become the new Borrowing Base, effective on the date specified in Section 2.07(d). 
   32 






 (d) Effectiveness of a Redetermined Borrowing Base. After a redetermined Borrowing
Base is approved or is deemed to have been approved by all of the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable, pursuant to Section 2.07(c)(iii), the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the amount of the
redetermined Borrowing Base (the New Borrowing Base Notice), and such amount shall become the new Borrowing Base, effective and applicable to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders: 
(i) in the case of a Scheduled Redetermination, (A) if the Administrative Agent shall have received the Engineering
Reports required to be delivered by the Borrower pursuant to Section 8.12(a) and (c) in a timely and complete manner, then on April 1st or October 1st, as applicable, following such notice, or (B) if the Administrative Agent
shall not have received the Engineering Reports required to be delivered by the Borrower pursuant to Section 8.12(a) and (c) in a timely and complete manner, then on the Business Day next succeeding delivery of such notice; and 
(ii) in the case of an Interim Redetermination, on the Business Day next succeeding delivery of such notice. 
Such amount shall then become the Borrowing Base until the next Scheduled Redetermination Date, the next Interim Redetermination Date or the next
adjustment to the Borrowing Base under Section 2.07(e), Section 2.07(f), Section 8.13(c) or Section 9.12(d), whichever occurs first. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Scheduled Redetermination or Interim Redetermination shall
become effective until the New Borrowing Base Notice related thereto is received by the Borrower.  (e) Reduction of
Borrowing Base Upon Incurrence of Senior Debt. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if the Borrower incurs any Senior Debt, then the Borrowing Base then in effect shall be reduced immediately upon the date of such
incurrence by an amount equal to the product of 0.25 multiplied by an amount equal to the stated principal amount of such Senior Debt. The Borrowing Base as so reduced shall become the new Borrowing Base immediately upon the date of such incurrence,
effective and applicable to the Borrower, the Agents, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders on such date until the next redetermination or modification thereof hereunder. For purposes of this Section 2.07(e), if any such Senior Debt is issued at a
discount or otherwise sold for less than par, the reduction shall be calculated based upon the stated principal amount without reference to such discount.  (f) Reduction of Borrowing Base Related to Swap Agreements. If any Swap Agreement to which the Borrower or any Subsidiary is a party is Liquidated between two successive Scheduled Redetermination
Dates and the Borrowing Base value assigned to the Liquidated portion of such Swap Agreement after giving effect to any other Swap Agreements executed within two Business Days of such Liquidation (as determined by the Administrative Agent), when
combined with the fair market value of the sale or other disposition of Oil and Gas Property or Subsidiary owning Oil and Gas Properties included in the most recently delivered Reserve Report during the period between such successive Scheduled
Redetermination Dates, exceeds ten percent (10%) of the Borrowing Base as then in effect (as determined by the Administrative Agent), individually or in the aggregate, then contemporaneously with such Liquidation, the Borrowing Base then in
effect shall be reduced by an amount equal to the value, if any, assigned to the Liquidated portion of such Swap Agreement in the then effective Borrowing Base, as determined by the Administrative Agent. 
   33 






 Section 2.08 Letters of Credit. 
(a) General. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may request the issuance of dollar denominated
Letters of Credit for its own account or for the account of any of its Subsidiaries, in a form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time during the Availability Period; provided
that the Borrower may not request the issuance, amendment (other than an amendment in respect to the reduction of the outstanding amount of a Letter of Credit or the termination of a Letter of Credit prior to its stated expiration date), renewal or
extension of Letters of Credit hereunder if a Borrowing Base Deficiency exists at such time or would exist as a result thereof. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any
form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the Borrower to, or entered into by the Borrower with, the Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control. 
(b) Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain Conditions. To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the
amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the Issuing Bank) to the Issuing Bank and
the Administrative Agent (not less than five (5) Business Days in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice: 
(i) requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended;
 (ii) specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day);
 (iii) specifying the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with
Section 2.08(c));  (iv) specifying the amount of such Letter of Credit; 
(v) specifying the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to
prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit; and  (vi) specifying the amount of the then effective
Borrowing Base and whether a Borrowing Base Deficiency exists at such time, the current total Revolving Credit Exposures (without regard to the requested Letter of Credit or the requested amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of
Credit) and the pro forma total Revolving Credit Exposures (giving effect to the requested Letter of Credit or the requested amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit). 
   34 






 A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and each notice shall constitute a
representation and warranty by the Borrower that), after giving effect to the requested issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, as applicable, (i) the LC Exposure shall not exceed the LC Commitment and (ii) the total Revolving Credit
Exposures shall not exceed the total Commitments (i.e. the lesser of the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts and the then effective Borrowing Base).  If requested by the Issuing Bank, the Borrower also shall submit a letter of credit application on the Issuing Banks standard form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. 
(c) Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date
one year after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date that is five Business Days prior to the Maturity Date.
 (d) Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount
thereof) and without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such
Lenders Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Bank, such Lenders Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Borrower on the date due as provided in Section 2.08(e), or of any
reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this Section 2.08(d) in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and
unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default, the existence of a Borrowing Base Deficiency or reduction
or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.  (e) Reimbursement. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an
amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date that such LC Disbursement is made, if the Borrower shall have received notice of such LC Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on such
date, or, if such notice has not been received by the Borrower prior to such time on such date, then not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on (i) the Business Day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is received prior
to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the day of receipt, or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt; provided
that if such LC Disbursement is not less than $1,000,000, the Borrower shall, subject to the conditions to Borrowing set forth herein, be deemed to have requested, and the Borrower does hereby request under such circumstances, that such payment be
financed with an ABR Borrowing in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the Borrowers obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Borrowing. If the Borrower fails

   35 






 
to make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such
Lenders Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of the payment then due from the Borrower, in the same manner as provided in
Section 2.05 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.05 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Bank the amounts so
received by it from the Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.08(e), the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Issuing Bank or, to the
extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to this Section 2.08(e) to reimburse the Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and the Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this Section 2.08(e)
to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Loans as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement. 
(f) Obligations Absolute. The Borrowers obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in Section 2.08(e) shall
be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter
of Credit, any Letter of Credit Agreement or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement
therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit or any Letter of Credit
Agreement, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section 2.08(f), constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of
setoff against, the Borrowers obligations hereunder. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor the Issuing Bank, nor any of their Related Parties shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the
issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in
transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising
from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Bank; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims
in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Banks failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents
presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction), the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised all requisite care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented
which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment 
   36 






 
upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such
documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.  (g) Disbursement Procedures. The
Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone
(confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its
obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.  (h) Interim
Interest. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, until the Borrower shall have reimbursed the Issuing Bank for such LC Disbursement (either with its own funds or a Borrowing under Section 2.08(e)), the unpaid amount
thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Loans. Interest accrued
pursuant to this Section 2.08(h) shall be for the account of the Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to Section 2.08(e) to reimburse the Issuing Bank shall be for the account
of such Lender to the extent of such payment.  (i) Replacement of the Issuing Bank. The Issuing Bank may be replaced at
any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of the Issuing Bank. At the time any such
replacement shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 3.05(b). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor
Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term Issuing Bank shall be deemed to refer
to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of the Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and
shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of the Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit. 
(j) Cash Collateralization. If (i) any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing and the Borrower receives notice from
the Administrative Agent or the Majority Lenders demanding that the Borrower cash collateralize the outstanding LC Exposure, (ii) the Borrower is required to cash collateralize the excess attributable to an LC Exposure in connection with any
prepayment pursuant to Section 3.04(c), or (iii) the Borrower is required to cash collateralize a Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure pursuant to Section 4.03(c)(iii)(B), then the Borrower shall pledge and deposit with or deliver to
the Administrative Agent (as a first priority, perfected security interest), for the benefit of the Issuing Bank, at a location and pursuant to documentation in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, an amount in cash in
dollars equal to such LC Exposure or excess attributable to such LC Exposure, 
   37 






 
as the case may be, as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and shall
become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default described in Section 10.01(h) or Section 10.01(i). The Borrower hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the
benefit of the Issuing Bank and the Lenders, an exclusive first priority and continuing perfected security interest in and Lien on such account and all cash, checks, drafts, certificates and instruments, if any, from time to time deposited or held
in such account, all deposits or wire transfers made thereto, any and all investments purchased with funds deposited in such account, all interest, dividends, cash, instruments, financial assets and other Property from time to time received,
receivable or otherwise payable in respect of, or in exchange for, any or all of the foregoing, and all proceeds, products, accessions, rents, profits, income and benefits therefrom, and any substitutions and replacements therefor. The
Borrowers obligation to deposit amounts pursuant to this Section 2.08(j) shall be absolute and unconditional, without regard to whether any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit has attempted to draw down all or a portion of such amount
under the terms of a Letter of Credit, and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, shall not be subject to any defense or be affected by a right of set-off, counterclaim or recoupment which the Borrower or any Subsidiary may now or
hereafter have against any such beneficiary, the Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders or any other Person for any reason whatsoever. Such deposit shall be held as collateral securing the payment and performance of the Borrowers
and the Guarantors obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. The Administrative Agent shall, subject to the terms of the Loan Documents, have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal,
over such account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits of the type described in Sections 9.05(c), 9.05(d), 9.05(e), 9.05(f) and 9.05(g), which investments shall be made at the option of the Administrative Agent and with
the consent of the Borrower, but at the Borrowers risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the
Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the LC Exposure
at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Borrower and the Guarantors under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of
cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default or pursuant to Section 4.03(c)(iii)(B) as a result of a Defaulting Lender, and the Borrower is not otherwise required to cash collateralize the excess attributable
to an LC Exposure in connection with any prepayment pursuant to Section 3.04(c), then such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured
or waived or the events giving rise to such cash collateralization pursuant to Section 4.03(c)(iii)(B) have been satisfied or resolved.  ARTICLE III  PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST; PREPAYMENTS; FEES
 Section 3.01 Repayment of Loans. The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the Administrative
Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Loan on the Termination Date. 
   38 






 Section 3.02 Interest. 
(a) ABR Loans. The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin,
but in no event to exceed the Highest Lawful Rate.  (b) Eurodollar Loans. The Loans comprising each Eurodollar
Borrowing shall bear interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Margin, but in no event to exceed the Highest Lawful Rate. 
(c) Post-Default Rate and Borrowing Base Deficiency Rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, or if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee payable by the Borrower pursuant to Section 3.05 or any Guarantor hereunder or under any other Loan Document is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity,
upon acceleration or otherwise, and including any payments in respect of a Borrowing Base Deficiency under Section 3.04(c), then all Loans outstanding, in the case of an Event of Default, including such overdue amount, in the case of a failure
to pay amounts when due, shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to two percent (2%) plus the respective rates then in effect, but in no event to exceed the Highest Lawful Rate, until such Event of
Default has been cured or such amount is fully paid, as the case may be, and (ii) if a Borrowing Base Deficiency has occurred and has continued unremedied for 45 days, then all Loans outstanding at such time shall bear interest, after as well
as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to two percent (2%) plus the respective rates then in effect, but in no event to exceed the Highest Lawful Rate, until such Borrowing Base Deficiency has been cured; provided that such
Borrowing Base Deficiency rate shall not apply while any default interest rate is in effect pursuant to Section 3.02(c)(i).  (d) Interest Payment Dates. Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and on the Termination Date; provided that (i) interest
accrued pursuant to Section 3.02(c) shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than an optional prepayment of an ABR Loan prior to the Termination Date), accrued interest on the
principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment, and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such
Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.  (e) Interest Rate Computations. All interest hereunder
shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, unless such computation would exceed the Highest Lawful Rate, in which case interest shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), except that interest
computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual
number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate, Adjusted LIBO Rate or LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent
manifest error, and be binding upon the parties hereto. 
   39 






 Section 3.03 Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the commencement of any
Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:  (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive
absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate for such Interest Period; or  (b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Majority Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate or LIBO Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such
Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;  then the Administrative Agent shall give
notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer
exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing for an Interest Period having the duration of such Interest Period shall be ineffective, and
(ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing for an Interest Period having the duration of such Interest Period, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing. 
Section 3.04 Prepayments.  (a) Optional Prepayments. The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part, subject to prior notice in accordance with
Section 3.04(b).  (b) Notice and Terms of Optional Prepayment. The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent
by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment, or (ii) in the case
of prepayment of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, one Business Day before the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing
or portion thereof to be prepaid. Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that
would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02. Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied
by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 3.02 and any payments to the extent required by Section 5.02. 
(c) Mandatory Prepayments.  (i) If, after giving effect to any termination or reduction of the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts pursuant to Section 2.06(b), the total Revolving Credit Exposures exceeds the total Commitments,
then the Borrower shall (A) prepay the Borrowings on the date of such termination or reduction in an aggregate principal amount equal to such excess, and (B) if any excess remains after prepaying all of the Borrowings as a result of an LC
Exposure, cash collateralize such excess as provided in Section 2.08(j). 
   40 






 (ii) Upon any redetermination of or adjustment to the amount of the
Borrowing Base in accordance with Section 2.07 (other than pursuant to Section 2.07(e) or Section 2.07(f)) or Section 8.13(c), if the total Revolving Credit Exposure exceeds the redetermined or adjusted Borrowing Base, then the
Borrower shall (A) prepay the Borrowings in an aggregate principal amount equal to such excess, and (B) if any excess remains after prepaying all of the Borrowings as a result of an LC Exposure, cash collateralize such excess as provided
in Section 2.08(j). The Borrower shall be obligated to make such prepayment and/or cash collateralize such excess within ninety (90) days following the date it receives the New Borrowing Base Notice in accordance with Section 2.07(d)
or the date the adjustment occurs pursuant to Section 8.13(c); provided that all payments required to be made pursuant to this Section 3.04(c)(ii) must be made on or prior to the Termination Date. 
(iii) Upon any adjustment to the Borrowing Base pursuant to Section 2.07(e), Section 2.07(f) or
Section 9.12(d), if the total Revolving Credit Exposure exceeds the Borrowing Base as adjusted, then the Borrower shall (A) prepay the Borrowings in an aggregate principal amount equal to such excess, and (B) if any excess remains
after prepaying all of the Borrowings as a result of an LC Exposure, cash collateralize such excess as provided in Section 2.08(j). The Borrower shall be obligated to make such prepayment and/or cash collateralize such excess (A) in the
case of an adjustment pursuant to Section 2.07(e) or Section 2.07(f), on the date the adjustment occurs and (B) in the case of an adjustment to the Borrowing Base pursuant to Section 9.12(d), on the date that the relevant sale or
other disposition occurs; provided that all payments required to be made pursuant to this Section 3.04(c)(iii) must be made on or prior to the Termination Date. 
(iv) Each prepayment of Borrowings pursuant to this Section 3.04(c) shall be applied, first, ratably to any ABR
Borrowings then outstanding, and, second, to any Eurodollar Borrowings then outstanding, and if more than one Eurodollar Borrowing is then outstanding, to each such Eurodollar Borrowing in order of priority beginning with the Eurodollar Borrowing
with the least number of days remaining in the Interest Period applicable thereto and ending with the Eurodollar Borrowing with the most number of days remaining in the Interest Period applicable thereto. 
(v) Each prepayment of Borrowings pursuant to this Section 3.04(c) shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in
the prepaid Borrowings. Prepayments pursuant to this Section 3.04(c) shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 3.02.  (d) No Premium or Penalty. Prepayments permitted or required under this Section 3.04 shall be without premium or penalty, except as required under Section 5.02. 
   41 






 Section 3.05 Fees. 
(a) Commitment Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a commitment fee, which
shall accrue at the applicable Commitment Fee Rate on the average daily amount of the unused amount of the Commitment of such Lender during the period from and including the date of this Agreement to but excluding the Termination Date. Accrued
commitment fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year and on the Termination Date, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof. All commitment fees shall be
computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, unless such computation would exceed the Highest Lawful Rate, in which case such commitment fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and shall be payable for
the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).  (b) Letter of Credit Fees. The
Borrower agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a participation fee with respect to its participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the same Applicable Margin used to determine the interest
rate applicable to Eurodollar Loans on the average daily amount of such Lenders LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the date of this Agreement to but
excluding the later of the date on which such Lenders Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure, (ii) to the Issuing Bank a fronting fee, which shall accrue at the rate of 0.200% per annum
on the average daily amount of the LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the date of this Agreement to but excluding the later of the date of termination of the
Commitments and the date on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure; provided that in no event shall such fee be less than $500 during any quarter, and (iii) to the Issuing Bank, for its own account, its standard fees with respect to
the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder. Participation fees and fronting fees accrued through and including the last day of March, June, September and December of each year
shall be payable on the later of (i) the third Business Day following such last day or (ii) three Business Days after the Borrowers receipt of a notice therefore from the Administrative Agent, commencing on the first such date to
occur after the date of this Agreement; provided that all such fees shall be payable on the Termination Date and any such fees accruing after the Termination Date shall be payable on demand. Any other fees payable to the Issuing Bank pursuant
to this Section 3.05(b) shall be payable within 10 days after demand. All participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, unless, if such fees are deemed interest, such computation would exceed the
Highest Lawful Rate, in which case such fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).
 (c) Administrative Agent Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, fees
payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in the Fee Letter between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent dated March 25, 2013. 
   42 






 (d) Borrowing Base Increase Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative
Agent, for the account of each Lender then party to this Agreement, ratably in accordance with its Applicable Percentage, a Borrowing Base increase fee equal to 25 bps on the amount of any increase of the Borrowing Base over the highest Borrowing
Base previously in effect, payable on the effective date of any such increase to the Borrowing Base.  ARTICLE IV
 PAYMENTS; PRO RATA TREATMENT; SHARING OF SET-OFFS 
Section 4.01 Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs. 
(a) Payments by the Borrower. The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal,
interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 5.01, Section 5.02, Section 5.03 or otherwise) prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds,
without defense, deduction, recoupment, set-off or counterclaim. Fees, once paid, shall be fully earned and shall not be refundable under any circumstances. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the
Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices specified in Section 12.01,
except payments to be made directly to the Issuing Bank as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Section 5.01, Section 5.02, Section 5.03 and Section 12.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled
thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a
Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder shall be made in
dollars.  (b) Application of Insufficient Payments. If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to
the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among
the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled
thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.  (c)
Sharing of Payments by Lenders. If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements
resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving
such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and participations in LC Disbursements of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders
ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and participations in LC Disbursements; provided that (i) if any such participations are

   43 






 
purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without
interest, and (ii) the provisions of this Section 4.01(c) shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as
consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of
this Section 4.01(c) shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise
against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. 
Section 4.02 Presumption of Payment by the Borrower. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the
Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such
payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of
the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date
such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on
interbank compensation.  Section 4.03 Payments and Deductions by the Administrative Agent; Defaulting Lenders.
 (a) Certain Deductions by the Administrative Agent. If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made
by it pursuant to Section 2.05(b), Section 2.08(d), Section 2.08(e), Section 4.02, Section 5.03(h) or Section 12.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision
hereof), (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender for the benefit of the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank to satisfy such Lenders obligations to it under such Section
until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid, and/or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under any such Section, in the case of
each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion. 
(b) Payments to Defaulting Lenders. If a Defaulting Lender (or a Lender who would be a Defaulting Lender but for the expiration of
the relevant grace period) as a result of the exercise of a set-off shall have received a payment in respect of its Revolving Credit Exposure which results in its Revolving Credit Exposure being less than its Applicable Percentage of the aggregate
Revolving Credit Exposures, then no payments will be made to such Defaulting Lender until such time as such Defaulting Lender shall have complied with Section 
   44 






 
4.03(c) and all amounts due and owing to the Lenders have been equalized in accordance with each Lenders respective pro rata share of the Indebtedness. Further, if at any time prior to the
acceleration or maturity of the Loans, the Administrative Agent shall receive any payment in respect of principal of a Loan or a reimbursement of an LC Disbursement while one or more Defaulting Lenders shall be party to this Agreement, the
Administrative Agent shall apply such payment first to the Borrowing(s) for which such Defaulting Lender(s) shall have failed to fund its pro rata share until such time as such Borrowing(s) are paid in full or each Lender (including each Defaulting
Lender) is owed its Applicable Percentage of all Loans then outstanding. After acceleration or maturity of the Loans, subject to the first sentence of this Section 4.03(b), all principal will be paid ratably as provided in
Section 10.02(c).  (c) Defaulting Lenders. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any
Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:  (i) Fees shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 3.05(a). 
(ii) The Commitment, the Maximum Credit Amount and the Revolving Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be
included in determining whether the Required Lenders or the Majority Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment or waiver pursuant to Section 12.02); provided that any waiver, amendment or
modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender; and provided further that any redetermination or affirmation of the Borrowing Base shall occur without the
participation of a Defaulting Lender, but the Commitment (i.e., the Applicable Percentage of the Borrowing Base of a Defaulting Lender) may not be increased without the consent of such Defaulting Lender. 
(iii) If any LC Exposure exists at the time a Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then: 
(A) all or any part of the LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with
their respective Applicable Percentages (for the purposes of such reallocation the Defaulting Lenders Commitment shall be disregarded in determining the Non-Defaulting Lenders Applicable Percentage) but only to the extent (1) the
sum of all Non-Defaulting Lenders Revolving Credit Exposures plus such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure does not exceed the total of all NonDefaulting Lenders Commitments, and (2) the sum of each Non-Defaulting
Lenders Revolving Credit Exposure plus its reallocated share of such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure does not exceed such Non-Defaulting Lenders Commitment;  (B) if the reallocation described in clause (A) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, then the Borrower shall within one Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent cash
collateralize for the benefit of the Issuing Bank only the Borrowers obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (A) above) in accordance with
the procedures set forth in Section 2.08(j) for so long as such LC Exposure is outstanding; 
   45 






 (C) if the Borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lenders LC
Exposure pursuant to clause (B) above, then the Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 3.05(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure during the period such
Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure is cash collateralized;  (D) if the LC Exposure of the Non-Defaulting Lenders is
reallocated pursuant to clause (A) above, then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 3.05(a) and Section 3.05(b) shall be adjusted in accordance with such Non-Defaulting Lenders Applicable Percentages; 
(E) if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure is neither reallocated nor cash collateralized pursuant to clause
(A) or (B) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the Issuing Bank or any Lender hereunder, all commitment fees that otherwise would have been payable to such Defaulting Lender (solely with respect to the portion of
such Defaulting Lenders Commitment that was utilized by such LC Exposure) and letter of credit fees payable under Section 3.05(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure shall be payable to the Issuing Bank until such LC
Exposure is reallocated and/or cash collateralized; and  (iv) So long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender,
the Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure and the Defaulting Lenders then outstanding LC Exposure will be 100% covered by the Commitments of the
Non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the Borrower in accordance with Section 4.03(c), and participating interests in any such newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among Non-Defaulting
Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 4.03(c)(iii)(A) (and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein). 
In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the Issuing Bank each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately
remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, and such Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, then the LC Exposure of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lenders Commitment and on such
date, if necessary, such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans and/or participations in Letters of Credit of the other Lenders as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in
accordance with its Applicable Percentage.  Section 4.04 Disposition of Proceeds. The Security Instruments contain
a collateral assignment by the Borrower and/or the Guarantors unto and in favor of the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders of all of the Borrowers or each Guarantors interest in and to production and all proceeds
attributable thereto which may be produced from or allocated to the Mortgaged Property. The Security Instruments further provide in general for the application of such proceeds to the satisfaction of the Indebtedness and other obligations described
therein and 
   46 






 
secured thereby. Notwithstanding such assignment contained in such Security Instruments, unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, (a) the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders agree that they will neither notify the purchaser or purchasers of such production nor take any other action to cause such proceeds to be remitted to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, but the Lenders will instead permit such proceeds
to be paid to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and (b) the Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent to take such actions as may be necessary to cause such proceeds to be paid to the Borrower and/or such Subsidiaries. 
ARTICLE V 
INCREASED COSTS; BREAK FUNDING PAYMENTS; TAXES; ILLEGALITY  Section 5.01 Increased Costs.  (a) Eurodollar Changes in Law.
If any Change in Law shall:  (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar
requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate); or 
(ii) subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses
(b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital
attributable thereto; or  (iii) impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition
affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender;  and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to
such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender in connection with any such Loan (whether of principal,
interest or otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. 
(b) Capital Requirements. If any Lender or the Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has
or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders or the Issuing Banks capital or on the capital of such Lenders or the Issuing Banks holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the
Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lenders or the Issuing Banks holding
company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lenders or the Issuing Banks policies and the policies of such Lenders or the Issuing Banks holding company with respect to capital
adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lenders or the Issuing Banks
holding company for any such reduction suffered. 
   47 






 (c) Certificates. A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Bank setting forth in
reasonable detail the computation of the amount or amounts (as determined reasonably and in good faith) necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in Section 5.01(a) or
(b) shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt
thereof. Each such certificate shall contain the representation and warranty of the Person sending it that the Borrower is being treated no less favorably with respect to amounts being charged under Section 5.01(a) and (b) than are other
similarly situated customers of such Lenders or Issuing Bank.  (d) Effect of Failure or Delay in Requesting
Compensation. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section 5.01 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders or the Issuing Banks right to demand such
compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section 5.01 for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender
or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lenders or the Issuing Banks intention to claim compensation therefor; provided
further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. 
Section 5.02 Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than
on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan into an ABR Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto,
(c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Eurodollar Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto, or (d) the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period
applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 5.04, then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurodollar
Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event
not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or
continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at
the commencement of such period, for dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar market.  A
certificate of any Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the computation thereof any amount or amounts (determined reasonably and in good faith) that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 5.02 shall be delivered to the
Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof. 
   48 






 Section 5.03 Taxes. 
(a) Defined Terms. For purposes of this Section 5.03, the term Lender includes any Issuing Bank and the term
applicable law includes FATCA.  (b) Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of any
obligation of the Borrower or any Guarantor under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law. If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith
discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall
timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the Borrower or a Guarantor, as applicable, shall be increased
as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have
received had no such deduction or withholding been made.  (c) Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower. The Borrower
shall pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes. 
(d) Indemnification by the Borrower. The Borrower shall indemnify each Recipient, within 10 days after written demand therefor,
for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes paid by such Recipient on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower or any Guarantor hereunder or in connection with any Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes
or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 5.03) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were
correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability under this Section 5.03 shall be delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent) or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, and any such certificate shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  (e) Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or by the Borrower or a Guarantor to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the
Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent.  (f) Status of Lenders. (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of
withholding tax with respect to payments under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the
Administrative 
   49 






 
Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made
without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the
Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 5.03(f)(ii)(A), Section 5.03(f)(ii)(B) and Section 5.03(f)(ii)(D) below) shall not be
required if in the Lenders judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. 
(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing: 
(A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such
Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 (or any
successor form) certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. Federal backup withholding tax;  (B) any Foreign Lender shall,
to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this
Agreement (and from time to time thereafter at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable: 
(1) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with
respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN (or any successor form) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the interest article of such
tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN (or any successor form) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the business
profits or other income article of such tax treaty;  (2) executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI (or any
successor form);  (3) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under
Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-1 to the effect that (A) such Foreign Lender is not a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a 10
percent shareholder of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a controlled foreign 
   50 






 
corporation described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (B) the interest payments in question are not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business conducted by such
Foreign Lender or are effectively connected but are not includible in the Foreign Lenders gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes under an income tax treaty (a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate) and (y) executed
originals of IRS Form W-8BEN (or any successor form); or  (4) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner,
executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY (or any successor form), accompanied by a Form W-8ECI (or any successor form), W-8BEN (or any successor form), a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-2 or Exhibit H-3, Form W-9
(or any successor form), and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the
portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-4 on behalf of each such direct or indirect partner; 
(C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in
such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or upon the
reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with
such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and 
(D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such
Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of
the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such
Lender has complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the
date of this Agreement.  Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes
obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. 
   51 






 (g) Treatment of Certain Refunds. If any party determines, in its sole
discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 5.03 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 5.03), it shall pay
to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such
indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the
amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (g) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental
Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (g), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (g) the payment of which would place the
indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the
indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes
that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.  (h) Indemnification by the Lenders. Each
Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrower has not already indemnified the Administrative
Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lenders failure to comply with the provisions of Section 12.04(c)(ii) relating to the maintenance of
a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with
respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be
conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender
from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this Section 5.03(h).  (i) Effect of
Failure or Delay in Requesting Indemnification. Failure or delay on the part of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank to demand indemnification pursuant to this Section 5.03 shall not constitute a waiver of the
Administrative Agents, such Lenders or the Issuing Banks right to demand such indemnification; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to indemnify the Administrative Agent, a Lender or the Issuing Bank pursuant to this
Section 5.03 for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the event giving rise to such
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes and of the Administrative Agents, such Lenders or the Issuing Banks intention to claim indemnification therefor; provided further that, if the event giving rise to indemnification is retroactive,
then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. 
   52 






 Section 5.04 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. 
(a) Designation of Different Lending Office. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 5.01, or if the Borrower is
required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 5.03, or any Lender gives a notice pursuant to Section 5.05, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts
to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or
assignment (i) would (A) eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 5.01 or Section 5.03, as the case may be, in the future or (B) eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to Section 5.05, and
(ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any
such designation or assignment.  (b) Replacement of Lenders. If (i) any Lender or the Issuing Bank requests
compensation under Section 5.01 or gives a notice pursuant to Section 5.05, (ii) the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender, the Issuing Bank or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender or the
Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 5.03, (iii) any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender or the Issuing Bank defaults in its obligation to issue Letters of Credit hereunder, (iv) pursuant to Section 2.07(c)(iii), any Lender votes
against an increase in the Borrowing Base when such increase has been approved by at least the Required Lenders, or (v) any Lender does not consent to any proposed amendment, waiver or modification of any provision of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document that requires the consent of each Lender or each Lender directly affected thereby with respect to which the consent of the Required Lenders has been obtained, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and
effort, upon notice to such Lender (or the Issuing Bank) and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender (or the Issuing Bank) to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in
Section 12.04(b)), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) such
Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the
extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (ii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 5.01 or payments
required to be made pursuant to Section 5.03, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by
such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if such Lender any
Affiliate of such Lender is party to an outstanding Swap Agreement with the Borrower or any Subsidiary, unless on or prior thereto, all such Swap Agreements have been terminated or novated to another Person and such Lender (or its Affiliate)

   53 






 
shall have received payment of all amounts, if any, payable to it in connection with such termination or novation. Each Lender agrees that if it is replaced pursuant to this Section 5.04(b),
it shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption to evidence such sale and purchase and shall deliver to the Administrative Agent any Note (if the assigning Lenders Loans are evidenced by a Note) subject to
such Assignment and Assumption; provided that the failure of any Lender replaced pursuant to this Section 5.04(b) to execute an Assignment and Assumption or deliver such Note shall not render such sale and purchase (and the corresponding
assignment) invalid and such assignment shall be recorded in the Register and the Note shall be deemed cancelled upon such failure. Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent (such appointment being coupled with an interest) as
such Lenders attorney-in-fact, with full authority in the place and stead of such Lender and in the name of such Lender, from time to time in the Administrative Agents discretion, with prior written notice to such Lender, to take any
action and to execute any such Assignment and Assumption or other instrument that the Administrative Agent may deem reasonably necessary to carry out the provisions of this Section 5.04(b). 
Section 5.05 Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in the event that it becomes unlawful for any
Lender or its applicable lending office to honor its obligation to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans either generally or having a particular Interest Period hereunder, then (a) such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent thereof and such Lenders obligation to make such Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended (the Affected Loans) until such time as such Lender may again make and maintain such Eurodollar Loans and (b) all
Affected Loans which would otherwise be made by such Lender shall be made instead as ABR Loans (and, if such Lender so requests by notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, all Affected Loans of such Lender then outstanding shall be
automatically converted into ABR Loans on the date specified by such Lender in such notice) and, to the extent that Affected Loans are so made as (or converted into) ABR Loans, all payments of principal which would otherwise be applied to such
Lenders Affected Loans shall be applied instead to its ABR Loans.  ARTICLE VI 
CONDITIONS PRECEDENT  Section 6.01 Effective Date. The obligations of the Lenders to make Loans and of the Issuing Bank to issue Letters of Credit hereunder shall not become effective until the date on which each

(q) The Administrative Agent shall have received such other documents as the Administrative Agent or special counsel to the Administrative Agent may reasonably request.

Without limiting the generality of the provisions of Section 11.04, for purposes of determining compliance with the conditions specified in this Section 6.01, each Lender that has signed this
Agreement shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with, each document or other matter required thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to a Lender unless the Administrative
Agent shall have received written notice from such Lender prior to the proposed Effective Date specifying its objection thereto.  Section 6.02 Each Credit Event. The obligation of each Lender to make a Loan on the occasion of any Borrowing (including the initial funding), and of the Issuing Bank to issue, amend, renew or

shall be true and correct on and as of the date of such Borrowing or the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of such Letter of Credit, as applicable, except to the extent any such representations and warranties are expressly limited to
an earlier date, in which case, on and as of the date of such Borrowing or the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of such Letter of Credit, as applicable, such representations and warranties shall continue to be true and correct as of
such specified earlier date and except for purposes of this Section 6.02, the representations and warranties contained in Section 7.04(b) shall be deemed to refer to the fiscal year end date of the most recent financial statement delivered

ARTICLE VII

consent, approval, registration, filing or other action necessary for the validity or enforceability of any Loan Document against the Borrower or any Guarantor as herein provided or the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, except
such as have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect other than (i) the recording and filing of the Security Instruments as required by this Agreement and (ii) those third party approvals or consents which, if not made or

payment to be made by the Borrower or such Subsidiary and (d) will not result in the creation or imposition of any consentual Lien by the Borrower or any Subsidiary on any Property of the
Borrower or any Subsidiary (other than the Liens created by the Loan Documents).  Section 7.04 Financial Condition; No
Material Adverse Change.  (a) The Borrower has heretofore furnished to the Lenders (i) its consolidated balance sheet

Borrower, threatened against or affecting the Borrower or any Subsidiary (i) not fully covered by insurance (except for normal deductibles) as to which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse determination that, if adversely determined,

 Section 7.07 Compliance with the Laws and Agreements; No Defaults. 
(a) Each of the Borrower and each Subsidiary (i) is in compliance with all Governmental Requirements applicable to it or its
Property and all agreements and other instruments binding upon it or its Property, and (ii) possesses all licenses, permits, franchises, exemptions, approvals and other authorizations granted by Governmental Authorities necessary for the
ownership of its Property and the conduct of its business, except in either case where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. 
(b) Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is in default nor has any event or circumstance occurred which, but for the expiration of any
applicable grace period or the giving of notice, or both, would constitute a default or would require the Borrower or a Subsidiary to Redeem or make any offer to Redeem under any indenture, note, credit agreement or instrument pursuant to which any
Material Indebtedness is outstanding or by which the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any of their Properties is bound.  (c) No
Default has occurred and is continuing.  Section 7.08 Investment Company Act. Neither the Borrower nor any
Subsidiary is an investment company or a company controlled by an investment company, within the meaning of, or subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. 
Section 7.09 Taxes. Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries has timely filed or caused to be filed all Tax returns and
reports required to have been filed and has paid or caused to be paid all Taxes required to have been paid by it, except (a) Taxes that are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which the Borrower or such Subsidiary,
as applicable, has set aside on its books adequate reserves in accordance with GAAP or (b) to the extent that the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The charges, accruals and reserves on
the books of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries in respect of Taxes and other governmental charges are, in the reasonable opinion of the Borrower, adequate. No Tax Lien (other than an Excepted Lien of the type in (a) of the definition thereof)
has been filed and, to the knowledge of the Borrower, no claim is being asserted with respect to any such Tax or other such governmental charge.  Section 7.10 ERISA.  (a) Except for such noncompliance as could not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, the Borrower, the Subsidiaries and each ERISA Affiliate have complied with ERISA and, where applicable, the Code regarding each Plan. 
(b) Except as could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, each Plan is, and
has been, maintained in substantial compliance with ERISA and, where applicable, the Code. 
   61 






 (c) Except as could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect, no act, omission or transaction has occurred which could result in imposition on the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate (whether directly or indirectly) of (i) either a civil penalty assessed pursuant to
subsections (c), (i) or (l) of section 502 of ERISA or a tax imposed pursuant to Chapter 43 of Subtitle D of the Code or (ii) breach of fiduciary duty liability damages under section 409 of ERISA. 
(d) No Plan (other than a defined contribution plan) or any trust created under any such Plan has been terminated in a distress
termination under Section 4041(c) of ERISA since January 1, 2000. Except as could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, no liability to the PBGC (other than for the payment of

Effect, no ERISA Event with respect to any Plan has occurred.  (e) Except as could not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, full payment when due has been made of all amounts which the Borrower, the Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate is required under the terms of each Plan or applicable law to have paid as
contributions to such Plan as of the date hereof, and no accumulated funding deficiency (as defined in section 302 of ERISA and section 412 of the Code), whether or not waived, exists with respect to any Plan. 
(f) Except as could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, the actuarial
present value of the benefit liabilities under each Plan which is subject to Title IV of ERISA does not, as of the end of the Borrowers most recently ended fiscal year, exceed the current value of the assets (computed on a plan termination
basis in accordance with Title IV of ERISA) of such Plan allocable to such benefit liabilities. The term actuarial present value of the benefit liabilities shall have the meaning specified in section 4041 of ERISA. 
(g) Except as could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, neither the
Borrower, the Subsidiaries nor any ERISA Affiliate sponsors, maintains, or contributes to an employee welfare benefit plan, as defined in section 3(1) of ERISA, including, without limitation, any such plan maintained to provide benefits to
former employees of such entities, that may not be terminated by the Borrower, a Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate in its sole discretion at any time.  (h) Except as could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, neither the Borrower, the Subsidiaries nor any ERISA Affiliate sponsors, maintains or
contributes to, or has at any time in the six-year period preceding the date hereof sponsored, maintained or contributed to, any Multiemployer Plan.  (i) Except for amounts less than $100,000, neither the Borrower, the Subsidiaries nor any ERISA Affiliate is required to provide security under section 401(a)(29) of the Code due to a Plan amendment that

   62 






 Section 7.11 Disclosure; No Material Misstatements. The Borrower has disclosed
to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders all agreements, instruments and corporate or other restrictions to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, and all other matters known to it, that, individually or in the aggregate, could, if
breached or violated by, enforced against, or adversely determined in relation to, the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. No reports, financial statements, certificates or other
information furnished by or on behalf of the Borrower or any Subsidiary to the Administrative Agent or any Lender or any of their Affiliates in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or delivered hereunder or
under any other Loan Document (as modified or supplemented by other information so furnished) contains any material misstatement of fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading; provided that, with respect to projected financial information, the Borrower represents only that such information was prepared in good faith based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at the
time. There are no statements or conclusions in any Reserve Report prepared by the chief engineer of the Borrower (and with respect to a Reserve Report prepared by an Approved Petroleum Engineer, to the knowledge of a Responsible Officer of the
Borrower), which are based upon or include misleading information or fail to take into account material information regarding the matters reported therein.  Section 7.12 Insurance. The Borrower maintains, and has caused to be maintained for each of its Subsidiaries, with financially sound and reputable insurance companies, insurance in such
amounts and against such risks as are customarily maintained by companies engaged in the same or similar businesses operating in the same or similar locations. The loss payable clauses or provisions in said insurance policy or policies insuring any
of the collateral for the Loans are endorsed in favor of and made payable to the Administrative Agent as its interests may appear, and such policies name the Administrative Agent and the Lenders as additional insureds and provide that
the insurer will endeavor to give at least 30 days prior notice of any cancellation to the Administrative Agent. 
Section 7.13 Restriction on Liens. Neither the Borrower nor any of the Subsidiaries is a party to any material agreement or
arrangement (other than (a) the Senior Debt Indenture and (b) Capital Leases creating Liens permitted by Section 9.03(c), but then only on the Property subject of such Capital Lease), or subject to any order, judgment, writ or decree,
which either restricts or purports to restrict its ability to grant Liens to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders on or in respect of their Properties to secure the Indebtedness and the Loan Documents, except, in each case, as provided in
Section 9.16.  Section 7.14 Subsidiaries. Except as set forth on Schedule 7.14 or as disclosed in writing to
the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly furnish a copy to the Lenders), which shall be a supplement to Schedule 7.14, the Borrower has no Subsidiaries and the Borrower has no Foreign Subsidiaries. Each Subsidiary on such schedule is a
Wholly-Owned Subsidiary.  Section 7.15 Location of Business and Offices. The Borrowers jurisdiction of
organization is Delaware; the name of the Borrower as listed in the public records of its jurisdiction of organization is Rex Energy Corporation; and the organizational identification number of the Borrower in its jurisdiction of organization is
4313846 (or, in each case, as set forth in a notice delivered to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 8.01(n) in accordance with Section 12.01). The Borrowers principal place of business and chief executive offices are

   63 






 
located at the address specified in Section 12.01 (or as set forth in a notice delivered pursuant to Section 8.01(n) and Section 12.01(c)). Each Subsidiarys jurisdiction of
organization, name as listed in the public records of its jurisdiction of organization, organizational identification number in its jurisdiction of organization, and the location of its principal place of business and chief executive office is
stated on Schedule 7.14 (or as set forth in a notice delivered pursuant to Section 8.01(n)).  Section 7.16
Properties; Titles, Etc.  (a) Each of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries has good and defensible title to the Oil and
Gas Properties evaluated in the most recently delivered Reserve Report and to all its personal Properties, in each case, free and clear of all Liens except Liens permitted by Section 9.03 and such defects in title as could not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to materially distract from the value thereof to, or the use thereof in, the business of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries. After giving full effect to the Excepted Liens, the Borrower or the Subsidiary
specified as the owner owns the net interests in production attributable to the Hydrocarbon Interests as reflected in the most recently delivered Reserve Report, and the ownership of such Properties shall not in any material respect obligate the
Borrower or such Subsidiary to bear the costs and expenses relating to the maintenance, development and operations of each such Property in an amount in excess of the working interest of each Property set forth in the most recently delivered Reserve
Report that is not offset by a corresponding proportionate increase in the Borrowers or such Subsidiarys net revenue interest in such Property.  (b) All material leases and agreements necessary for the conduct of the business of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries in all material respects are valid and subsisting, in full force and effect, and there
exists no default or event or circumstance which with the giving of notice or the passage of time or both would give rise to a default under any such lease or leases, which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 
(c) The rights and Properties presently owned, leased or licensed by the Borrower and the Subsidiaries including, without limitation, all
easements and rights of way, include all rights and Properties necessary to permit the Borrower and the Subsidiaries to conduct their business in all material respects in the same manner as its business has been conducted prior to the date hereof.
 (d) All of the personal Properties of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries which are reasonably necessary for the operation of
their businesses in all material respects are in good working condition and are maintained in accordance with prudent business standards, except for such Properties as could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect.  (e) The Borrower and each Subsidiary owns, or possesses the right to use, all trademarks,
tradenames, copyrights, patents and other intellectual Property material to its business, and the use thereof by the Borrower and such Subsidiary does not infringe upon the rights of any other Person, except for any such infringements that,
individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The 
   64 






 
Borrower and its Subsidiaries either own or have valid licenses or other rights to use all databases, geological data, geophysical data, engineering data, seismic data, maps, interpretations and
other technical information used in their businesses as presently conducted, subject to the limitations contained in the agreements governing the use of the same, which limitations are customary for companies engaged in the business of the
exploration and production of Hydrocarbons, with such exceptions as could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.  Section 7.17 Maintenance of Properties. Except for such acts or failures to act as could not be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, the Oil and Gas Properties (and
Properties unitized therewith) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries have been maintained, operated and developed by the Borrower or its Subsidiaries in a good and workmanlike manner and in conformity in all material respects with all applicable
Governmental Requirements and in conformity in all material respects with the provisions of all leases, subleases or other contracts comprising a part of the Hydrocarbon Interests and other contracts and agreements forming a part of the Oil and Gas
Properties of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, in each case to which the Borrower or its Subsidiaries are a party. Specifically in connection with the foregoing, except for those as could not be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect, (i) no Oil and Gas Property of the Borrower or any Subsidiary is subject to having allowable production reduced below the full and regular allowable (including the maximum permissible tolerance) because of any overproduction (whether or
not the same was permissible at the time) and (ii) none of the wells comprising a part of the Oil and Gas Properties (or Properties unitized therewith) of the Borrower or any Subsidiary is deviated from the vertical more than the maximum
permitted by Governmental Requirements, and such wells are, in fact, bottomed under and are producing from, and the well bores are wholly within, the Oil and Gas Properties (or in the case of wells located on Properties unitized therewith, such
unitized Properties) of the Borrower or such Subsidiary. All pipelines, wells, gas processing plants, platforms and other material improvements, fixtures and equipment owned in whole or in part by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that are
necessary to conduct normal operations in all material respects are being maintained in a condition reasonably adequate to conduct normal operations, and with respect to such of the foregoing which are operated by the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries, in a manner consistent with the Borrowers or its Subsidiaries past practices (other than those the failure of which to maintain in accordance with this Section 7.17 could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.  Section 7.18 Gas Imbalances, Prepayments. Except as set forth on Schedule 7.18 or on the most
recent certificate delivered pursuant to Section 8.12(c), on a net basis there are no gas imbalances, take or pay or other prepayments which would require the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to deliver Hydrocarbons produced from the Oil and
Gas Properties at some future time without then or thereafter receiving full payment therefor exceeding one-half bcf of gas (on an mcf equivalent basis) in the aggregate.  Section 7.19 Marketing of Production. Except for contracts listed and in effect on the date hereof on Schedule 7.19, and thereafter either disclosed in writing to the Administrative Agent or
included in the most recently delivered Reserve Report (with respect to all of which contracts the Borrower represents that it or its Subsidiaries are receiving a price for all production sold thereunder which is computed substantially in accordance
with the terms of the 
   65 






 
relevant contract and are not having deliveries curtailed substantially below the subject Propertys delivery capacity), no material agreements exist which are not cancelable on 60
days notice or less without penalty or detriment for the sale of production from the Borrowers or its Subsidiaries Hydrocarbons (including, without limitation, calls on or other rights to purchase, production, whether or not the
same are currently being exercised) that (a) pertain to the sale of production at a fixed price and (b) have a maturity or expiry date of longer than six (6) months from the date hereof. 
Section 7.20 Swap Agreements. Schedule 7.20, as of the date hereof, and after the date hereof, each report required to be
delivered by the Borrower pursuant to Section 8.01(f), sets forth a true and complete list of all Swap Agreements of the Borrower and each Subsidiary, the material terms thereof (including the type, term, effective date, termination date and
notional amounts or volumes), the net mark to market value thereof, all credit support agreements relating thereto (including any margin required or supplied) and the counterparty to each such agreement. 
Section 7.21 Use of Loans and Letters of Credit. The proceeds of the Loans and the Letters of Credit shall be used to provide
working capital for exploration and production operations and for general corporate purposes. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries are not engaged principally, or as one of its or their important activities, in the business of extending credit for the
purpose, whether immediate, incidental or ultimate, of buying or carrying margin stock (within the meaning of Regulation T, U or X of the Board). No part of the proceeds of any Loan or Letter of Credit will be used for any purpose which violates the
provisions of Regulations T, U or X of the Board.  Section 7.22 Solvency. After giving effect to the transactions
contemplated hereby, (a) the aggregate assets (after giving effect to amounts that could reasonably be received by reason of indemnity, offset, insurance or any similar arrangement), at a fair valuation, of the Borrower and the Guarantors,
taken as a whole, will exceed the aggregate Debt of the Borrower and the Guarantors on a consolidated basis, as the Debt becomes absolute and matures, (b) each of the Borrower and the Guarantors will not have incurred or intended to incur, and
will not believe that it will incur, Debt beyond its ability to pay such Debt (after taking into account the timing and amounts of cash to be received by each of the Borrower and the Guarantors and the amounts to be payable on or in respect of its
liabilities, and giving effect to amounts that could reasonably be received by reason of indemnity, offset, insurance or any similar arrangement) as such Debt becomes absolute and matures and (c) each of the Borrower and the Guarantors will not
have (and will have no reason to believe that it will have thereafter) unreasonably small capital for the conduct of its business.  Section 7.23 International Operations. None of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries own, and have not acquired or made any other expenditure (whether such expenditure is capital, operating or
otherwise) in or related to, any Oil and Gas Properties located outside of the geographical boundaries of the United States or in the offshore federal waters of the United States of America. 
Section 7.24 OFAC. Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any director, officer, agent, employee or Affiliate
of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is currently subject to any material U.S. sanctions administered by OFAC, and the Borrower will not directly 
   66 






 
or indirectly use the proceeds from the Loans or lend, contribute or otherwise make available such proceeds to any Subsidiary, joint venture partner or other Person, for the purpose of financing
the activities of any Person currently subject to any U.S. sanctions administered by OFAC.  ARTICLE VIII

soon as possible, but in any event no later than thirty (30) days following the receipt of such request.  (c) With the
delivery of each Reserve Report, the Borrower shall provide to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders a certificate from a Responsible Officer certifying that in all material respects: (i) the factual information contained in the Reserve
Report and any other information delivered in connection therewith is true and correct, (ii) the Borrower or its Subsidiaries owns good and defensible title to the Oil and Gas Properties evaluated in such Reserve Report and such Properties are
free of all Liens except for Liens permitted by Section 9.03, (iii) except as set forth on an exhibit to the certificate, on a net basis there are no gas imbalances, take or pay or other prepayments in excess of the volume specified in
Section 7.18 with respect to its Oil and Gas Properties evaluated in such Reserve Report which would require the Borrower or any Subsidiary to deliver Hydrocarbons either generally or produced from such Oil and Gas Properties at some future
time without then or thereafter receiving full payment therefor, (iv) none of their Oil and Gas Properties have been sold since the date of the last Borrowing Base determination except as set forth on an exhibit to the certificate, which
certificate shall list all of its Oil and Gas Properties sold and in such detail as reasonably required by the Administrative Agent, (v) attached to the certificate is a list of all marketing agreements entered into subsequent to the later of
the date hereof or the most recently delivered Reserve Report which the Borrower could reasonably be expected to have been obligated to list on Schedule 7.19 had such agreement been in effect on the date hereof and (vi) attached thereto is a
schedule of the Oil and Gas Properties evaluated by such Reserve Report that are Mortgaged Properties and demonstrating the percentage of the total value of the Oil and Gas Properties that the value of such Mortgaged Properties represent.
 Section 8.13 Title Information.  (a) On or before the delivery to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders of each Reserve Report required by Section 8.12(a), the Borrower will deliver title information in form and substance
acceptable to the Administrative Agent covering enough of the Oil and Gas Properties evaluated by such Reserve Report that were not included in the immediately preceding Reserve Report, so that the Administrative Agent shall have received together
with title information previously delivered to the Administrative Agent, satisfactory title information on at least 80% of the total value of the Oil and Gas Properties evaluated by such Reserve Report. 
   75 






 (b) If the Borrower has provided title information for additional Properties under
Section 8.13(a), the Borrower shall, within 60 days of notice from the Administrative Agent that title defects or exceptions (other than, of a (y) nature or type that constitutes a permitted Lien pursuant to Section 9.03 or
(z) economically insignificant nature) exist with respect to such additional Properties, either (i) cure any such title defects or exceptions (including defects or exceptions as to priority) which are not permitted by Section 9.03
raised by such information, (ii) substitute acceptable Mortgaged Properties with no title defects or exceptions except for Excepted Liens (other than Excepted Liens described in clauses (e), (g) and (h) of such definition and other
than, of a (y) nature or type that constitutes a permitted Lien pursuant to Section 9.03 or (z) economically insignificant nature) having an equivalent value or (iii) deliver title information in form and substance acceptable to
the Administrative Agent so that the Administrative Agent shall have received, together with title information previously delivered to the Administrative Agent, satisfactory title information on at least 80% of the value of the Oil and Gas
Properties evaluated by such Reserve Report.  (c) If the Borrower is unable to cure any title defect requested by the
Administrative Agent or the Lenders to be cured pursuant to Section 8.13(c) within such 60-day period or the Borrower does not comply with the requirements to provide acceptable title information covering 80% of the value of the Oil and Gas
Properties evaluated in the most recent Reserve Report, such default shall not be a Default, but instead the Administrative Agent and/or the Required Lenders shall have the right to exercise the following remedy in their sole discretion from time to
time, and any failure to so exercise this remedy at any time shall not be a waiver as to future exercise of the remedy by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders. To the extent that the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders are not satisfied
with title to any Oil and Gas Property after the 60-day period has elapsed, such unacceptable Oil and Gas Property shall not count towards the 80% requirement, and the Administrative Agent may send a notice to the Borrower and the Lenders that the
then outstanding Borrowing Base shall be reduced by an amount as determined by the Required Lenders to cause the Borrower to be in compliance with the requirement to provide acceptable title information on 80% of the value of the Oil and Gas
Properties. This new Borrowing Base shall become effective immediately after the Borrowers receipt of such notice. 
Section 8.14 Additional Collateral; Additional Guarantors. 
(a) In connection with each redetermination of the Borrowing Base, the Borrower shall review the Reserve Report and the list of current
Mortgaged Properties (as described in Section 8.12(c)(vi)) to ascertain whether the Mortgaged Properties represent at least 80% of the total value of the Oil and Gas Properties evaluated in the most recently completed Reserve Report after
giving effect to exploration and production activities, acquisitions, dispositions and production. In the event that the Mortgaged Properties do not represent at least 80% of such total value, then the Borrower shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, grant (from its available unencumbered Property), within thirty (30) days of delivery of the certificate required under Section 8.12(c), to the Administrative Agent as security for the Indebtedness a first-priority Lien
interest (provided that Excepted Liens of the type described in clauses (a) to (d) and (f) of the definition thereof may exist, but subject to the provisos at the end of such definition) on additional Oil and Gas Properties not
already subject to a Lien of the Security Instruments such that after giving effect thereto, the Mortgaged Properties will represent at least 
   76 






 
80% of such total value. All such Liens will be created and perfected by and in accordance with the provisions of deeds of trust, security agreements and financing statements or other Security
Instruments, all in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower and in sufficient executed (and acknowledged where necessary or appropriate) counterparts for recording purposes. In order to comply with the
foregoing, if any Subsidiary places a Lien on its Oil and Gas Properties and such Subsidiary is not a Guarantor, then it shall become a Guarantor and comply with Section 8.14(b). 
(b) In the event that the Borrower determines that any Subsidiary is a Material Domestic Subsidiary, the Borrower shall promptly cause
such Subsidiary to guarantee the Indebtedness pursuant to the Guaranty Agreement. In connection with any such guaranty, the Borrower shall, or shall cause such Subsidiary to, (A) execute and deliver a supplement to the Guaranty Agreement
executed by such Subsidiary, (B) pledge all of the Equity Interests of such new Subsidiary (including, without limitation, delivery (if applicable) of original certificates evidencing the Equity Interests of such Subsidiary, together with an

by the Administrative Agent.  Section 8.15 ERISA Compliance. The Borrower will promptly furnish and will cause the
Subsidiaries and any ERISA Affiliate to promptly furnish to the Administrative Agent (i) promptly after receipt of a written request by the Administrative Agent, copies of each annual and other report with respect to each Plan or any trust
created thereunder, filed with the United States Secretary of Labor, the Internal Revenue Service or the PBGC, (ii) immediately upon becoming aware of the occurrence of any ERISA Event or of any prohibited transaction, as described
in section 406 of ERISA or in section 4975 of the Code, in connection with any Plan or any trust created thereunder, a written notice signed by the Chief Executive Officer or the principal Financial Officer, the Subsidiary or the ERISA Affiliate, as
the case may be, specifying the nature thereof, what action the Borrower, the Subsidiary or the ERISA Affiliate is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto, and, when known, any action taken or proposed by the Internal Revenue Service, the
Department of Labor or the PBGC with respect thereto, and (iii) immediately upon receipt thereof, copies of any notice of the PBGCs intention to terminate or to have a trustee appointed to administer any Plan. With respect to each Plan
(other than a Multiemployer Plan), the Borrower will, and will cause each Subsidiary and ERISA Affiliate to, (i) satisfy in full and in a timely manner, without incurring any late payment or underpayment charge or penalty and without giving
rise to any lien, all of the contribution and funding requirements of section 412 of the Code (determined without regard to subsections (d), (e), (f) and (k) thereof) and of section 302 of ERISA (determined without regard to sections 303,
304 and 306 of ERISA), and (ii) pay, or cause to be paid, to the PBGC in a timely manner, without incurring any late payment or underpayment charge or penalty, all premiums required pursuant to sections 4006 and 4007 of ERISA.

activities for any Hydrocarbons or enter into any contracts related thereto other than (a) contracts for the sale of Hydrocarbons scheduled or reasonably estimated to be produced from their proved Oil and Gas Properties during the period of
such contract, (b) contracts for the sale of Hydrocarbons scheduled or reasonably estimated to 
   77 






 
be produced from proved Oil and Gas Properties of third parties during the period of such contract associated with the Oil and Gas Properties of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries that the
Borrower or one of its Subsidiaries has the right to market pursuant to joint operating agreements, unitization agreements or other similar contracts that are usual and customary in the oil and gas business and (c) other contracts for the
purchase and/or sale of Hydrocarbons of third parties (i) which have generally offsetting provisions (i.e. corresponding pricing mechanics, delivery dates and points and volumes) such that no position is taken and (ii) for
which appropriate credit support has been taken to alleviate the material credit risks of the counterparty thereto.  ARTICLE

THE AGENTS 
Section 11.01 Appointment; Powers. Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative
Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof and the other Loan Documents, together with such actions and
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, and neither the Borrower nor any Guarantor shall have rights as a third party
beneficiary of any of such provisions (other than the provisions of Section 11.06).  Section 11.02 Duties and
Obligations of Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent
shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing (the use of the term agent herein and in the other Loan Documents with reference to the Administrative Agent is
not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law; rather, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an
administrative relationship between independent contracting parties), (b) the Administrative Agent shall have no duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except as provided in Section 11.03, and
(c) except as expressly set forth herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated
to 
   92 






 
or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until
written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender, and shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with
this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or under any other Loan Document or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of
any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or in any other Loan Document, (iv) the validity, enforceability, or effectiveness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or
document, (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article VI or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent or as to those conditions precedent expressly
required to be to the Administrative Agents satisfaction, (vi) the existence, value, perfection or priority of any collateral security or the financial or other condition of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries or any other obligor or
guarantor, or (vii) any failure by the Borrower or any other Person (other than itself) to perform any of its obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document or the performance or observance of any covenants, agreements or other terms or
conditions set forth herein or therein. For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions specified in Article VI, each Lender shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with, each document or other matter
required thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to a Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received written notice from such Lender prior to the proposed closing date specifying its objection thereto.
 Section 11.03 Action by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall have no duty to take any
discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing as directed by the
Majority Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 12.02) and in all cases the Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to act
hereunder or under any other Loan Documents unless it shall (a) receive written instructions from the Majority Lenders or the Lenders, as applicable, (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the
circumstances as provided in Section 12.02) specifying the action to be taken and (b) be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expenses which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or
continuing to take any such action. The instructions as aforesaid and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto by the Administrative Agent shall be binding on all of the Lenders. If a Default has occurred and is continuing, then the
Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default as shall be directed by the requisite Lenders in the written instructions (with indemnities) described in this Section 11.03; provided that, unless and until the
Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default as it shall deem advisable in the best
interests of the Lenders. In no event, however, shall the Administrative Agent be required to take any action which exposes the Administrative Agent to personal liability or which is contrary to this Agreement, the Loan Documents or applicable law.
If a Default has occurred and is continuing, neither the Syndication Agent nor the Documentation Agent shall have any obligation to perform any act in 
   93 






 
respect thereof. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Majority Lenders or the Lenders (or such other
number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 12.02), and otherwise the Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it hereunder or under any other
Loan Document or under any other document or instrument referred to or provided for herein or therein or in connection herewith or therewith INCLUDING ITS OWN ORDINARY NEGLIGENCE, except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.
 Section 11.04 Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and
shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent
also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon and each of the Borrower, the Lenders and the Issuing Bank hereby waives the
right to dispute the Administrative Agents record of such statement, except in the case of gross negligence or willful misconduct by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the
Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. The Administrative Agent may deem and
treat the payee of any Note as the holder thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until a written notice of the assignment or transfer thereof permitted hereunder shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent. 
Section 11.05 Subagents. The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or
through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory
provisions of the preceding Sections of this Article XI shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the
syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.  Section 11.06
Resignation or Removal of Administrative Agent. Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided in this Section 11.06, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders,
the Issuing Bank and the Borrower, and the Administrative Agent may be removed at any time with or without cause by (a) the Borrower upon 45 days prior written notice or (b) the Required Lenders, with the consent of the Borrower (if no
Event of Default has occurred and is not then continuing), such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Majority Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrower in
any event, and with the consent of the Borrower if no Event of Default has occurred and is then continuing, to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Majority Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within
30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation or removal of the retiring Administrative Agent, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing

   94 






 
Bank, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as
Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from
its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the
Administrative Agents resignation or removal hereunder, the provisions of this Article XI and Section 12.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related
Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent. Any resignation or removal of any Person serving as Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section shall also constitute its
resignation or removal as the Issuing Bank. Upon the acceptance of a successors appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, (a) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of
the retiring Issuing Bank, (b) the retiring Issuing Bank shall be discharged from all of its respective duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, and (c) the successor Issuing Bank shall issue Letters of Credit in
substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to the retiring Issuing Bank to effectively assume the obligations of the retiring Issuing Bank with respect to such
Letters of Credit.  Section 11.07 Agents as Lenders. Each bank serving as an Agent hereunder shall have the same
rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with
the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not an Agent hereunder.  Section 11.08 No
Reliance. Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, any other Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement and each other Loan Document to which it is a party. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, any other Agent or any other Lender
and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document, any related agreement or any
document furnished hereunder or thereunder. The Agents shall not be required to keep themselves informed as to the performance or observance by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries of this Agreement, the Loan Documents or any other document
referred to or provided for herein or to inspect the Properties or books of the Borrower or its Subsidiaries. Except for notices, reports and other documents and information expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative
Agent hereunder, no Agent or the Arrangers shall have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the affairs, financial condition or business of the Borrower (or any of its Affiliates) which may
come into the possession of such Agent or any of its Affiliates. In this regard, each Lender acknowledges that Paul Hastings LLP is acting in this transaction as special counsel to the Administrative Agent only, except to the extent otherwise
expressly stated in any legal opinion or any Loan Document. Each other party hereto will consult with its own legal counsel to the extent that it deems necessary in connection with the Loan Documents and the matters contemplated therein. 

   95 






 Section 11.09 Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim. In case of the
pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of
whether the principal of any Loan shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by
intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:  (a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest
owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans and all other Indebtedness that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including any
claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and the Administrative Agent under
Section 12.03) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and  (b) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable
or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;  and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or
other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the
Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under
Section 12.03.  Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or
adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Indebtedness or the rights of any Lender or to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any
such proceeding.  Section 11.10 Withholding Tax. To the extent required by any applicable law, the Administrative
Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding tax. Without limiting the provisions of Section 5.03(b) or Section 5.03(d), each Lender and the Issuing Bank shall, and does hereby,
indemnify the Administrative Agent, and shall make payable in respect thereof within 30 days after demand therefor, against any and all Taxes and any and all related losses, claims, liabilities and expenses (including fees, charges and disbursements
of any counsel for the Administrative Agent) incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent by the Internal Revenue Service or any other Governmental Authority as a result of the failure of the Administrative Agent to properly withhold tax
from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender for any reason (including, without limitation, because the appropriate form was not delivered or not property executed, or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a
change in circumstance that rendered the 
   96 






 
exemption from, or reduction of withholding tax ineffective). A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender or the Issuing Bank by the Administrative Agent
shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender and the Issuing Bank hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender or the Issuing Bank under this Agreement or any other
Loan Document against any amount due the Administrative Agent under this Section 11.10. The agreements in this Section 11.10 shall survive the resignation and/or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any assignment of rights by, or the
replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Indebtedness.  Section 11.11 Authority of Administrative Agent to Release Collateral, Liens and Guarantors. Each Lender and the Issuing Bank hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to release any
collateral that is permitted to be sold or released and release any Guarantor that is permitted to be released from its obligations under the Loan Documents, in each case pursuant to the applicable terms of the Loan Documents. Each Lender and the
Issuing Bank hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to execute and deliver to the Borrower, at the Borrowers sole cost and expense, any and all releases of Liens, termination statements, assignments, release of guarantees or Guarantors (as
the case may be) or other documents reasonably requested by the Borrower in connection with any sale or other disposition of Property or any one or more Guarantors to the extent such sale or other disposition is permitted by the terms of
Section 9.12 or is otherwise authorized by the terms of the Loan Documents. The Arrangers, the Syndication Agent and the Documentation Agent  Section 11.12 The Arrangers, the Syndication Agent and the Documentation Agent. The Arrangers, the Syndication Agent and the Documentation Agent shall have no duties, responsibilities or

exercising, and no course of dealing with respect to, any right, power or privilege, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such right, power or privilege, under any of the Loan Documents shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor
shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege under any of the Loan Documents preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies of the
Administrative Agent, any other Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by Section 12.02(b), and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the

Administrative Agent, any other Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.  (b) Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof nor any Security Instrument or any provision thereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered

defined term used therein) even if the effect of such amendment would be to reduce the rate of interest on any Loan or LC Disbursement or to reduce any fee payable hereunder, (iv) postpone the scheduled date of payment or prepayment of the

CREDIT OR THE USE OF THE PROCEEDS THEREFROM, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, (A) ANY REFUSAL BY THE ISSUING BANK TO HONOR A DEMAND FOR PAYMENT UNDER A LETTER OF CREDIT IF THE DOCUMENTS PRESENTED IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH DEMAND DO NOT STRICTLY

BREACH OR NON-COMPLIANCE BY THE BORROWER OR ANY SUBSIDIARY WITH ANY ENVIRONMENTAL LAW APPLICABLE TO THE BORROWER OR ANY SUBSIDIARY, (x) THE PAST OWNERSHIP BY THE BORROWER OR ANY SUBSIDIARY OF ANY OF THEIR PROPERTIES OR PAST ACTIVITY ON ANY OF
THEIR PROPERTIES WHICH, THOUGH LAWFUL AND FULLY PERMISSIBLE AT THE TIME, COULD RESULT IN PRESENT LIABILITY, (xi) THE PRESENCE, USE, RELEASE, STORAGE, TREATMENT, DISPOSAL, GENERATION, THREATENED RELEASE, TRANSPORT, ARRANGEMENT FOR TRANSPORT OR

IN CONNECTION WITH THE LOAN DOCUMENTS, OR (xiv) ANY ACTUAL OR PROSPECTIVE CLAIM, LITIGATION, INVESTIGATION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO ANY OF THE FOREGOING, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY
INDEMNITEE IS A PARTY THERETO, AND SUCH INDEMNITY SHALL EXTEND TO EACH INDEMNITEE NOTWITHSTANDING THE SOLE OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE OF EVERY KIND OR CHARACTER WHATSOEVER, WHETHER ACTIVE OR PASSIVE, WHETHER AN AFFIRMATIVE ACT OR AN OMISSION,
INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL TYPES OF NEGLIGENT CONDUCT IDENTIFIED IN THE RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS OF ONE OR MORE OF THE INDEMNITEES OR BY REASON OF STRICT LIABILITY IMPOSED WITHOUT FAULT ON ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE INDEMNITEES;
PROVIDED THAT SUCH INDEMNITY SHALL NOT, AS TO ANY INDEMNITEE, BE AVAILABLE TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH LOSSES, CLAIMS, DAMAGES, LIABILITIES OR RELATED EXPENSES ARE DETERMINED BY A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY FINAL AND NONAPPEALABLE
JUDGMENT TO HAVE RESULTED FROM THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF, OR VIOLATION OF LAW BY, SUCH INDEMNITEE. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NO INDEMNIFICATION SHALL BE GIVEN TO THE EXTENT IT ARISES (y) BY REASON OF A CLAIM BY ONE OR
MORE INDEMNITEES AGAINST ONE OR MORE OTHER INDEMNITEES, OR (z) FROM A CLAIM BROUGHT BY THE BORROWER AGAINST AN INDEMNITEE FOR (1) SUCH INDEMNITEES BREACH OF 
   101






 
ITS OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER OR UNDER ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR (2) BAD FAITH OF SUCH INDEMNITEE HEREUNDER OR UNDER ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, IN EITHER CASE IF THE BORROWER HAS OBTAINED A FINAL
NON NONAPPEALABLE JUDGMENT IN ITS FAVOR ON SUCH CLAIM AS DETERMINED BY A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION. SO LONG AS NO DEFAULT IS CONTINUING AND THE BORROWER IS FINANCIALLY SOLVENT, NO INDEMNITEE MAY SETTLE ANY CLAIM TO BE INDEMNIFIED HEREUNDER
WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF THE BORROWER, WHICH CONSENT WILL NOT BE UNREASONABLY OR UNTIMELY WITHHELD. THIS SECTION 12.03(B) SHALL NOT APPLY WITH RESPECT TO TAXES OTHER THAN ANY TAXES THAT REPRESENT LOSSES, CLAIMS, DAMAGES, ETC. ARISING
FROM ANY NON-TAX CLAIM.  (c) To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount required to be paid by it to any Agent,
the Arrangers or the Issuing Bank under Section 12.03(a) or (b) (and provided that such failure is not due to such Agents, Arrangers or Issuing Banks gross negligence or willful misconduct), each Lender severally agrees
to pay to such Agent, the Arrangers or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such Lenders Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount;
provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against such Agent, the Arrangers or the Issuing Bank in its capacity as such.
 (d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any
Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement
or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the Transactions, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof.  (e) All amounts due under this Section 12.03 shall be payable within 30 days following receipt by the Borrower of a reasonably detailed statement therefor. 
Section 12.04 Successors and Assigns.  (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the
Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), except that (i) the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or
transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section 12.04 (and in no event may any Lender
assign to the Borrower, an Affiliate of the Borrower, a Defaulting Lender or an Affiliate of a Defaulting Lender all or any portion of such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement or all or any portion of its Commitments or the
Loans owing to it hereunder). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the
Issuing Bank that issues any Letter 
   102






 
of Credit), Participants (to the extent provided in Section 12.04(c)) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
Bank and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement. 
(b) (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in Section 12.04(b)(ii), any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or
a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it) with the prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) of: 
(A) the Borrower; provided that no consent of the Borrower shall be required if such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a
Lender, an Approved Fund or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, is to any other assignee; and  (B) the
Administrative Agent; provided that no consent of the Administrative Agent shall be required for an assignment to an assignee that is a Lender immediately prior to giving effect to such assignment. 
(ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions: 
(A) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the
assigning Lenders Commitment or Loans, the amount of the Commitment or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the
Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $10,000,000 unless each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent; provided that no such consent of the Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing;  (B) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning
Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement;  (C) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to
the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500; and  (D) the
assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.  (iii) Subject to Section 12.04(b)(iv) and the acceptance and recording thereof, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party
hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such
Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease

   103






 
to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Section 5.01, Section 5.02, Section 5.03 and Section 12.03). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender
of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 12.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with
Section 12.04(c).  (iv) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower,
shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Maximum Credit Amount of, and principal amount of the Loans and LC
Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
Bank and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for
inspection by the Borrower, the Issuing Bank and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. In connection with any changes to the Register, if necessary, the Administrative Agent will reflect the revisions
on Annex I and forward a copy of such revised Annex I to the Borrower, the Issuing Bank and each Lender.  (v)
Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignees completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and
recordation fee referred to in Section 12.04(b) and any written consent to such assignment required by Section 12.04(b), the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in
the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this Section 12.04(b).  (c) (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a
Participant) in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it); provided that (A) such Lenders
obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank
and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation
shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such
Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver that affects such Participant. In addition such agreement must provide that the Participant be bound by the provisions of Section 12.03.
Subject to Section 12.04(c)(ii), the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 5.01, Section 5.02 and Section 5.03 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the
requirements 
   104






 
under Section 5.03 (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 5.03(f) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender
and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 12.04(b); provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to the provisions of Section 5.04 as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment
pursuant to Section 12.04(b). To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 12.08 as though it were a Lender; provided such Participant agrees to be subject to
Section 4.01(c) as though it were a Lender.  (ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any
greater payment under Section 5.01 or Section 5.03 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater
payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it
enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participants interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the Participant Register). Any such
Participant Register shall be available for inspection by the Administrative Agent at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice; provided that the applicable Lender shall have no obligation to show such
Participant Register to the Borrower except to the extent such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Loan, commitment, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.l03-l(c) of the Treasury
regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this
Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  (d) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in
all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including, without limitation, any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section 12.04(d) shall not apply to
any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as
a party hereto.  (e) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 12.04(e), no transfer or assignment of the
interests or obligations of any Lender or any grant of participations therein shall be permitted if such transfer, assignment or grant would require the Borrower and the Guarantors to file a registration statement with the SEC or to qualify the
Loans under the Blue Sky laws of any state.  Section 12.05 Survival; Revival; Reinstatement.
 (a) All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Borrower herein and in the certificates or other
instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement

   105






 
and the making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent,
any other Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the
principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The
provisions of Section 5.01, Section 5.02, Section 5.03 and Section 12.03 and Article XI shall survive, on an unsecured and non-guaranteed basis, and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any provision hereof or thereof. 
(b) To the extent that any payments on the Indebtedness or proceeds of any collateral are subsequently invalidated, declared to be
fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be repaid to a trustee, debtor in possession, receiver or other Person under any bankruptcy law, common law or equitable cause, then to such extent, the Indebtedness so satisfied shall be revived
and continue as if such payment or proceeds had not been received and the Administrative Agents and the Lenders Liens, security interests, rights, powers and remedies under this Agreement and each Loan Document shall continue in full
force and effect. In such event, each Loan Document shall be automatically reinstated and the Borrower shall take such action as may be reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to effect such reinstatement. 
Section 12.06 Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. 
(a) This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall
constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract.  (b) This Agreement, the
other Loan Documents and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede any and all previous
agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS REPRESENT THE FINAL AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES HERETO AND THERETO AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY
EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES. THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTIES.   (c) Except as provided in Section 6.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received
counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an
executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy or other electronic transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. 
   106






 Section 12.07 Severability. Any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions hereof or thereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction. 
Section 12.08 Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of its
Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations
(of whatsoever kind, including, without limitation, obligations under Swap Agreements) at any time owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower or any Subsidiary against any of and all the obligations of the
Borrower or any Subsidiary owed to such Lender now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and
although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this Section 12.08 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender or its Affiliates may have. 
Section 12.09 GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION; SERVICE OF PROCESS. 
(a) THIS AGREEMENT AND THE NOTES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS EXCEPT TO THE
EXTENT THAT UNITED STATES FEDERAL LAW PERMITS ANY LENDER TO CONTRACT FOR, CHARGE, RECEIVE, RESERVE OR TAKE INTEREST AT THE RATE ALLOWED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE WHERE SUCH LENDER IS LOCATED (AND IN SUCH EVENT, SUCH FEDERAL LAWS SHALL PERTAIN SOLELY
TO SUCH LENDER). CHAPTER 346 OF THE TEXAS FINANCE CODE (WHICH REGULATES CERTAIN REVOLVING CREDIT LOAN ACCOUNTS AND REVOLVING TRI-PARTY ACCOUNTS) SHALL NOT APPLY TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE NOTES. 
(b) ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO THE LOAN DOCUMENTS MAY BE BROUGHT IN THE COURTS OF HARRIS COUNTY IN THE STATE OF TEXAS
OR OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS, AND, BY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT, EACH PARTY HEREBY ACCEPTS FOR ITSELF AND (TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW) IN RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY, GENERALLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY, THE JURISDICTION OF THE AFORESAID COURTS. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OR BASED ON THE GROUNDS OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS, WHICH IT MAY NOW OR
HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE BRINGING OF ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN SUCH RESPECTIVE JURISDICTIONS. THIS SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION IS NON-EXCLUSIVE AND DOES NOT PRECLUDE A PARTY FROM OBTAINING JURISDICTION OVER ANOTHER PARTY IN ANY COURT OTHERWISE
HAVING JURISDICTION. 
   107






 (c) EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO THE SERVICE OF PROCESS OF ANY OF THE AFOREMENTIONED
COURTS IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING BY THE MAILING OF COPIES THEREOF BY REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED MAIL, POSTAGE PREPAID, TO IT AT THE ADDRESS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 12.01 OR SUCH OTHER ADDRESS AS IS SPECIFIED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12.01 (OR
ITS ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION), SUCH SERVICE TO BECOME EFFECTIVE THIRTY (30) DAYS AFTER SUCH MAILING. NOTHING HEREIN SHALL AFFECT THE RIGHT OF A PARTY OR ANY HOLDER OF A NOTE TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW OR TO COMMENCE
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OR OTHERWISE PROCEED AGAINST ANOTHER PARTY IN ANY OTHER JURISDICTION.  (d) EACH PARTY HEREBY
(i) IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT AND FOR ANY COUNTERCLAIM THEREIN; (ii) IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO CLAIM OR RECOVER IN ANY SUCH LITIGATION ANY SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES OTHER THAN, OR IN ADDITION TO, ACTUAL DAMAGES;
(iii) CERTIFIES THAT NO PARTY HERETO NOR ANY REPRESENTATIVE, OR AGENT OF COUNSEL FOR ANY PARTY HERETO HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, OR IMPLIED THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVERS, AND (iv) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, THE LOAN DOCUMENTS AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND THEREBY BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS CONTAINED IN THIS
SECTION 12.09.  Section 12.10 Headings. Article and Section headings and the Table of Contents used herein
are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.  Section 12.11 Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent, the other Agents, the Arrangers, the Issuing Bank, the Lenders and each other party hereto or to any other Loan Document,
agrees to maintain, and agrees to cause each of its Affiliates to maintain, the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates directors, officers, employees
and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information
confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have jurisdiction over it, (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process (and in each such
case, such Person shall, if permitted by law, notify the Borrower of such occurrence as soon as reasonably practicable following the service 
   108






 
of any such process on such Person), (d) to any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any
other Loan Document or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those
of this Section 12.11, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors)
to any Swap Agreement relating to the Borrower and its obligations, (g) with the consent of the Borrower or (h) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this
Section 12.11 or (ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, another Agent, the Arrangers, the Issuing Bank, any Lender or other party hereto on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower. For the purposes of
this Section 12.11, Information means all information received from the Borrower or any Subsidiary relating to the Borrower or any Subsidiary and their businesses, other than any such information that is available to the
Administrative Agent, the other Agents, the Arrangers, the Issuing Bank, any Lender or any other party hereto on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower or a Subsidiary; provided that, in the case of information received
from the Borrower or any Subsidiary after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section 12.11
shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information. 
Section 12.12 Interest Rate Limitation. It is the intention of the parties hereto that each Lender shall conform strictly to
usury laws applicable to it. Accordingly, if the transactions contemplated hereby would be usurious as to any Lender under laws applicable to it (including the laws of the United States of America and the State of Texas or any other jurisdiction
whose laws may be mandatorily applicable to such Lender notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement), then, in that event, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any of the Loan Documents or any agreement entered into in connection
with or as security for the Notes, it is agreed as follows: (i) the aggregate of all consideration which constitutes interest under law applicable to any Lender that is contracted for, taken, reserved, charged or received by such Lender under
any of the Loan Documents or agreements or otherwise in connection with the Notes shall under no circumstances exceed the maximum amount allowed by such applicable law, and any excess shall be canceled automatically and if theretofore paid shall be
credited by such Lender on the principal amount of the Indebtedness (or, to the extent that the principal amount of the Indebtedness shall have been or would thereby be paid in full, refunded by such Lender to the Borrower); and (ii) in the
event that the maturity of the Notes or any other Indebtedness is accelerated by reason of an election of the holder thereof resulting from any Event of Default under this Agreement or otherwise, or in the event of any required or permitted
prepayment, then such consideration that constitutes interest under law applicable to any Lender may never include more than the maximum amount allowed by such applicable law, and excess interest, if any, provided for in this Agreement or otherwise
shall be canceled automatically by such Lender as of the date of such acceleration or prepayment and, if theretofore paid, shall be credited by such Lender on the principal amount of the Indebtedness (or, to the extent that the principal amount of
the Indebtedness shall have been or would thereby be paid in full, refunded by such Lender to the Borrower). All sums paid or agreed to be paid to any Lender for the use,

forbearance or detention of sums due hereunder shall, to the extent permitted by law applicable to such Lender, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread throughout the stated term of the
Loans evidenced by the Notes until payment in full so that the rate or amount of interest on account of any Loans hereunder does not exceed the maximum amount allowed by such applicable law. If at any time and from time to time (i) the amount
of interest payable to any Lender on any date shall be computed at the Highest Lawful Rate applicable to such Lender pursuant to this Section 12.12 and (ii) in respect of any subsequent interest computation period the amount of interest
otherwise payable to such Lender would be less than the amount of interest payable to such Lender computed at the Highest Lawful Rate applicable to such Lender, then the amount of interest payable to such Lender in respect of such subsequent
interest computation period shall continue to be computed at the Highest Lawful Rate applicable to such Lender until the total amount of interest payable to such Lender shall equal the total amount of interest which would have been payable to such
Lender if the total amount of interest had been computed without giving effect to this Section 12.12. To the extent that Chapter 303 of the Texas Finance Code is relevant for the purpose of determining the Highest Lawful Rate applicable to a
Lender, such Lender elects to determine the applicable rate ceiling under such Chapter by the weekly ceiling from time to time in effect. Chapter 346 of the Texas Finance Code does not apply to the Borrowers obligations hereunder. 
Section 12.13 EXCULPATION PROVISIONS. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO SPECIFICALLY AGREES THAT IT HAS A DUTY TO READ THIS

SOME ASPECTS OF THE TRANSACTION AND RELIEVING THE OTHER PARTY OF ITS RESPONSIBILITY FOR SUCH LIABILITY. EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES AND COVENANTS THAT IT WILL NOT CONTEST THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF ANY EXCULPATORY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT AND
THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS ON THE BASIS THAT THE PARTY HAD NO NOTICE OR KNOWLEDGE OF SUCH PROVISION OR THAT THE PROVISION IS NOT CONSPICUOUS.  Section 12.14 Collateral Matters; Swap Agreements. The benefit of the Security Instruments and of the provisions of this Agreement relating to any collateral securing the Indebtedness shall
also extend to and be available to the Secured Swap Parties on a pro rata basis (but subject to the terms of the Loan Documents, including, without limitation, provisions thereof relating to the application and priority of payments to the Persons
entitled thereto) in respect of any Secured Swap Obligations. No Secured Swap Party shall have any voting rights under any Loan Documents as a result of the existence of Secured Swap Obligations owed to it.

extension, rearrangement and increase, and not in extinguishment of the obligations under the Existing Credit Agreement and the notes and other documents related thereto. This Agreement does not constitute a novation of the obligations and
liabilities under the Existing Credit Agreement or evidence repayment of any such obligations and liabilities. All Liens, deeds of trust, mortgages, assignments and security interests securing the Existing Credit Agreement and the obligations
relating thereto are hereby ratified, confirmed, renewed, extended, brought forward and rearranged as security for the Indebtedness. None of the Liens and security interests created pursuant to the Existing Credit Agreement are released.

other Person indemnified under the Existing Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document (as defined therein) at any time prior to the Effective Date; (c) the Indebtedness incurred under the Existing Credit Agreement shall, to the extent
outstanding on the Effective Date, continue outstanding under this Agreement and shall not be deemed to be paid, released, discharged or otherwise satisfied by the execution of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall not constitute a refinancing,
substitution or novation of such Indebtedness or any of the other rights, duties and obligations of the parties hereunder, and the terms Indebtedness, Guaranteed Obligations and Secured Obligations or similar
terms as such terms are used in the Loan Documents shall include the Indebtedness as increased, 
   111






 
amended and restated under this Agreement; (d) the execution, delivery and effectiveness of this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver of any right, power or remedy of the Lenders or the
Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank (as defined therein) under the Existing Credit Agreement, nor constitute a waiver of any covenant, agreement, default or obligation under the Existing Credit Agreement, except to the extent that any such
covenant, agreement, default or obligation is no longer set forth herein or is modified hereby; (e) any and all references to the Existing Credit Agreement in any Security Instrument or other Loan Document shall, without further action of the
parties, be deemed a reference to the Existing Credit Agreement, as amended and restated by this Agreement, and as this Agreement shall be further amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, and any and all references to
the Security Instruments or Loan Documents in any such Security Instruments or any other Loan Documents shall be deemed a reference to the Security Instruments or Loan Documents under the Existing Credit Agreement, as amended and restated by this
Agreement, and as this Agreement shall be further amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time; and (f) the Liens granted pursuant to the Security Instruments to which each of the Borrower or any Subsidiary is a party

 SCHEDULE 7.06  ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS   


1.
 In approximately 2002, predecessors of PennTex Resources Illinois, Inc. (PennTex Illinois) received complaints from local residents of the
cities of Bridgeport and Petrolia, Illinois concerning odors alleged to be emanating from oil wells, emergency pits and facilities located in the companys Lawrence field operations. The complainants alleged that the odors were caused by
hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas. The complainants
alleged that H2S gas emissions from the oil wells and
associated facilities also caused corrosion damages to HVAC systems and other personal property at each of their residences. Each complainant requested compensation for the repair or replacement of personal items located at their residences.
Predecessors of PennTex Illinois entered into settlement agreements with certain of these residents relating to their claims of corrosion damages. On October 7, 2004, a predecessor of PennTex Illinois (then known as ERG Illinois, Inc.) received
a Violation Notice dated October 6, 2004, pursuant to Section 31(a)(1) of the Illinois Environmental Protection Act from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (Illinois EPA) regarding odors allegedly emanating from its
Newell Facility emergency pit or in the general vicinity of the emergency pit. Thereafter, on December 16, 2004, the company received a letter entitled Request to Provide Information Pursuant to the Clean Air Act from the U.S. EPA.
The U.S. EPA requested information necessary to determine whether the operations surrounding the Newell Facility were in compliance with the Illinois State Implementation Plan and the Clean Air Act. On December 27, 2004, ERG Illinois, Inc.
submitted to the Illinois EPA a proposed Compliance Commitment Agreement (CCA) that responded to the October 6, 2004 Violation Notice with a denial of the alleged violations, but accompanied by a proposal to periodically clean the
emergency pit. On January 26, 2005, the Illinois EPA provided a letter to the company indicating that the companys previously submitted CCA had been accepted, thus resolving the Violation Notice. 
On January 28, 2005, PennTex Illinois submitted a response to the U.S. EPAs December 16, 2004
information request. On February 9, 2005, the U.S. EPA requested additional data from PennTex Illinois regarding the quantity of H2S emissions from various sources including the Newell Facility and the wells in and around the city of Bridgeport,
Illinois. In March 2005, PennTex Illinois engaged a third party environmental consulting firm to prepare a Preliminary Action Plan designed to identify and analyze emissions from PennTex Illinois operations and to propose recommendations to
address any identified concerns. A report entitled PAP/Odor Investigation Results with recommendations and a cover letter were sent to the U.S. EPA on July 18, 2005 (the PAP Report). The PAP Report concluded that, for
all wells monitored, PennTex Illinois was in compliance with all known federal, state and local rules and regulations in regard to H2S emissions and exposures. The PAP Report recommended that additional H2S controls, such as the installation of scavenger drums, be implemented
with respect to some of the monitored wells. The PAP Report described the results of high range and low range H2S instrument sampling in the vicinity of the Newell Facility and concluded that no additional operational controls or modifications appeared to be necessary or feasible to further reduce H2S concentrations in the vicinity of the Newell Facility. 
   Schedule 7.06
- 1 





 On March 13, 2006, PennTex Illinois received a second information
request from the U.S. EPA requesting additional information relating to, among other matters, the companys installation of flares and scavenger drums to control H2S emissions at its oil well locations. On March 27, 2006, PennTex Illinois submitted a response to the U.S. EPAs
second information request. In September 2006, the U.S. DOJ and the U.S. EPA initiated an enforcement action seeking mandatory injunctive relief and potential civil penalties from PennTex Illinois and Rex Energy Operating Corp. (Rex
Operating) based on allegations that the companies were violating the Clean Air Act in connection with the release of
H2S and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
in the course of PennTex Illinois oil operations in the Lawrence Field near the towns of Bridgeport and Petrolia, Illinois. Senior management of the companies met with representatives of the U.S. EPA, U.S. DOJ, Illinois EPA and the Agency for
Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) on September 7, 2006, to discuss matters relating to the enforcement action. This meeting had been preceded by certain monitoring of air emissions in the areas surrounding Bridgeport and
Petrolia, Illinois that the U.S. EPA and ATSDR had conducted in May 2006.  In October 2006, PennTex
Illinois and Rex Operating entered into a non-binding agreement in principle with the U.S. EPA to address matters that were the subject of the pending enforcement action. Pursuant to this agreement, the companies agreed to (i) develop and carry
out a detailed and comprehensive written response plan designed to further reduce possible emissions of H2S and VOCs from PennTex Illinois oil wells and associated facilities in the Lawrence Field that were closest to populated areas, (ii) operate and maintain the control measures described in the
response plan in accordance with a written operations and maintenance plan to be approved by the U.S. EPA, (iii) evaluate the effectiveness of the control measures in the Lawrence Field through a monitoring program, and (iv) evaluate the
need for additional control measures at other facilities within the Lawrence Field within 60 days. In April 2007, PennTex Illinois, Rex Operating and the U.S. EPA and U.S. DOJ executed a comprehensive consent decree in which PennTex Illinois and Rex
Operating, without any admission of wrongdoing or liability and without any agreement to pay any civil fine or penalty, agreed to install certain control measures and to implement certain operating and maintenance procedures in the Lawrence Field.
Under the terms of the proposed consent decree, PennTex Illinois and Rex Operating agreed to establish a monitoring protocol that would be designed to facilitate the reduction of possible emissions of H2S and VOCs from PennTex Illinois operations near Bridgeport and
Petrolia. On June 1, 2007, the United States filed a motion for the approval and entry of the proposed consent decree with the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois. On June 6, 2007, the court granted the
United States motion for approval and entry of the proposed consent decree.  PennTex Illinois and Rex Energy began
implementing the control measures required by the consent decree in late 2006, prior to the formal effective date of the decree. Certain primary control measures listed in the decree were installed by the third quarter of 2007. Certain secondary
control measures proposed by PennTex Illinois and Rex Energy and approved by the U.S. EPA and the U.S. DOJ were completed by the end of 2008. Since then, PennTex Illinois and Rex Energy have implemented a number of voluntary control

   Schedule 7.06
- 2 





 
measures in the Lawrence Field, but have not been required to implement additional controls by the U.S. EPA and the U.S. DOJ. In light of four years having passed since the installation of the
last controls required by the consent decree, and based on feedback from the U.S. EPA and the U.S. DOJ, PennTex Illinois and Rex Energy do not expect that additional controls will be required. For calendar year 2013, PennTex Illinois and Rex Energy
have budgeted an insignificant amount (<$200,000) for operating costs to maintain the current controls and minor additional controls for the Lawrence Field and a control project for a facility which is not covered by the consent decree.
  


2.
PennTex Illinois and Rex Energy were defendants in a class action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois. The action
was commenced in October 2006 by plaintiffs Julia Leib and Lisa Thompson, individually and as putative class representatives on behalf of all persons and non-governmental entities that own property or reside on property located in the towns of
Bridgeport and Petrolia, Illinois. The complaint asserted several causes of action, including violation of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Illinois Environmental Protection Act, negligence, private nuisance, trespass, and willful and
wanton misconduct.  In December 2009, PennTex Illinois and Rex Energy entered into a Settlement Agreement and
Release (the Settlement Agreement) with Leib and Thompson, individually and on behalf of a certified class, to settle the class action lawsuit. Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, without any admission of liability, PennTex
Illinois and Rex Energy agreed to pay the class a total of $1.9 million. Pursuant to the terms of a pollution liability policy, $1.0 million of the settlement payment was funded by Rexs insurance carrier. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement,
PennTex Illinois and Rex Energy also agreed to permanently plug four inactive oil wells. In return for the above consideration, each member of the class released all claims against PennTex Illinois and Rex Energy that in any way related to hydrogen
sulfide or other environmental conditions in the class area that were the subject of, or could have been the subject of, the claims alleged in the class action lawsuit. In addition, each class member released any claims related to any future
releases of hydrogen sulfide in the class area on the condition that PennTex Illinois and Rex Energy substantially comply with the terms and conditions of the consent decree describe above. The Settlement Agreement did not provide for a release of
any potential individual claims of other class members since those claims were not the subject of the class action lawsuit. The Settlement Agreement became effective in April 2010.
