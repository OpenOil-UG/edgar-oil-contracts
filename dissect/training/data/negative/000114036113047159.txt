Listed Stock.  If the Common Stock is traded on any established stock exchange or quoted on a national market system, Fair Market Value shall be (A) the closing sales price for the Common Stock as quoted on that stock exchange or system for the date the value is to be determined (the “Value Date”) as reported in The Wall Street Journal or a similar publication, or (B) if the rules of the applicable stock exchange require, the volume-weighted average trading price for five days prior to the date the Board approves the grant of the Award.  If no sales are reported as having occurred on the Value Date, Fair Market Value shall be that closing sales price for the last preceding trading day on which sales of Common Stock is reported as having occurred.  If no sales are reported as having occurred during the five trading days before the Value Date, Fair Market Value shall be the closing bid for Common Stock on the Value Date.  If the Common Stock is listed on multiple exchanges or systems, Fair Market Value shall be based on sales or bids on the primary exchange or system on which Common Stock is traded or quoted.  If the rules of any applicable stock exchange or system require a different method of calculating Fair Market Value, then such method as is required by those rules;











(ii)
Stock Quoted by Securities Dealer.  If Common Stock is regularly quoted by a recognized securities dealer but selling prices are not reported on any established stock exchange or quoted on a national market system, Fair Market Value shall be the mean between the high bid and low asked prices on the Value Date.  If no prices are quoted for the Value Date, Fair Market Value shall be the mean between the high bid and low asked prices on the last preceding trading day on which any bid and asked prices were quoted;











(iii)
No Established Market.  If Common Stock is not traded on any established stock exchange or quoted on a national market system and is not quoted by a recognized securities dealer, the Administrator will determine Fair Market Value in good faith.  The Administrator will consider the following factors, and any others it considers significant, in determining Fair Market Value: (A) the price at which other securities of the Company have been issued to purchasers other than Employees, Directors, or Consultants; (B) the Company’s net worth, prospective earning power, dividend-paying capacity, and non-operating assets, if any; and (C) any other relevant factors, including the economic outlook for the Company and the Company’s industry, the Company’s position in that industry, the Company’s goodwill and other intellectual property, and the values of securities of other businesses in the same industry;












(iv)
Additional Valuation.  For publicly traded companies, any valuation method permitted under Section 20.2031-2 of the Estate Tax Regulations; or











(v)
Non-Publicly Traded Stock.  For non-publicly traded stock, the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock at the Grant Date based on an average of the Fair Market Values as of such date set forth in the opinions of completely independent and well-qualified experts (the Participant’s status as a majority or minority shareholder may be taken into consideration).







Regardless of whether the Common Stock offered under the Award is publicly traded, a good faith attempt under this definition shall not be met unless the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the Grant Date is determined with regard to nonlapse restrictions (as defined in Section 1.83-3(h) of the Treasury Regulations) and without regard to lapse restrictions (as defined in Section 1.83-3(i) of the Treasury Regulations);

Option Term.  Each Option and all rights or obligations thereunder shall expire on such date as shall be determined by the Administrator, but not later than ten years after the Grant Date (five years in the case of an Incentive Stock Option when the Optionee beneficially owns more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary (a “Ten Percent Stockholder”), as determined with reference to Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act), and shall be subject to earlier termination as hereinafter provided;











(c)
Exercise Price.  The Exercise Price of any Option shall be determined by the Administrator when the Option is granted, at such Exercise Price as may be determined by the Administrator in the Administrator’s sole and absolute discretion; provided, however, that the Exercise Price may not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the Grant Date with respect to any Incentive Stock Options which are granted and, provided further, that the Exercise Price of any Incentive Stock Option granted to a Ten Percent Stockholder shall not be less than 110% of the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the Grant Date.  Payment for the Shares purchased shall be made in accordance with Section 16 of this Plan.  The Administrator is authorized to issue Options, whether Incentive Stock Options or Non-qualified Stock Options, at an option price lower than or in excess of the Fair Market Value on the Grant Date, to determine the terms and conditions of any Award granted under the Plan, including, but not limited to, the exercise price, grant price or purchase price, any restrictions or limitations on the Award, any schedule for lapse of forfeiture restrictions or restrictions on the exercisability of the Award, and acceleration or waivers thereof, based in each case on such considerations as the Committee in its sole discretion determines that is not inconsistent with any rule or regulation under any tax or securities laws or includes an alternative right that does not disqualify an Incentive Stock Option under applicable regulations;











(d)
Method of Exercise.  Options may be exercised only by delivery to the Company of a stock option exercise agreement (the “Exercise Agreement”) in a form approved by the Administrator (which need not be the same for each Grantee), stating the number of Shares being purchased, the restrictions imposed on the Shares purchased under such Exercise Agreement, if any, and such representations and agreements regarding the Grantee’s investment intent and access to information and other matters, if any, as may be required or desirable by the Company to comply with applicable securities laws, together with payment in full of the exercise price for the number of Shares being purchased;











(e)
Exercise After Certain Events.











 

(i)


Termination of Continuous Services.











 

(A)


Options.











 

(I)


Termination of Continuous Services.  If for any reason other than Disability or death, a Grantee terminates Continuous Services with the Company or a Subsidiary, vested Options held at the date of such termination may be exercised, in whole or in part, either (i) at any time within three months after the date of such termination, or (ii) during any greater or lesser period as specified in the Award Agreement or (iii) during any greater or lesser period as may be determined by the Administrator, in its sole and absolute discretion, prior the date of such termination (but in no event after the earlier of (A) the expiration date of the Option as set forth in the Award Agreement and (B) ten years from the Grant Date (five years for a Ten Percent Stockholder if the Option is an Incentive Stock Option)).











 

(II)


Continuation of Services as Consultant/Advisor.  If a Grantee granted an Incentive Stock Option terminates employment but continues as a Consultant (no termination of Continuous Services), the Grantee need not exercise an Incentive Stock Option within either of the termination periods provided for immediately hereinabove but shall be entitled to exercise, in whole or in part, either (i) at any time within three months after the then date of termination of Continuous Services to the Company or a Subsidiary, or (ii) during any greater or lesser period as specified in the Award Agreement or (iii) during any greater or lesser period as may be determined by the Administrator, in its sole and absolute discretion, prior the date of such then termination of Continuous Services to the Company or the Subsidiary (one year in the event of Disability or death) (but in no event after the earlier of (A) the expiration date of the Option as set forth in the Award Agreement and (B) ten years from the Grant Date (five years for a Ten Percent Stockholder if the Option is an Incentive Stock Option)).  However, if the Grantee does not exercise within three months of termination of employment, pursuant to Section 422 of the Code the Option shall not qualify as an Incentive Stock Option.











 

(B)


Disability and Death.  If a Grantee becomes Disabled while rendering Continuous Services to the Company or a Subsidiary, or dies while employed by the Company or Subsidiary or within three months thereafter, vested Options then held may be exercised by the Grantee, the Grantee’s personal representative, or by the person to whom the Option is transferred by the laws of descent and distribution, in whole or in part, at any time within one year after the termination because of the Disability or death or any lesser period specified in the Award Agreement (but in no event after the earlier of (i) the expiration date of the Option as set forth in the Award Agreement, and (ii) ten years from the Grant Date (five years for a Ten Percent Stockholder if the Option is an Incentive Stock Option).









Limitations on Grant of Incentive Stock Options







7.3

(a)


Threshold.  The aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the Grant Date) of the Shares for which Incentive Stock Options may first become exercisable by any Grantee during any calendar year under this Plan, together with that of Shares subject to Incentive Stock Options first exercisable by such Grantee under any other plan of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, shall not exceed $100,000.  For purposes of this Section 7.3(a), all Options in excess of the $100,000 threshold shall be treated as Non-Qualified Stock Options notwithstanding the designation as Incentive Stock Options.  For this purpose, Options shall be taken into account in the order in which they were granted, and the Fair Market Value of the Shares shall be determined as of the date the Option with respect to such Shares is granted.












(b)
Compliance with Section 422 of the Code.  There shall be imposed in the Award Agreement relating to Incentive Stock Options such terms and conditions as are required in order that the Option be an “incentive stock option” as that term is defined in Section 422 of the Code.











(c)
Requirement of Employment.  No Incentive Stock Option may be granted to any person who is not an Employee of the Company or a Parent or Subsidiary of the Company.

12.
STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS







Awards of SARs




12.1                                     An SAR is an award to receive a number of Shares (which may consist of Restricted Stock), or cash, or Shares and cash, as determined by the Administrator in accordance with Section 12.4 below, for services rendered to the Company.  A SAR may be awarded pursuant to an Award Agreement that shall be in such form (which need not be the same for each Grantee) as the Administrator shall from time to time approve, and shall comply with and be subject to the terms and conditions of this Plan.  A SAR may vary from Grantee to Grantee and between groups of Grantees, and may be based upon performance objectives (See Performance Goals in Section 14.4).




Term




12.2                                     The term of a SAR shall be set forth in the Award Agreement as determined by the Administrator.





Exercise




12.3                                   A Grantee desiring to exercise a SAR shall give written notice of such exercise to the Company, which notice shall state the proportion of Shares and cash that the Grantee desires to receive pursuant to the SAR exercised, subject to the discretion of the Administrator.  Upon receipt of the notice from the Grantee, subject to the Administrator’s election to pay cash as provided in Section 12.4 below, the Company shall deliver to the person entitled thereto (i) a certificate or certificates for Shares and/or (ii) a cash payment, in accordance with Section 12.4 below.  The date the Company receives written notice of such exercise hereunder is referred to in this Section 12 as the “exercise date”.




Number of Shares or Amount of Cash




12.4                                    Subject to the discretion of the Administrator to substitute cash for Shares, or some portion of the Shares for cash, the amount of Shares that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of a SAR shall be determined by dividing: (i) the total number of Shares as to which the SAR is exercised, multiplied by the amount by which the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the exercise date exceeds the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant of the SAR; by (ii) the Fair Market Value of a Share on the exercise date; provided, however, that fractional Shares shall not be issued and in lieu thereof, a cash adjustment shall be paid.  In lieu of issuing Shares upon the exercise of a SAR, the Administrator in its sole discretion may elect to pay the cash equivalent of the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the exercise date for any or all of the Shares that would otherwise be issuable upon exercise of the SAR.




Effect of Exercise




12.5                                     A partial exercise of a SAR shall not affect the right to exercise the remaining SAR from time to time in accordance with this Plan and the applicable Award Agreement with respect to the remaining shares subject to the SAR.

 

Forfeiture




12.6                                    In the case of an event of forfeiture pursuant to the Award Agreement, including failure to satisfy any restriction period or a performance objective, any SAR that has not vested prior to the date of termination shall automatically expire, and all of the rights, title and interest of the Grantee thereunder shall be forfeited in their entirety.







13.
DIVIDEND EQUIVALENT RIGHT







A dividend equivalent right is an Award entitling the recipient to receive credits based on cash distributions that would have been paid on the Shares specified in the dividend equivalent right (or other Award to which it relates) if such Shares had been issued to and held by the recipient (a “Dividend Equivalent Right”).  A Dividend Equivalent Right may be granted hereunder to any Grantee as a component of another Award or as a freestanding Award.  The terms and conditions of Dividend Equivalent Right shall be specified in the grant.  Dividend equivalents credited to the holder of a Dividend Equivalent Right may be paid currently or may be deemed to be reinvested in additional Shares, which may thereafter accrue additional equivalents.  Any such reinvestment shall be at Fair Market Value on the date of reinvestment. Dividend Equivalent Rights may be settled in cash or Shares or a combination thereof, in a single instalment or instalments, all determined in the sole discretion of the Administrator.  A Dividend Equivalent Right granted as a component of another Award may provide that such Dividend Equivalent Right shall be settled upon exercise, settlement, or payment of, or lapse of restrictions on, such other Award, and that such Dividend Equivalent Right shall expire or be forfeited or annulled under the same conditions as such other Award.  A Dividend Equivalent Right granted as a component of another Award may also contain terms and conditions different from such other Award.








14.
TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF AWARDS







In General




14.1                                    Subject to the terms of the Plan and Applicable Laws, the Administrator shall determine the provisions, terms, and conditions of each Award including, but not limited to, the Award vesting schedule, repurchase provisions, rights of first refusal, forfeiture provisions, form of payment (cash, Shares, or other consideration) upon settlement of the Award, payment contingencies, and satisfaction of any performance criteria.




Term of Award




14.2                                     The term of each Award shall be the term stated in the Award Agreement.




Transferability

 






14.3


(a)

Limits on Transfer.  No right or interest of a Grantee in any unexercised or restricted Award may be pledged, encumbered or hypothecated to or in favor of any party other than to the Company or a Related Entity or Affiliate.  No Award shall be sold, assigned, transferred or disposed of by a Grantee other than by the laws of descent and distribution or, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, pursuant to a domestic relations order that would satisfy Section 414(p)(1)(A) of the Code if such Section applied to an Award under the Plan; provided, however, that the Administrator may (but need not) permit other transfers where the Administrator concludes that such transferability (i) does not result in accelerated taxation or other adverse tax consequences, (ii) does not cause any Option intended to be an Incentive Stock Option to fail to be described in Section 422(b) of the Code, and (iii) is otherwise appropriate and desirable, taking into account any factors deemed relevant, including, without limitation, state or federal tax or securities laws applicable to transferable Awards.




 






(b)
Beneficiaries.  Notwithstanding Section 14.3(a), a Grantee may, in the manner determined by the Administrator, designate a beneficiary to exercise the rights of the Grantee and to receive any distribution with respect to any Award upon the Grantee’s death.  A beneficiary, legal guardian, legal representative or other person claiming any rights under the Plan is subject to all terms and conditions of the Plan and any Award Agreement applicable to the Grantee, except to the extent the Plan and such Award Agreement otherwise provide, and to any additional restrictions deemed necessary or appropriate by the Administrator.  If no beneficiary has been designated or survives the Grantee, payment shall be made to the Grantee’s estate. Subject to the foregoing, a beneficiary designation may be changed or revoked by a Grantee at any time, provided the change or revocation is filed with the Administrator.







Performance Goals




14.4                                    In order to preserve the deductibility of an Award under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Administrator may determine that any Award granted pursuant to this Plan to a Grantee that is or is expected to become a Covered Employee shall be determined solely on the basis of (a) the achievement by the Company or Subsidiary of a specified target return, or target growth in return, on equity or assets, (b) the Company’s stock price, (c) the Company’s total shareholder return (stock price appreciation plus reinvested dividends) relative to a defined comparison group or target over a specific performance period, (d) the achievement by the Company or a Parent or Subsidiary, or a business unit of any such entity, of a specified target, or target growth in, net income, earnings per share, earnings before income and taxes, and earnings before income, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or (e) any combination of the goals set forth in (a) through (d) above.  If an Award is made on such basis, the Administrator shall establish goals prior to the beginning of the period for which such performance goal relates (or such later date as may be permitted under Section 162(m) of the Code or the regulations thereunder but not later than 90 days after commencement of the period of services to which the performance goal relates), and the Administrator has the right for any reason to reduce (but not increase) the Award, notwithstanding the achievement of a specified goal.  Any payment of an Award granted with performance goals shall be conditioned on the written certification of the Administrator in each case that the performance goals and any other material conditions were satisfied.





In addition, to the extent that Section 409A is applicable, (i) performance-based compensation shall also be contingent on the satisfaction of pre-established organizational or individual performance criteria relating to a performance period of at least 12 consecutive months in which the Eligible Participant performs services and (ii) performance goals shall be established not later than 90 calendar days after the beginning of any performance period to which the performance goal relates, provided that the outcome is substantially uncertain at the time the criteria are established.




Acceleration




14.5                                     The Administrator may, in its sole discretion (but subject to the limitations of and compliance with Section 409A of the Code and Section 14.7 in connection therewith), at any time (including, without limitation, prior to, coincident with or subsequent to a Change of Control) determine that (a) all or a portion of a Grantee’s Awards shall become fully or partially exercisable, and/or (b) all or a part of the restrictions on all or a portion of the outstanding Awards shall lapse, in each case, as of such date as the Administrator may, in its sole discretion, declare.  The Administrator may discriminate among Grantees and among Awards granted to a Grantee in exercising its discretion pursuant to this Section 14.5.




Compliance with Section 162(m) of the Code




14.6                                     Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, if the Administrator determines that compliance with Section 162(m) of the Code is required or desired, all Awards granted under this Plan to Named Executive Officers shall comply with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code.  In addition, in the event that changes are made to Section 162(m) of the Code to permit greater flexibility with respect to any Award or Awards under this Plan, the Administrator may make any adjustments it deems appropriate.

 

Compliance with Section 409A of the Code




14.7                                    Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, if any provision of this Plan or an Award Agreement contravenes any regulations or Treasury guidance promulgated under Section 409A of the Code or could cause an Award to be subject to the interest and penalties under Section 409A of the Code, such provision of this Plan or any Award Agreement shall be modified to maintain, to the maximum extent practicable, the original intent of the applicable provision without violating the provisions of Section 409A of the Code.  In addition, in the event that changes are made to Section 409A of the Code to permit greater flexibility with respect to any Award under this Plan, the Administrator may make any adjustments it deems appropriate.




Section 280G of the Code




14.8                                     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, unless expressly provided otherwise in the Award Agreement, if the right to receive or benefit from an Award under this Plan, either alone or together with payments that a Grantee has a right to receive from the Company, would constitute a “parachute payment” (as defined in Section 280G of the Code), all such payments shall be reduced to the largest amount that shall result in no portion being subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code.




Exercise of Award Following Termination of Continuous Service




14.9                                    An Award may not be exercised after the termination date of such Award set forth in the Award Agreement and may be exercised following the termination of a Grantee’s Continuous Service only to the extent provided in the Award Agreement.  Where the Award Agreement permits a Grantee to exercise an Award following the termination of the Grantee’s Continuous Service for a specified period, the Award shall terminate to the extent not exercised on the last day of the specified period or the last day of the original term of the Award, whichever occurs first.





Cancellation of Awards




14.10                                 In the event a Grantee’s Continuous Services has been terminated for “Cause”, he or she shall immediately forfeit all rights to any and all Awards outstanding.  The determination that termination was for Cause shall be final and conclusive.  In making its determination, the Board shall give the Grantee an opportunity to appear and be heard at a hearing before the full Board and present evidence on the Grantee’s behalf.  Should any provision to this Section 14.10. be held to be invalid or illegal, such illegality shall not invalidate the whole of this Section 14, but, rather, this Plan shall be construed as if it did not contain the illegal part or narrowed to permit its enforcement, and the rights and obligations of the parties shall be construed and enforced accordingly.







15.
ADDITIONAL TERMS IF THE COMPANY BECOMES LISTED ON A STOCK EXCHANGE







15.1                                    In the event the Shares become listed on a stock exchange, and to the extent required by the rules of such stock exchange, then the following terms and conditions shall apply to an Award in addition to those contained herein, as applicable:








(a)
the exercise price of an Award must not be lower than 100% of the Fair Market Value (without discount) of the Shares on the stock exchange at the time the Award is granted;











(b)
the number of securities issuable to Insiders, at any time, under all of the Company’s security based compensation arrangements (whether entered into prior to or subsequent to such listing), cannot exceed 20% of the Company’s total issued and outstanding Common Stock, unless the Company obtains Disinterested Shareholder Approval; and











(c)
the number of securities issued to Insiders, within any one year period, under all of the Company’s security based compensation arrangements (whether entered into prior to or subsequent to such listing), cannot exceed 20% of the issued and outstanding Common Stock, unless the Company obtains Disinterested Shareholder Approval.










16.
PAYMENT FOR SHARE PURCHASES







Payment




16.1                                    Payment for Shares purchased pursuant to this Plan may be made:








(a)
Cash.  By cash, cashier’s check or wire transfer or, at the discretion of the Administrator expressly for the Grantee and where permitted by law as follows:











(b)
Surrender of Shares.  By surrender of shares of Common Stock of the Company that have been owned by the Grantee for more than six months, or lesser period if the surrender of shares is otherwise exempt from Section 16 of the Exchange Act, (and, if such shares were purchased from the Company by use of a promissory note, such note has been fully paid with respect to such shares);











(c)
Deemed Net-Stock Exercise.  By forfeiture of Shares equal to the value of the exercise price pursuant to a “deemed net-stock exercise” by requiring the Grantee to accept that number of Shares determined in accordance with the following formula, rounded down to the nearest whole integer:


















 

where:








a  =
net Shares to be issued to Grantee;











b  =
number of Awards being exercised;











c  =
Fair Market Value of a Share; and











d  =
Exercise price of the Awards;











(d)
Cashless Exercise.  By a “cashless exercise”, in which event the Company shall issue to the Grantee the number of Shares of Common Stock determined as follows:

















 

where:








a  =
the net Shares to be issued to Grantee;











b  =
the number of Awards being exercised;











c  =
the average of the “Closing Sale Prices” of the Shares of Common Stock (as reported by Bloomberg Financial Markets) for at least the two trading days ending on the date immediately preceding the Exercise Date; and











d  =
the Exercise price of the Award.







For purposes of such an Award, “Closing Sale Price” means, for any security as of any date, the last trade price for such security on the principal securities exchange or trading market for such security, as reported by Bloomberg Financial Markets, or, if such exchange or trading market begins to operate on an extended hours basis and does not designate the last trade price, then the last trade price of such security prior to 4:00 p.m., New York City time, as reported by Bloomberg Financial Markets, or if the foregoing do not apply, the last trade price of such security in the over-the-counter market on the electronic bulletin board for such security as reported by Bloomberg Financial Markets, or, if no last trade price is reported for such security by Bloomberg Financial Markets, the average of the bid prices, or the ask prices, respectively, of any market makers for such security as reported in the “pink sheets” by Pink Sheets LLC.  If the Closing Sale Price cannot be calculated for a security on a particular date on any of the foregoing bases, the Closing Sale Price of such security on such date shall be the fair market value as mutually determined by the Company and the Grantee.  If the Company and the Grantee are unable to agree upon the fair market value of such security, then the Company shall, within two business days submit via facsimile (a) the disputed determination of the Closing Sale Price to an independent, reputable investment bank selected by the Company and approved by the Grantee or (b) the disputed arithmetic calculation of the Shares of Common Stock to the Company's independent, outside accountant.  The Company shall cause at its expense the investment bank or the accountant, as the case may be, to perform the determinations or calculations and notify the Company and the Grantee of the results no later than ten business days from the time it receives the disputed determinations or calculations.  Such investment bank’s or accountant's determination or calculation, as the case may be, shall be binding upon all parties absent demonstrable error.  All such determinations shall be appropriately adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination or other similar transaction during the applicable calculation period.  For purposes of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, it is intended, understood and acknowledged that the Shares of Common Stock issued in a cashless exercise transaction shall be deemed to have been acquired by the Grantee, and the holding period for the shares shall be deemed to have commenced, on the date the Award was originally issued (provided that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission continues to take the position that such treatment is proper at the time of such exercise); or









(e)
Broker-Assisted.  By delivering a properly executed exercise notice to the Company together with a copy of irrevocable instructions to a broker to deliver promptly to the Company the amount of sale or loan proceeds necessary to pay the exercise price and the amount of any required tax or other withholding obligations.







Combination of Methods




16.2                                     By any combination of the foregoing methods of payment or any other consideration or method of payment as shall be permitted by applicable corporate law.







17.
WITHHOLDING TAXES







Withholding Generally




17.1                                    Whenever Shares are to be issued in satisfaction of Awards granted under this Plan or Shares are forfeited pursuant to a deemed net-stock exercise, the Company may require the Grantee to remit to the Company an amount sufficient to satisfy the foreign, federal, state, provincial, or local income and employment tax withholding obligations, including, without limitation, on exercise of an Award.  When, under applicable tax laws, a Grantee incurs tax liability in connection with the exercise or vesting of any Award, the disposition by a Grantee or other person of an Award or an Option prior to satisfaction of the holding period requirements of Section 422 of the Code, or upon the exercise of a Non-Qualified Stock Option, the Company shall have the right to require such Grantee or such other person to pay by cash, or check payable to the Company, the amount of any such withholding with respect to such transactions.  Any such payment must be made promptly when the amount of such obligation becomes determinable.




Stock for Withholding




17.2                                     To the extent permissible under applicable tax, securities and other laws, the Administrator may, in its sole discretion and upon such terms and conditions as it may deem appropriate, permit a Grantee to satisfy his or her obligation to pay any withholding tax, in whole or in part, with Shares up to an amount not greater than the Company’s minimum statutory withholding rate for federal and state tax purposes, including payroll taxes, that are applicable to such supplemental taxable income.  The Administrator may exercise its discretion, by (i) directing the Company to apply Shares to which the Grantee is entitled as a result of the exercise of an Award, or (ii) delivering to the Company Shares that have been owned by the Grantee for more than six months, unless the delivery of Shares is otherwise exempt from Section 16 of the Exchange Act.  A Grantee who has made an election pursuant to this Section 17.2 may satisfy his or her withholding obligation only with Shares that are not subject to any repurchase, forfeiture, unfulfilled vesting or other similar requirements.  The Shares so applied or delivered for the withholding obligation shall be valued at their Fair Market Value as of the date of measurement of the amount of income subject to withholding.

ADJUSTMENTS UPON CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION







In General




18.1                                     Subject to any required action by the shareholders of the Company, the number of Shares covered by each outstanding Award, and the number of Shares which have been authorized for issuance under the Plan but as to which no Awards have yet been granted or which have been returned to the Plan, the exercise or purchase price of each such outstanding Award, as well as any other terms that the Administrator determines require adjustment shall be proportionately adjusted for (i) any increase or decrease in the number of issued Shares resulting from a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification of the Shares, or (ii) any other increase or decrease in the number of issued Shares effected without receipt of consideration by the Company; provided, however that conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be deemed to have been effected without receipt of consideration. The Administrator shall make the appropriate adjustments to (i) the maximum number and/or class of securities issuable under this Plan; and (ii) the number and/or class of securities and the exercise price per Share in effect under each outstanding Award in order to prevent the dilution or enlargement of benefits thereunder; provided, however, that the number of Shares subject to any Award shall always be a whole number and the Administrator shall make such adjustments as are necessary to insure Awards of whole Shares. Such adjustment shall be made by the Administrator and its determination shall be final, binding and conclusive.




Company’s Right to Effect Changes in Capitalization




18.2                                     The existence of outstanding Awards shall not affect the Company’s right to effect adjustments, recapitalizations, reorganizations or other changes in its or any other corporation’s capital structure or business, any merger or consolidation, any issuance of bonds, debentures, preferred or prior preference stock ahead of or affecting the Shares, the dissolution or liquidation of the Company’s or any other corporation’s assets or business or any other corporate act whether similar to the events described above or otherwise.

Company is Not the Survivor




19.1                                     Subject to Section 19.3 and except as may otherwise be provided in an Award Agreement, the Administrator shall have the authority, in its absolute discretion, exercisable either in advance of any actual or anticipated Corporate Transaction, Change in Control or Related Entity Disposition in which the Company is not the surviving corporation, or at the time of an actual Corporate Transaction, Change in Control or Related Entity Disposition in which the Company is not the surviving corporation (a) to cancel each outstanding Award upon payment in cash to the Grantee of the amount by which any cash and the Fair Market Value of any other property which the Grantee would have received as consideration for the Shares covered by the Award if the Award had been exercised before such Corporate Transaction, Change in Control or Related Entity Disposition exceeds the exercise price of the Award, or (b) to negotiate to have such Award assumed by the surviving corporation.  The determination as to whether the Company is the surviving corporation is at the sole and absolute discretion of the Administrator.




In addition to the foregoing, in the event of a dissolution or liquidation of the Company, or a Corporate Transaction or Related Entity Disposition in which the Company is not the surviving corporation, the Administrator, in its absolute discretion, may accelerate the time within which each outstanding Award may be exercised.  Section 19.3 shall control with respect to any acceleration in vesting in the event of Change of Control.




The Administrator shall also have the authority:








(a)
to release the Awards from restrictions on transfer and repurchase or forfeiture rights of such Awards on such terms and conditions as the Administrator may specify; and











(b)
to condition any such Award’s vesting and exercisability or release from such limitations upon the subsequent termination of the Continuous Service of the Grantee within a specified period following the effective date of the Corporate Transaction, Change in Control or Related Entity Disposition.








Effective upon the consummation of a Corporate Transaction, Change in Control or Related Entity Disposition governed by this Section 19.1, all outstanding Awards under this Plan not exercised by the Grantee or assumed by the successor corporation shall terminate.




Company is the Survivor

Change in Control




19.3                                    If there is a Change of Control, all outstanding Awards shall fully vest immediately upon the Company’s public announcement of such a Change of Control.







20.
PRIVILEGES OF STOCK OWNERSHIP







No Grantee shall have any of the rights of a stockholder with respect to any Shares until the Shares are issued to the Grantee.  After Shares are issued to the Grantee, the Grantee shall be a stockholder and have all the rights of a stockholder with respect to such Shares, including the right to vote and receive all dividends or other distributions made or paid with respect to such Shares; provided, that if such Shares are Restricted Stock, then any new, additional or different securities the Grantee may become entitled to receive with respect to such Shares by virtue of a stock dividend, stock split or any other change in the corporate or capital structure of the Company shall be subject to the same restrictions as the Restricted Stock.  The Company shall issue (or cause to be issued) such stock certificate promptly upon exercise of the Award.







21.
RESTRICTION ON SHARES







At the discretion of the Administrator, the Company may reserve to itself and/or its assignee(s) in the Award Agreement that the Grantee not dispose of the Shares for a specified period of time, or that the Shares are subject to a right of first refusal or a right to repurchase by the Company at the Shares’ Fair Market Value at the time of sale.  The terms and conditions of any such rights or other restrictions shall be set forth in the Award Agreement evidencing the Award.

SECURITIES LAW AND OTHER REGULATORY COMPLIANCE







Compliance With Applicable Law




24.1                                    An Award shall not be effective unless such Award is in compliance with all applicable federal and state securities laws, rules and regulations of any governmental body, and the requirements of any stock exchange or automated quotation system upon which the Shares may then be listed or quoted, as they are in effect on the Grant Date and also on the date of exercise or other issuance.  Notwithstanding any other provision in this Plan, the Company shall have no obligation to issue or deliver certificates for Shares under this Plan prior to (i) obtaining any approvals from governmental agencies that the Company determines are necessary or advisable; and/or (ii) completion of any registration or other qualification of such Shares under any state or federal laws or rulings of any governmental body that the Company determines to be necessary or advisable.  The Company shall be under no obligation to register the Shares with the Securities Exchange Commission or to effect compliance with the registration, qualification or listing requirements of any state securities laws, stock exchange or automated quotation system, and the Company shall have no liability for any inability or failure to do so.  Evidences of ownership of Shares acquired pursuant to an Award shall bear any legend required by, or useful for purposes of compliance with, applicable securities laws, this Plan or the Award Agreement.




During any time when the Company has a class of equity security registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, it is the intent of the Company that Awards pursuant to this Plan and the exercise of Awards granted hereunder shall qualify for the exemption provided by Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.  To the extent that any provision of this Plan or action by the Board or the Administrator does not comply with the requirements of Rule 16b-3, it shall be deemed inoperative to the extent permitted by law and deemed advisable by the Board or the Administrator, and shall not affect the validity of this Plan.  In the event that Rule 16b-3 is revised or replaced, the Administrator may exercise its discretion to modify this Plan in any respect necessary to satisfy the requirements of, or to take advantage of any features of, the revised exemption or its replacement.




Investment Representation




24.2                                    As a condition to the exercise of an Award, the Company may require the person exercising such Award to represent and warrant at the time of any such exercise that the Shares are being purchased only for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such Shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation is required by any Applicable Laws.

 




25.
NO OBLIGATION TO EMPLOY




 

Nothing in this Plan or any Award granted under this Plan shall confer or be deemed to confer on any Grantee any right to continue in the employ of, or to continue any other relationship with, the Company or to limit in any way the right of the Company to terminate such Grantee’s employment or other relationship at any time, with or without Cause.







26.
EFFECTIVE DATE AND TERM OF PLAN

27.
SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL







This Plan shall be subject to approval by the shareholders of the Company within 12 months from the date the Plan is adopted by the Company’s Board for any and all intended Incentive Stock Options granted hereunder.  Such shareholder approval shall be obtained in the degree and manner required under Applicable Laws.  The Administrator may grant Awards under this Plan prior to approval by the shareholders, however, until such approval is obtained, all Option Awards granted under this Plan shall be deemed Non-Qualified Stock Options.  In the event that shareholder approval is not obtained within the 12 month period provided above, all Incentive Stock Option Awards previously granted under this Plan shall be deemed Non-Qualified Stock Options.








28.
AMENDMENT, SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF THIS PLAN OR AWARDS




 

The Board may amend, suspend or terminate this Plan at any time and for any reason.  To the extent necessary to comply with Applicable Laws, the Company shall obtain shareholder approval of any Plan amendment in such a manner and to such a degree as required.  Shareholder approval shall be required for the following types of amendments to this Plan: (i) any change to those persons who are entitled to become participants under the Plan which would have the potential of broadening or increasing Insider participation; or (ii) the addition of any form of financial assistance or amendment to a financial assistance provision which is more favourable to Grantees.




Further, the Board may, in its discretion, determine that any amendment should be effective only if approved by the shareholders even if such approval is not expressly required by this Plan or by law.  No Award may be granted during any suspension of this Plan or after termination of this Plan.




Any amendment, suspension or termination of this Plan shall not affect Awards already granted, and such Awards shall remain in full force and effect as if this Plan had not been amended, suspended or terminated, unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Grantee and the Administrator, which agreement must be in writing and signed by the Grantee and the Company.  At any time and from time to time, the Administrator may amend, modify, or terminate any outstanding Award or Award Agreement without approval of the Grantee; provided, however, that subject to the applicable Award Agreement, no such amendment, modification or termination shall, without the Grantee’s consent, reduce or diminish the value of such Award determined as if the Award had been exercised, vested, cashed in or otherwise settled on the date of such amendment or termination.




Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the Administrator shall have broad authority to amend this Plan or any outstanding Award under this Plan without approval of the Grantee to the extent necessary or desirable: (i) to comply with, or take into account changes in, applicable tax laws, securities laws, accounting rules and other applicable laws, rules and regulations; or (ii) to ensure that an Award is not subject to interest and penalties under Section 409A of the Code or the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code.




Further, notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, and subject to Applicable Law, the Administrator may, in its absolute discretion, amend or modify this Plan: (i) to make amendments which are of a “housekeeping” or clerical nature; (ii) to change the vesting provisions of an Award granted hereunder, as applicable; (iii) to change the termination provision of an Award granted hereunder, as applicable, which does not entail an extension beyond the original expiry date of such Award; and (iv) the addition of a cashless exercise feature, payable in cash or securities, which provides for a full deduction of the number of underlying securities from the Maximum Number.







29.
RESERVATION OF SHARES







The Company, during the term of this Plan, shall at all times reserve and keep available such number of Shares as shall be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of this Plan.




The Shares to be issued hereunder upon exercise of an Award may be either authorized but unissued; supplied to the Plan through acquisitions of Shares on the open market; Shares forfeited back to the Plan; Shares surrendered in payment of the exercise price of an Award; or Shares withheld for payment of applicable employment taxes and/or withholding obligations resulting from the exercise of an Award.




The inability of the Company to obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Company’s counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained.








30.
EXCHANGE AND BUYOUT OF AWARDS







The Administrator may, at any time or from time to time, authorize the Company, with the consent of the respective Grantees, to issue new Awards in exchange for the surrender and cancellation of any or all outstanding Awards.  The Administrator may at any time buy from a Grantee an Award previously granted with payment in cash, Shares (including Restricted Stock) or other consideration, based on such terms and conditions as the Administrator and the Grantee may agree.







31.

The Plan is not a “Retirement Plan” or “Welfare Plan” under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.

7.                                          Settlement of Deferred Stock Units.  Subject to Section 8, each Deferred Stock Unit shall be paid and settled by the issuance of Restricted or unrestricted Shares in accordance with the Award Agreement and if such settlement is subject to Section 409A of the Code only upon any one or more of the following as provided for in the Award Agreement:

9.                                           Issuance of Stock Certificates.  A stock certificate or certificates shall be registered and issued in the name of the holder of Deferred Stock Units and delivered to such holder as soon as practicable after such Deferred Stock Units have become payable or satisfied in accordance with the terms of the Plan




10.                                        Non-Exclusivity.  Nothing in this Subpart A shall prohibit the Administrator from making discretionary Awards to Eligible Directors pursuant to the other provisions of this Plan or outside this Plan, not otherwise inconsistent with these provisions.
