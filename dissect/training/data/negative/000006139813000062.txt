Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Agreement, as of the Grant Date   the Company has granted the Option Award set forth herein to Optionee.  Capitalized terms used   but not defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings given to them in the Plan.   1. Grant of Option.  The Company has granted to Optionee the right and option to purchase   from the Company, at the exercise price set forth in Section 3 below (the "Option Price"),   all or any whole number portion of the aggregate number of shares (the "Shares") of   Common Stock set forth in Section 3 (with such grant sometimes hereinafter referred to   as the "Award").   2. Terms and Conditions.  The Option shall at all times be subject to the provisions of the   Plan (which are incorporated herein by reference) and the following terms and   conditions:   (a) Expiration Date.  The Option shall expire on the expiration date set forth in   Section 3 below; provided, however, that:   (i) Termination of Service for Cause.  In the event of a Termination of   Service of Optionee by the Company for Cause (as defined in the Plan),   the Option, to the extent vested but not previously exercised, shall   terminate and be forfeited (without value) to the Company immediately   upon such Termination of Service for Cause.   (ii) Other Termination of Service.  In the event of a Termination of Service of   Optionee for any reason other than a Termination of Service described in   Section 2(a)(i) above or in Section 2(a)(iii) below, Optionee may exercise   the vested portion of the Option (unless previously terminated or   exercised) at any time until the earlier of: (A) the tenth (10th) anniversary   of the Grant Date; or (B) the expiration of twelve (12) months from the   last business day of the calendar month in which such Termination of   Service of Optionee occurred.   (iii) Termination of Service by Death or Disability.  In the event of a   Termination of Service of Optionee due to death or Disability (as defined   below) of Optionee, the vested portion of the Option (unless previously   terminated or exercised) may be exercised (but only to the extent     

 





 2   exercisable by Optionee as of the date of Optionee’s death or Disability)   within the one (1) year period following Optionee’s death or Disability,   but in no event later than the tenth (10th)  anniversary of the Grant Date,   by the person or persons designated in Optionee’s will for that purpose, or,   in the absence of any such designation, by the legal representative of   Optionee’s estate, or by Optionee or Optionee’s legal representative, as the   case may be.  For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Disability” shall   mean a permanent and total disability as defined in Section 22(e)(3) of the   Code.   (b) Exercise of Option.  To the extent vested, the Option may be exercised in whole   or in part from time to time by providing written notice of such exercise, in a form   of such notice specified by the Company, to the Corporate Secretary of the   Company at the Company’s principal office ten (10) days prior to the date of   exercise.  Any exercise of the Option must be for a whole number of Shares, and   no fractional Shares may be issued or otherwise result from any exercise of the   Option.  No Shares shall be issued or delivered pursuant to any exercise of the   Option until full payment of the Purchase Price for such Shares pursuant to such   exercise, and applicable withholding taxes, if any, has been made.  The Company   has provided that payment of all amounts due upon exercise (the Purchase Price   and any applicable withholding taxes) may be made by any combination of the   following methods:   (i) by cash, check, bank draft, or money order payable to the Company;    (ii) pursuant to a broker-assisted cashless exercise program approved by the   Company that, prior to the issuance of the Common Stock subject to the   Option, results in delivery of a properly executed exercise notice together   with irrevocable instructions to a broker approved by the Company to   promptly deliver to the Company sufficient proceeds from the sale of   Common Stock to pay the aggregate Purchase Price and any applicable   withholding taxes;   (iii) by delivery to the Company (either by actual delivery or attestation   presenting satisfactory proof of beneficial ownership of such Common   Stock) of shares of Common Stock already owned by Optionee, with the   Fair Market Value of such Common Stock as delivered to be determined   as of the day of exercise; or   (iv) by a “net exercise” arrangement pursuant to which the Company will   reduce the number of shares of Common Stock issued upon exercise by   the largest whole number of shares with a Fair Market Value (determined   as of the same day as the exercise of the Option) that does not exceed the   aggregate Purchase Price; provided, however, that the Company shall   accept a cash or other payment from Optionee to the extent of any   remaining balance of the aggregate Purchase Price not satisfied by such   reduction in the number of whole shares of Common Stock to be issued;     

 





 3   provided, further, that shares of Common Stock will no longer be   outstanding under an Option and will not be exercisable thereafter to the   extent that (A) shares are used to pay the Purchase Price pursuant to the   “net exercise,” (B) are delivered to Optionee as a result of such exercise,   and (C) shares are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations.   (c) Tax Withholding.  The Company may make such provisions and take such steps   as it deems necessary or appropriate for the withholding of any taxes that the   Company is required by law or regulation of any governmental authority, whether   federal, state, or local, to withhold in connection with the Option or Shares subject   to this Agreement.  Optionee shall pay to the Company, upon notice of the   amount due, any withholding taxes payable with respect to any exercise of the   Option or any other transaction in connection with the Option or Shares subject to   this Agreement, which payment may be made by any appropriate combination of   the methods set forth in Section 2(b) above.   (d) Vesting.  Provided that a Termination of Service of Optionee has not occurred on   or before the following respective vesting dates, and subject to the other   provisions of this Agreement, the Option shall vest and become exercisable as   follows:   (i) one-third of the Option ([________] Option Shares) shall vest and become   exercisable on [___________];   (ii) an additional one-third of the Option ([________] Option Shares) shall   vest and become exercisable on [___________]; and   (iii) the remaining one-third of the Option ([________] Option Shares) shall   vest and become exercisable on [___________].   (e) Adjustments Upon a Change of Control and Termination Without Cause or for   Good Reason.  In the event that a Change of Control (as defined in the Plan)   occurs with respect to the Company, then any portion of the Option which   remains outstanding and is not then otherwise vested and exercisable shall   become fully vested and exercisable upon the termination of Optionee’s   employment with the Company or a Subsidiary without Cause or for Good   Reason (as defined in the Plan) during the Applicable Period (as defined in the   Plan).   (f) Transferability of Option.  Subject to Section 2(a)(iii) above, the Option shall be   transferable only through a gift or domestic relations order to immediate family   members of Optionee in accordance with Section 7.3(f) of the Plan.   (g) Stockholder Rights.  Optionee shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to   any Shares subject to the Option prior to the date that such Shares are issued to   Optionee upon the exercise of the Option.     

 





 4   (h) Compliance with Laws and Regulations.  The Option and the issuance of Shares   pursuant to any exercise of the Option pursuant to this Agreement shall be subject   to compliance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and to compliance   with all applicable provisions of the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, as   amended, and By-Laws, as amended.   3.

Adjustments Upon a Change in Capitalization.  In the event of a Change in Capitalization   (as defined in the Plan) that is not also a Change of Control, the Plan Administrator shall   make such proportionate adjustments, if any, as it determines are appropriate and   equitable, and to the extent such an action does not conflict with the Delaware General   Corporation Law or other applicable laws or securities exchange rules, to the number and   class of shares of Common Stock which are subject to the Option and the Option Price   therefore.   5.
