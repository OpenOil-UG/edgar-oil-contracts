Attachment A
 
RSU Award Agreement
Terms and Conditions
 
Grant to:  [Full name]
 
Section 1.  Grant of RSU Award.  Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Agreement, the Company hereby grants this Award to the Participant on the Grant Date on the terms set forth on the cover page of this Agreement, as more fully described in this Attachment A.  This Award is granted under the Plan, which is incorporated herein by this reference and made a part of this Agreement.
 
Section 2.  Issuance of RSUs.
 
(a)           Issuance.  Each RSU shall represent the right to receive one Share upon the vesting of such RSU in accordance with this Agreement.
 
(b)           Voting Rights.  The Participant shall have no voting rights with respect to the RSUs unless and until the Participant becomes the record owner of the Shares, including Dividend Shares (as defined below) to the extent applicable, underlying such RSUs.
 
(c)           Dividend Equivalents.  If a dividend is paid on Shares during the period commencing on the Grant Date and ending on the date on which the Shares underlying RSUs are distributed to the Participant, the Participant shall be eligible to receive an amount equal to the amount of the dividend that the Participant would have received had the Shares underlying the RSUs been distributed to the Participant as of the time at which such dividend is paid; it being understood that no such amount shall be payable with respect to any RSUs that are forfeited.  Such amount shall be paid to the Participant on the date on which the Shares underlying the RSUs are distributed to the Participant in the same form (cash, Shares or other property) in which such dividend is paid to holders of Shares generally.  Any Shares that the Participant is eligible to receive pursuant to this Section 2 are referred to herein as Dividend Shares.
 
(d)           Transferability.  The RSUs shall not be assigned, sold, transferred or otherwise be subject to alienation by the Participant.  Any assignment, sale, transfer or other alienation with respect to the Shares issuable upon the vesting of the RSUs shall be in accordance with applicable securities laws.
 
(e)           Withholding Requirements.  The Company may withhold any tax (or other governmental obligation) that becomes due with respect to the RSUs (or any dividend or distribution thereon), and the Participant shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Company to enable the Company to satisfy all such withholding requirements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee, in its

sole discretion, may permit the Participant to satisfy any such withholding requirement by transferring to the Company pursuant to such procedures as the Committee may require, effective as of the date on which such requirement arises, a number of vested Shares owned and designated by the Participant having an aggregate Fair Market Value as of such date that is equal to the minimum amount required to be withheld.  If the Committee permits the Participant to satisfy any such withholding requirement pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Company shall remit to the Internal Revenue Service and appropriate state and local revenue agencies, for the credit of the Participant, an amount of cash withholding equal to the Fair Market Value of the Shares transferred to the Company as provided above.
 
Section 3.  Accelerated Vesting, Forfeiture upon Termination of Service and Distribution.
 
(a)           Death or Disability.  In the event of the Participants Termination of Service at any time due to the Participants death or Disability, the RSUs shall fully vest.
 
(b)           For Cause.  In the event of the Participants Termination of Service at any time for cause (as defined in the Companys Bye-Laws, as may be amended from time to time), any unvested RSUs shall be forfeited in their entirety without any payment to the Participant or, in the Committees sole discretion, if required pursuant to applicable law to effect such forfeiture, the Company may repurchase the RSUs at their par value.
 
(c)           For Any Other Reason.  In the event of the Participants Termination of Service at any time under circumstances not described in Sections 3(a) or 3(b), (i) the portion of the RSUs that is scheduled to vest on the next applicable vesting date shall vest on the date of such Termination of Service and (ii) the portion of the RSUs that is not scheduled to vest in accordance with clause (i) shall be forfeited in its entirety without any payment to the Participant or, in the Committees sole discretion, if required pursuant to applicable law to effect such forfeiture, the Company may repurchase the RSUs at their par value.
 
(d)           Distribution on Vesting.  Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, upon the vesting of any of the RSUs, the Company shall distribute to the Participant, on or within 30 days after the date of such vesting, one Share for each such RSU and the number of Dividend Shares determined in accordance with Section 2(c) of this Attachment A.  Subject to any applicable Lock Up Agreement, on such distribution, such Shares (including Dividend Shares) shall be fully assignable, saleable and transferable by the Participant, and the Company shall deliver such Shares to the Participant by transfer or issuance to the Depository Trust Company for the benefit of the Participant or by delivery of a share certificate registered in the Participants name and such transfer or issuance shall be evidenced in the register of members of the Company.
