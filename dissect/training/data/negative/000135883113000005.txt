The term “Title Defect,” as used in this Agreement, means any encumbrance, encroachment, irregularity, defect in or objection to Seller's ownership of any Asset (excluding Permitted Encumbrances) that causes Seller not to have Defensible Title to that Asset.  Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the following matters shall not constitute, and shall not be asserted as a Title Defect or a breach of Seller's special warranty of title in the Assignment:  (a) defects or irregularities arising out of a lack of evidence of, or other defects with respect to, authorization, execution, delivery or acknowledgment of documents, or a variation in name, unless Buyer provides affirmative evidence that such matter results in another Person's superior claim of title to the relevant Asset; (b) defects or irregularities that have been cured or remedied by the passage of time, including applicable statutes of limitation and statutes for prescription or preemption; (c) defects or irregularities in the chain of title consisting of the failure to recite marital status in documents or omissions of heirship proceedings, unless Buyer provides reasonable evidence that such failure has resulted in another Person's superior claim of title; (d) defects or irregularities in title which for a period of seven (7) years or more have not delayed or prevented Seller (or Seller's predecessor, if owned by Seller less than seven (7) years) from receiving Seller's Net Revenue Interest share of the proceeds of production and have not caused Seller to bear a share of expenses or costs greater than Seller's Working Interest share from any Lease, unit or well; (e) defects or irregularities resulting from or related to probate proceedings or the lack of probate proceedings if the defects or irregularities have been outstanding for seven (7) years or more, unless Buyer provides reasonable evidence that such failure has resulted in another Person's superior claim of title; (f) conventional rights or reassignment normally actuated by an intent to abandon or release a Lease and requiring notice to the holders of such rights; (g) lack of a survey, unless a survey is required by Law; (h) any failure of the records of any Person to reflect sufficient production or operations to maintain a Lease in force and effect prior to 2006 absent reasonable evidence that such failure has caused such Lease to terminate or would result in a termination of such Lease pending only action by the lessor under such Lease; (i) matters based solely on assertions that Seller's (or the applicable operator's) files lack information (including title opinions); (j) failure of the records of any Governmental Authority (including the United States Bureau of Land Management) to reflect Seller as the owner of an interest in a Lease, provided that the instruments evidencing a chain of title of such interest to Seller are recorded in the real property records of the applicable county; (k) failure to record Leases issued by the United States Bureau of Land Management, the State of New Mexico or any other Governmental Authority in the real property records of the county in which such Leases are located; provided that (i) such Leases are recorded with the United States Bureau of Land Management, the State of New Mexico or such other Governmental Authority, as applicable, and (ii) the instruments evidencing the chain of title to Seller with respect to such Leases are recorded in the real property, conveyance, or other records of the applicable county; (l) unreleased instruments executed prior to the year 2002 (including prior oil, gas and/or mineral leases and mortgages) absent reasonable evidence that such instruments continue in force and effect and constitute a -16-superior claim of title to or valid lien on an Asset; (m) calls on oil and/or gas production under existing Contracts, provided that the holder of such right must pay an indexed-based price for any production purchased by virtue of such call on production; or (n) any defect or irregularity as would normally be waived by Persons engaged in the oil and gas business when purchasing producing properties.Section 4.04Notice of Title Defects.(a) If Buyer discovers any alleged Title Defect affecting any Asset, Buyer shall notify Seller of the alleged Title Defect as promptly as possible, but no later than the expiration of the Examination Period.  To be effective, this notice (a “Title Defect Notice”) must (i) be in writing; (ii) be received by Seller prior to the expiration of the Examination Period; (iii) describe the Title Defect in sufficient, specific detail (including any alleged variance in the Net Revenue Interest or Working Interest); (iv) include copies of documents necessary for Seller to verify the existence of the alleged Title Defect, (v) identify the specific Asset or Assets affected by the Title Defect; and (vi) include the  Title Defect Value as determined by Buyer.  Any matters that otherwise may have constituted Title Defects, but that are not so described in a timely Title Defect Notice complying and delivered in accordance with this Section 4.04(a), shall be deemed to have been waived by Buyer for all purposes and shall constitute Permitted Encumbrances.(b)After receipt of an effective Title Defect Notice, Seller shall have the option, but not the obligation, to attempt to cure the Title Defect at any time prior to the Closing and to postpone the Closing Date up to thirty (30) days beyond the date set forth in Section 12.01 to facilitate the cure.(c)The value attributable to each Title Defect (the “Title Defect Value”) that is asserted by Buyer in a Title Defect Notice shall be determined in good faith based upon the criteria set forth below:(i)If the Title Defect is a lien on any Asset, the Title Defect Value is the amount necessary to be paid to remove the lien from the affected Asset.(ii)If the Title Defect asserted is that the Net Revenue Interest attributable to any well, unit, well location or Lease is less than that stated in Exhibit B or the Working Interest attributable to any well, unit or well location is greater than that stated in Exhibit B, then the Title Defect Value shall take into account the relative change in the interest from Exhibit B and the appropriate Allocated Value of such Asset.  For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Allocated Value” means, with respect to any Asset, the amount allocated to that Asset under Section 11.01.(iii)If the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden or charge on the affected Asset (including any increase in Working Interest for which there is not a proportionate increase in Net Revenue Interest) for which the economic detriment to Buyer is unliquidated, the amount of the Title Defect Value shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the affected Asset, the portion of the Asset affected by the Title Defect, the legal -17-effect of the Title Defect, the potential discounted economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of the affected Asset and the Title Defect Value placed upon the Title Defect by Buyer and Seller.(iv)If a Title Defect is not in effect or does not adversely affect an Asset throughout the entire productive life of such Asset, the consequences of that fact shall be taken into account in determining the Title Defect Value.(v)The Title Defect Value of a Title Defect shall be determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another Title Defect Value. For example, if a lien which constitutes a Title Defect affects more than one Asset or the curative work with respect to one Title Defect results (or is reasonably expected to result) in the curing of any other Title Defect affecting the same or another Asset, the amount necessary to discharge such lien or the cost and expense of such curative work shall be allocated among the Assets so affected (in the ratios of the respective portions of the Allocated Values of such Assets) and the amount so allocated to a Title Defect Property shall be included only once in the Title Defect Value.(vi)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall a Title Defect Value exceed the Allocated Value of the wells, units, well locations or other Assets affected by it.(vii)To give Seller an opportunity to commence reviewing possible Title Defects, Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to give Seller, on or before 5:00 p.m. Central Time each Friday prior to the expiration of the Examination Period, notice of all Title Defects discovered by Buyer during the preceding week, which notice may be preliminary in nature and supplemented prior to the expiration of the Examination Period.Section 4.05Remedies for Title Defects.(a)Subject to the continuing right of Seller to dispute the existence of an asserted Title Defect and/or the asserted Title Defect Value and subject to the rights of the Parties under Section 13.01(f), if any Title Defect timely asserted by Buyer in accordance with Section 4.04(a) is not waived in writing by Buyer or cured on or before Closing, Seller shall, at Seller's sole option, elect to:(i)subject to Section 4.05(d), reduce the Purchase Price by the Title Defect Value for the Title Defect as determined in accordance with Section 4.04(c) or Article XVIII (which shall cause such asserted Title Defect to become an Assumed Obligation under Section 16.02);(ii)indemnify Buyer against all claims resulting from the Title Defect (an “Indemnified Title Defect”) pursuant to an indemnity agreement (the “Title Indemnity Agreement”) in the form attached to this Agreement as Exhibit D; provided, however, that without Buyer's consent, Seller shall not be entitled to elect to indemnify Buyer under this Section 4.05(a)(ii) for any Title Defect that is -18-a discrepancy in the Net Revenue Interest and/or Working Interest of a well, unit, well location or Lease (as compared to the Net Revenue Interest and/or Working Interest set forth in Exhibit B with respect to such Asset); or(iii)retain the entirety of the Asset that is subject to the Title Defect, together with all associated Assets, in which event the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of the Asset and the associated Assets.(b)If any Title Defect is in the nature of an unobtained consent to assignment or other restriction on assignability, the provisions of Section 4.08 shall apply.(c)If at or before the Closing Buyer and Seller have not agreed on the validity of any asserted Title Defect or the Title Defect Value attributable to the Title Defect and Seller has not elected to indemnify Buyer with respect to the Title Defect under Section 4.05(a)(ii) or to retain the Assets associated with the Title Defect under Section 4.05(a)(iii), Buyer or Seller shall have the right to elect to have the Dispute regarding the validity of the Title Defect or the Title Defect Value determined by an Independent Expert in accordance with Article XVIII.  In that event, the Purchase Price paid at Closing shall not be reduced by virtue of the disputed Title Defect or Title Defect Value, but upon the final resolution of the Dispute, the Title Defect Value, if any, found to be attributable to the Title Defect shall, subject to Section 4.05(d), be refunded by Seller to Buyer within three (3) Business Days of such resolution.(d)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to Section 4.05(e), (i) if the value of a particular individual Title Defect (or individual Title Benefit, except for an Asset on which there is a Title Defect exceeding $40,000) does not exceed $40,000, then it shall be deemed to be a Permitted Encumbrance and no adjustment to the Purchase Price shall be made or other remedies provided by Seller for the Title Defect (or Title Benefit), (ii) if the aggregate adjustment to the Purchase Price determined in accordance with this Agreement for Title Defects (after taking into account clause (i)) does not exceed two percent (2%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price prior to any other adjustments, then they shall be deemed to be Permitted Encumbrances and no adjustment of the Purchase Price shall be made or other remedies provided by Seller on account of Title Defects, and (iii) if the aggregate adjustment to the Purchase Price determined in accordance with this Agreement for Title Defects (after taking into account clause (i)) does exceed two percent (2%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price prior to any other adjustments, then the Purchase Price shall be adjusted only by the amount of the excess and no other adjustment of the Purchase Price shall be made or other remedies provided by Seller on account of Title Defects. (e)Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4.05(d) and the other provisions of this Agreement, in the event Buyer asserts a Title Defect as a result of Seller's Net Revenue Interest in any well, unit, well location or Lease being less than that stated in Exhibit B and Seller owns a fee mineral, royalty or other similar non-leasehold oil, gas or other mineral interest in such well, unit, well location or Lease, then (i) the Assets shall be deemed to include such fee mineral, royalty or other similar non-leasehold oil, -19-gas or other mineral interest; (ii) such fee mineral, royalty or other similar non-leasehold oil, gas or other mineral interest shall be conveyed by Seller to Buyer at the Closing; (iii) to the extent the inclusion of such fee mineral, royalty or other similar non-leasehold oil, gas or other mineral interest eliminates such Net Revenue Interest deficiency, the deficiency shall not constitute a Title Defect; and (iv) to the extent the inclusion of such fee mineral, royalty or other similar non-leasehold oil, gas or other mineral interest in the Assets results in Seller's Net Revenue Interest being greater than that stated in Exhibit B, the excess shall constitute a Title Benefit.Section 4.06Special Warranty of Title.  The documents to be executed and delivered by Seller to Buyer transferring title to the Assets as required hereby, including the Assignment and Bill of Sale attached hereto as Exhibit C (the “Assignment”), shall provide for a special warranty of title warranting title by, through and under Seller, but not otherwise, subject to the Permitted Encumbrances and the terms of this Agreement.  Buyer's remedy for breach of Seller's special warranty of title in the Assignment shall be limited to an amount not exceeding the Allocated Value of the affected Asset, and any claims for such breach must be asserted within eighteen (18) months from the Closing Date.  Any such claims not asserted within such eighteen (18) month period shall be deemed to be Assumed Obligations.Section 4.07Preferential Rights To Purchase.(a)Seller shall use reasonable efforts, but without any obligation to incur any additional cost or expense, to comply with all preferential right to purchase provisions relative to any Asset (“PPRs”) prior to the Closing.  Prior to the Closing, Seller shall notify Buyer of the existence of any known PPRs and if any PPRs are exercised or if the requisite period has elapsed without said rights having been exercised.  (b)If, as of the Closing Date, a Third Party holder of a PPR has timely and properly notified Seller that it elects to exercise its PPR with respect to the Assets to which its PPR applies (determined by and in accordance with the agreement in which the PPR arises), then the Assets covered by that PPR will be sold to such holder of the PPR subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and will not be sold to the Party originally executing this Agreement as “Buyer” (subject to the remaining provisions in this Article), and the Unadjusted Purchase Price will be reduced by the Allocated Value of such Assets.  Buyer shall remain obligated to purchase the remainder of the Assets not affected by an exercised PPR.  Upon the consummation of the sale of any Assets to the holder of such PPR, any such Assets shall be deemed for all purposes to constitute “Excluded Assets”.(c)After the Closing, if for any reason the purchase and sale of the Assets covered by a PPR exercised prior to Closing under (b) above is not or cannot be consummated with the holder of the PPR that exercised its PPR, Seller may so notify Buyer and within ten (10) Business Days after Buyer's receipt of such notice, Seller shall sell, assign and convey to Buyer and Buyer shall purchase and accept from Seller such Assets pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and for the Allocated Value of such Assets (except the Closing Date with respect to such Assets will be the date of assignment of such Assets from Seller to Buyer).-20-(d)Any interest in the Assets covered by any unexercised PPRs (whether due to the PPR notice period or otherwise) shall be conveyed to Buyer at the Closing subject to any PPRs, and Buyer shall assume all duties, obligations and liabilities arising from the PPR.  Without limiting the foregoing, if any Third Party elects to purchase all or a part of an interest in any Asset subject to a PPR after the Closing Date, Buyer shall be obligated to convey that interest to that Third Party and shall be entitled to the consideration for the sale of that interest.Section 4.08Consents to Assignment.  Seller shall use reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary consents from Third Parties to assign the Assets prior to the Closing (other than approvals of any relevant Governmental Authority that are customarily obtained after the Closing), and Buyer shall assist Seller with those efforts; provided, however, Seller shall not be obligated to pay any consideration to (or incur any cost or expense for the benefit of) the holder of the consent in order to obtain a waiver or consent. To the extent any such consents are not obtained prior to Closing and an express provision of the document providing for the consent would render the assignment of some or all of the Assets void or voidable, give rise to a claim for specified liquidated damages or cause the termination of the Lease or other Asset to be assigned as a result of the failure to obtain that consent, then that failure shall constitute a Title Defect as to the portion of the Assets affected thereby, and the provisions of Section 4.05(a) shall apply thereto.  In all other cases, such unobtained consents shall not constitute Title Defects.Section 4.09Title Benefits; Remedies.  (a)If any Party discovers any Title Benefit during the Examination Period affecting the Assets, it shall promptly notify the other Parties at or before the expiration of the Examination Period.  Subject to Section 4.05(d), Seller shall be entitled to an upward adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 12.02(a)(iii) with respect to the Title Benefit, in an amount mutually agreed upon by the Parties.  For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Title Benefit” means the Seller's interest in any Asset that is greater than or in addition to that set forth in Exhibit B, including a Net Revenue Interest that is greater than that set forth in Exhibit B or Seller's Working Interest in any Asset that is less than the Working Interest set forth in Exhibit B (without a corresponding decrease in the Net Revenue Interest).(b)If, with respect to a Title Benefit, Buyer and Seller have not agreed on the amount of the upward Purchase Price Adjustment or have not otherwise agreed on such amount at or prior to the Closing, Seller or Buyer shall have the right to elect to have the Dispute regarding the Purchase Price Adjustment determined by an Independent Expert in accordance with Article XVIII.  In that event, Buyer shall pay the undisputed portion of the Purchase Price with respect to the Asset affected by the Title Benefit at the Closing and, subject to Section 4.05(d), upon determination of the amount of the adjustment, shall pay to Seller any unpaid portion within three (3) Business Days of such determination.-21-Article VEnvironmental MattersSection 5.04Environmental Review.(a)Buyer shall have the right to conduct or cause a consultant reasonably acceptable to Seller (“Buyer's Environmental Consultant”) to conduct an environmental review of the Assets prior to the expiration of the Examination Period (“Buyer's Environmental Review”).  The cost and expense of Buyer's Environmental Review, if any, shall be borne solely by Buyer. The scope of work comprising Buyer's Environmental Review shall be limited to a Phase I review and otherwise as may be agreed by Buyer and Seller prior to commencement.  The Environmental Review shall not include any intrusive test or procedure without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld.  Buyer shall, and shall cause Buyer's Environmental Consultant to, (i) consult with Seller before conducting any work comprising Buyer's Environmental Review, (ii) perform all such work in a safe and workmanlike manner and so as to not unreasonably interfere with the operation of the Assets and (iii) comply with all applicable Law.  Buyer shall be solely responsible for obtaining any consents from a Third Party that are required to perform any work comprising Buyer's Environmental Review, and Buyer shall consult with Seller prior to requesting each such consent.  Seller shall have the right to have a representative or representatives accompany Buyer and Buyer's Environmental Consultant at all times during Buyer's Environmental Review.  With respect to any samples taken in connection with Buyer's Environmental Review, Buyer shall take split samples, providing one of each such sample, properly labeled and identified, to Seller without charge.  Buyer releases, and shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless, Seller Indemnitees from and against all claims, losses, damages, costs, expenses, causes of action and judgments of any kind or character (INCLUDING THOSE RESULTING FROM SELLER'S SOLE, JOINT, COMPARATIVE OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY, BUT SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDING THOSE RESULTING FROM SELLER'S GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT) arising out of or relating to Buyer's Environmental Review. The indemnity and other obligations set forth in the immediately preceding sentence shall survive the Closing or termination of this Agreement.(b)Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, Buyer shall, and shall cause Buyer's Environmental Consultant to, treat confidentially any matters revealed by Buyer's Environmental Review and any reports or data generated from such review (the “Environmental Information”), and Buyer shall not, and shall cause Buyer's Environmental Consultant to not, disclose any Environmental Information to any Governmental Authority or other Third Party without the prior written consent of Seller.  Buyer may use the Environmental Information only in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  If Buyer, Buyer's Environmental Consultant or any Third Party to which Buyer has provided any Environmental Information become legally compelled to disclose any of the Environmental Information, Buyer shall provide Seller with prompt notice sufficiently prior to any such disclosure so as to allow Seller to file any protective order or seek any other remedy, as Seller deems appropriate under the -22-circumstances.  Buyer shall provide to Seller copies of any Environmental Information generated by Buyer or Buyer's Environmental Consultant promptly after Buyer's receipt thereof.  If this Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing, Buyer shall promptly deliver the Environmental Information to Seller, which Environmental Information shall become the sole property of Seller without charge. The confidentiality and other obligations set forth in this paragraph shall survive the termination of this Agreement.Section 5.02Environmental Definitions.(a)Assumed Environmental Obligations.  For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Assumed Environmental Obligations” means, with respect to Seller's ownership of the Assets, the operation of the Assets or the condition of the Assets and any surface or subsurface depths used in connection with the Assets, including any pooled, communitized or unitized acreage by virtue of the Assets being a part of the pooled, communitized or unitized area (collectively, the “Subject Property”), all liabilities, losses, claims, obligations, costs or expenses arising from or relating to the following: (i) any violation or alleged violation of, or non-compliance with applicable Environmental Law prior to, on, or after the Effective Time, including the cost of correcting such violations or noncompliance and any fines or penalties arising out of such violations or noncompliance; (ii) the release, discharge or disposal of Hazardous Substances prior to, on, or after the Effective Time, at, on, in, under, from or migrating to or from the Subject Property, including claims for property damage, loss, injury, damage to natural resources, bodily injury or wrongful death, and any investigation, remediation or monitoring with respect to said Hazardous Substances; (iii) any Environmental Defects that are not Indemnified Environmental Defects; or (iv) those matters that would otherwise be Environmental Defects but for the provisions of Section 5.04(c).(b)Environmental Defects.  For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Environmental Defect” means, with respect to any given Asset, an individual environmental condition identified with specificity in Buyer's Environmental Review that constitutes a material violation of Environmental Laws in effect as of the date of this Agreement in the jurisdiction in which the affected Asset is located, excluding, however any environmental conditions (i) deemed not to be Environmental Defects by application of Section 5.04(c), or (ii) relating to asbestos or NORM as described in Section 5.07.(c)Environmental Defect Value.  For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Environmental Defect Value” means, with respect to any Environmental Defect, the value, as of the Closing Date, of the estimated costs and expenses to correct the Environmental Defect in the most cost-effective manner reasonably available, consistent with Environmental Laws, taking into account that non-permanent remedies (such as mechanisms to contain or stabilize hazardous materials, including monitoring site conditions, natural attenuation, risk-based corrective action, institutional controls or other appropriate restrictions on the use of property, caps, dikes, encapsulation, leachate collection systems, etc.) may be the most cost-effective manner reasonably available. The Environmental Defect Value of an Environmental Defect shall be determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another Environmental Defect Value. For example, if a matter which constitutes an Environmental Defect affects more than one -23-Asset or the curative work with respect to one Environmental Defect results (or is reasonably expected to result) in the curing of any other Environmental Defect affecting the same or another Asset, the amount of such curative work shall be allocated among the Assets so affected (in the ratios of the respective portions of the Allocated Values of such Assets) and the amount so allocated shall be included only once in the Environmental Defect Value.(d)Environmental Laws.  For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Environmental Laws” means all Laws pertaining to health (as relates to exposure to Hazardous Substances) or the environment, including the Clean Air Act, as amended, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, the Resources Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, the Safe Drinking Water Act, as amended, the Toxic Substances Control Act, as amended, the Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act of 1986, as amended, the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act, as amended, and comparable state and local laws.(e)Hazardous Substances.

To the extent that Seller or an Affiliate of Seller is not the operator of an Asset, the obligations of Seller in this Article XV shall be construed to require that Seller use reasonable efforts (without being obligated to incur any material expense or institute any cause of action) to cause the operator of that Asset to take such actions or render such performance within the constraints of the applicable operating agreements and other applicable agreements.(b)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article XV, Seller shall have no liability to Buyer for, and Buyer agrees to release, defend, indemnify and hold harmless Seller, Seller's members, managers, Affiliates, co-lessees, co-venturers and their respective officers, directors, managers, employees, agents, partners, representatives, members, shareholders, Affiliates, subsidiaries, successors and assigns (collectively, “Seller Indemnitees”) from, the incorrect payment of delay rentals, royalties, shut-in royalties or similar payments or for any failure to pay any such payments through mistake or oversight (INCLUDING THOSE RESULTING FROM SELLER INDEMNITEES' SOLE, JOINT, COMPARATIVE OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY) to the extent that such payments relate to periods after the Effective Time.

It is expressly understood and agreed that Seller shall not be obligated to continue operating any of the operated Assets following the Closing and Buyer assumes full responsibility for operating (or causing the operation of) all such Assets following the Closing.  Seller does not warrant or guarantee that Buyer will become the operator of the operated Assets or any portion of the Assets, as such matter will be controlled by the applicable joint operating agreement(s).  Without implying any obligation on Seller's part to continue operating any operated Assets after the Closing, if Seller elects to continue to operate any such Assets following the Closing at the request of Buyer or any Third Party working interest owner, due to constraints of applicable joint operating agreement(s), failure of a successor operator to take over operations or other reasonable cause, the continued operation by Seller shall be for the account of Buyer, at the sole risk, cost and expense of Buyer.  Buyer releases and agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller Indemnitees, as a part of the Assumed Obligations, from and against all claims, losses, damages, costs, expenses, causes of action and judgments of any kind or character (INCLUDING THOSE RESULTING FROM SELLER INDEMNITEES' SOLE, JOINT, COMPARATIVE OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY) with respect to (a) continued operations by Seller, (b) Buyer's assumption of operations from Seller, and (c) compliance with the terms of any applicable joint operating agreement related to the election of a successor operator.  -43-Section 15.04Change in Circumstances; Casualty Loss.(a)Buyer shall assume all risk of loss with respect to, and any change in the condition of, the Assets from the Effective Time until the Closing, including with respect to the depletion of Hydrocarbons, the watering-out of any well, the collapse of casing, sand infiltration of wells and damage to and depreciation of property, including normal wear and tear.(b)If after the Effective Time and prior to the Closing any part of the Assets shall be damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty or if any part of the Assets shall be taken in condemnation or under the right of eminent domain or if proceedings for such purposes shall be pending or threatened, this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any such destruction, taking or proceeding, or the threat of any such destruction, taking or proceeding, and the Parties shall proceed with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement notwithstanding such destruction or taking without reduction of the Purchase Price, but subject to Section 15.04(c).
