 Exhibit B  Dedication, Receipt Points and Delivery Point  Approach dedicates and commits the Dedicated
Interest to this Agreement for the Term. Any transfer by Approach of any interest in the Dedicated Interest shall be subject to Wildcats rights under this Agreement. After the Operations Commencement Date, and so long as Wildcat is not in
material breach of this Agreement, Approach shall not deliver Dedicated Oil to any person other than Wildcat. The covenants of Approach in this Agreement shall be covenants attaching to and running with the Dedicated Interest and shall be binding on
the successors and assigns of Approach as to the Dedicated Interest, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement.  Well Connections
 In addition to the initial Receipt Points illustrated on the map below, Approach shall give Wildcat written notice (Completion
Notice) of the date (Completion Date) on which Approach reasonably believes that each well, in which Approach has a Dedicated Interest, will be completed and capable of producing and delivering crude oil. In the event
that Approach and Wildcat agree on mutually acceptable incremental economic terms, Wildcat shall construct all gathering lines, pipelines, pumps, terminals and related facilities (Wellhead Receipt Facilities) that are necessary to
receive crude oil from each such well on or before the date (Connection Date) which is later of (i) the Completion Date set forth in the Completion Notice for such well or (ii) [REDACTED]* days after the
Completion Notice is given by Approach to Wildcat for such well. Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, Wildcat shall not be obligated to receive crude oil from any such well until it has constructed the Wellhead Receipt Facilities for
such well or such well is otherwise connected to Wildcats gathering system at the initial Receipt Points or as provided below. In the event that Wildcat agrees to construct a new Wellhead Receipt Facility in exchange for an additional fee,
then that Wellhead Receipt Facility shall be included as a future Receipt Point for purposes of this Agreement. If Wildcat has not constructed the Wellhead Receipt Facilities by the Connection Date, then, upon written notice to Wildcat at any time
thereafter until such facilities are constructed, Approach may construct, own and operate the facilities necessary to connect such well to any existing Receipt Point, and deliver the crude oil produced from such well to such Receipt Point. However,
as to any well that, as of the Operations Commencement Date, is already completed and capable of producing crude oil, Approach may construct, own and operate the facilities necessary to connect such well to any existing Receipt Point, and deliver
the crude oil produced from such well to such Receipt Point if Wildcat has not constructed the Wellhead Receipt Facilities within [REDACTED]*days of the Operations Commencement Date.  [REDACTED]*  [REDACTED]*.  
[REDACTED]*  [REDACTED]*.
 Lockbox Account  The Lockbox
Account will be established and maintained with signatory to [REDACTED]* designated personnel.  Assignment of Claims 
If (i) a party (or parties) that is a buyer under a TP CPA, breaches its obligation to purchase and/or pay for crude oil under such TP CPA, and
(ii) Approach gives Wildcat written notice that it desires to initiate legal proceedings against such buyer with respect to the quantities of crude oil that Wildcat is obligated to purchase from Approach and resell to such buyer under such TP
CPA, then Wildcat shall promptly assign Approach any and all claims and causes of action that Wildcat may have with respect to such quantities.

 Exhibit C  GENERAL PROVISIONS  1. SET-OFFS: In the event either party shall
fail to make timely delivery of any crude oil and/or condensate or other applicable products due and owing to the other party, or in the event that either party shall fail to make timely payment of any monies due and owing to the party, the other
party may set off any deliveries or payments due under this or any other agreement between the parties. Party for the purposes of this paragraph shall include for each party its affiliates (including, but not limited to, both parent and
subsidiary companies). It is the intent of the parties to this Agreement to treat each party hereto and its respective affiliates (including, but not limited to, both parent and subsidiary corporate entities) as a single legal entity for the
purposes of set-off regarding debts and claims.  2. RIGHT TO AUDIT: In the event the price of the crude oil or
condensate sold hereunder is based on an average acquisition cost, Approach agrees to maintain and retain all pertinent books, records and documents relating to the transactions hereunder for a period of not less than two (2) years following
termination of this Agreement, and Wildcat or its duly authorized representatives shall have access to such records, and the right to audit the same, at all reasonable times during the existence of this Agreement, and for such two (2) year
period following its termination. In the event the price of the crude oil or condensate sold hereunder is based on an weighted average resale price received by Wildcat upon the resale of the crude oil purchased hereunder, Wildcat agrees to maintain
and retain all pertinent books, records and documents relating to such resale transactions and transactions hereunder for a period of not less than two (2) years following termination of this Agreement, and Wildcat or its duly authorized
representatives shall have access to such records, and the right to audit the same, at all reasonable times during the existence of this Agreement, and for such two (2) year period following its termination. 
3. MEASUREMENTS AND TEST: Quantities of oil delivered hereunder shall be determined from tank gauges on 100% tank table basis or
by the use of mutually acceptable automatic measuring equipment. Volume and gravity of said quantities shall be corrected for temperature to 60 degrees Fahrenheit in accordance with the latest A.S.T.M.-I.P. Petroleum Measurement Tables. The oil
delivered hereunder shall be merchantable and acceptable to the carriers involved but not to exceed one percent (1%) S&W. Full deduction shall be made for all S&W content as determined by tests conducted according to the latest A.S.T.M.
standard method in effect. Tests for quality shall be made at regular intervals by Approach in accordance with generally accepted industry procedures. Each party shall have the right to have a representative or independent inspector (which cost
shall be shared equally between the parties hereto) present to witness all gauges, tests and measurements.  4.
WARRANTY: Approach warrants title, free and clear of all taxes, liens and encumbrances which are customarily paid by Approach prior to delivery, to the crude oil sold and delivered hereunder and warrants that said oil has been produced,
handled and transported to the Receipt Points in material compliance with the laws, rules and regulations of all local, state or federal authorities having jurisdiction thereof. In this regard, Approach agrees to provide Wildcat with any relevant
transaction documentation reasonably requested.  5. FORCE MAJEURE: Continued performance by either party of any
obligation except as to payment due hereunder, may be suspended immediately to the extent caused or contributed to by acts of God, fire, labor or trade disturbance, war, civil commotion or act of the public enemy, unavailability of transportation,
storage, manufacturing, refining or distributing facilities, compliance in good faith with any applicable foreign or domestic regulation or order, whether or not it later proves to be invalid, or any cause beyond the reasonable control of either
Wildcat or Approach whether similar or dissimilar to the enumeration contained herein, except inability to discharge financial obligations when due (a Force Majeure) (for clarity, if any TP Purchaser invokes a force majeure
event excusing performance under any TP CPA, such shall also constitute a Force Majeure for purposes of this Agreement to the extent crude oil purchased hereunder is to be sold under such TP CPA. The party suspending performance under this clause
shall give prompt notice and shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cure promptly the cause for such suspension. Upon cessation of the cause for suspension, performance shall resume (or commence) immediately. [REDACTED]*. In the
event a Force Majeure condition interferes with Wildcats ability to provide an outlet to receive crude oil and/or condensate, Wildcat shall have the option to cure (a Cure) such Force Majeure condition by providing an
alternative commercial outlet for delivery of crude oil and/or condensate on economic terms no less favorable than current market terms (giving due consideration to applicable market 
   C-1






 
considerations). [REDACTED]*. If at any time Wildcat is the party suspending performance (in whole or in part) under this clause, then all Dedicated Oil that Wildcat does not purchase
in reliance on this clause shall not be deemed Dedicated Oil (and shall not be subject to this Agreement) for so long as such Dedicated Oil is not being purchased by Wildcat in reliance on this clause, but upon a Cure or cessation of reliance on
this clause such Dedicated Oil shall once again be deemed Dedicated Oil and subject to this Agreement.  6. TITLE AND
RISK OF LOSS: Title and risk of loss to crude oil delivered shall pass to Wildcat as the crude oil enters the Receipt Points, as defined in Section 4 of this Agreement or a point of interconnection established pursuant to Exhibit
B.  7. MODIFICATION, WAIVER, AND ASSIGNMENT: There shall be no modification or amendment of this Agreement
except by writing, signed by both parties hereto. Waiver of performance of any obligations by either party of default by the other hereunder shall not operate as a waiver of performance of any other obligation or a future waiver of the same
obligation or a waiver of any future default. Neither party shall assign this Agreement to a person or firm except upon written consent of the other party, such consent, however, shall not be unreasonably withheld. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the parties hereto.  8. EQUAL DAILY DELIVERIES: Except
for delivery by truck tanker, for the purpose of invoicing, any crude oil delivered hereunder shall be deemed to have been delivered in equal daily quantities during the calendar month in which deliveries occur. 
9. CHOICE OF LAW: This Agreement shall be constructed in accordance with, and governed by, the law of, and Wildcat and Approach
consent to the jurisdiction of the courts of, the State of Texas.  10. DEFAULT: In the event either party to this
Agreement shall materially breach or default in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, the other party may, upon written notice to the breaching or defaulting party, suspend the performance of its obligation hereunder until such
breach or default is cured. If such material breach or default is not cured within thirty (30) days after written notice of such material breach or default is given, or ten (10) days in the event of payment default (such period, as
applicable, the Cure Period), the party not in material breach or default may terminate this Agreement at any time thereafter until such breach or default is cured upon written notice to the breaching or defaulting party; provided
the other party may not terminate this Agreement if the party alleged to be in breach or default (i) has cured such event giving rise to such alleged breach or default within such Cure Period or (ii) in the event the breach or default is
not capable of being cured within such Cure Period, commences to cure such alleged breach or default within such Cure Period and continues in good faith with such efforts and such alleged breach or default is cured within sixty (60) days after
expiration of such Cure Period. A party will not be considered to be in breach or default of its obligations under this Agreement to the extent that performance of such obligations or its efforts to cure are delayed or prevented, directly or
indirectly, due to Force Majeure as more particularly described in Section 5 of Exhibit C of this Agreement. As a result, the time periods set forth in this section in which a party may cure an alleged breach or default shall
be extended by any period of Force Majeure that occurs during any such period and affects the ability of a party to cure such breach or default.  11. NOTICE: Any notice required or permitted hereunder shall be deemed given when deposited in the U.S. Mail as registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, and
addressed to the party to whom the notice is being given at the address set forth on the first page hereof (or such other address as is provided by written notice in accordance with this provision). Any notice given by fax or email shall be deemed
given when received at address set forth on the first page hereof (or such other address as is provided by written notice in accordance with this provision). During the term of this Agreement each party herein agrees to notify the other party
immediately in writing upon the notifying partys corporate reorganization, merger, or acquisition by another, or any other similar corporate structural change.
