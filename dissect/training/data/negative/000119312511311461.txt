and quality of Gas delivered to the Delivery Point shall be determined from measurements made at the relevant Meter Station in accordance with the metering requirements specified in the Access Arrangement, which shall also determine the standards,
methods and procedures for metering and designing, installing, operating, maintaining and testing the Meter Station unless otherwise agreed by the Parties and the Parties shall be bound by such determination. 
   28 









14.2
Calibration  If a Buyer
proposes, or becomes aware that the Pipeline Operator proposes, to conduct a test of the accuracy of the measuring equipment at the Meter Station the Buyer will provide reasonable notice of the time and nature of such a test and use its reasonable
endeavours to obtain the Pipeline Operators permission for a representative of the Seller to observe the test and an adjustment resulting from such test. If, after notice, the Seller fails to have a representative present, the result of the
test will nevertheless be considered accurate.   


14.3
Correction  If, at any
time, any of the measuring equipment at the Meter Station is found to be out of service or registering inaccurately, the readings of that equipment must be corrected in accordance with the correction procedures specified in the Access Arrangement.
  


14.4
Metering Information 
Each Buyer must send to the Seller copies of all measuring and testing charts, measuring data and measuring information relating to the
Meter Station promptly after receiving them from the Pipeline Operator and the Seller will cause to be sent to each Buyer upon request, copies of such information kept or obtained by the Seller. 
 


14.5
Sellers Proration   


 
(a)
If, on a Day, the Seller does not have a quantity of Gas available for delivery at the Delivery Point equal to the total quantity of Gas properly nominated by all
Customers for that Day, then the Seller will, with respect to a Gas Field being used to supply the Buyer and one or more other Customers, allocate the available quantity of Gas from that Gas Field as between the Buyers and the other Customers such
that it first meets each Buyers DCQ ahead of any allocations to the other relevant Customers provided that, to the extent that the Gas Field is constituted by any gas field other than the Palm Valley Gas Field: 
 


 
(i)
the Seller shall allocate the available quantity of Gas from the Palm Valley Gas Field such that it first meets each Buyers DCQ; and 
 


 
(ii)
in relation to that other gas field, the Seller shall only be required to allocate the available quantity of Gas from that other gas field such that it first meets each
Buyers Percentage Interest of the Nominated Alternate Field Daily Quantity with respect to that other gas field on that Day.  To avoid doubt, nothing in this clause 14.5(a) requires the Seller to allocate to a Buyer on a Day a quantity of Gas greater than that Buyers DCQ on that Day. 
 


 
(b)
For the avoidance of doubt nothing in this clause 14.5 relieves the Seller from its Supply Obligation under clause 8.5 of this Agreement.

within twenty (20) Business Days after the Invoice receipt date, notify the Seller as to the sum in dispute and provide particulars as to the reason for the Invoice dispute, and the following provisions will apply. 
 


 
(b)
Upon receipt of the notice of the Invoice dispute, the Seller shall, within five (5) Business Days, provide such reasonable information as the Buyer shall require to

bona fide attempt to resolve the Invoice dispute prior to the due date for the payment or as soon as possible if the due date for payment has passed.   


 
(d)
If the Invoice dispute is resolved, whether by agreement or pursuant to a decision by a court of competent jurisdiction, in a manner that results in either Party being
required to pay or refund an amount to the other Party, then the

from the original due date of the affected Invoice shall be made.   


 
(e)
The accuracy of any statement, allocation, charge, payment calculation or determination made pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement shall be conclusively presumed
to be correct after two (2) years from the end of the Contract Year in which the statement, allocation, charge, payment calculation or determination was generated or prepared, if not challenged (claimed) in writing under this clause 15.3 prior
thereto. For the avoidance of doubt, all claims shall be deemed waived unless they are made in writing within two (2) years from the end of the Contract Year in which the statement, allocation, charge, payment calculation or determination was

(e)
If any Party disagrees with the auditors opinion, the disagreement will be dealt with as a Dispute capable of reference to an Expert for determination in

16.5
Notification and Mitigation of Force Majeure   


 
(a)

reasonably full particulars of the event or occurrence and an estimate of the time period for which the Force Majeure event is likely to last is required as soon as reasonably possible, provided that a Party shall not lose its right to be relieved
from liability by reason of Force Majeure if it fails to perform the obligations in this clause 16.5 in a timely manner.

16.6
Termination by Reason of Force Majeure   


 
(a)
Should a Force Majeure event occur which causes or results in the complete or substantial inability of the Affected Party to perform obligations under this Agreement
for an aggregate period of 180 days or more in any eighteen (18) month period, the Party not claiming the benefit of the Force Majeure may give notice of termination to the Affected Party and this Agreement shall (unless the Parties
subsequently agree otherwise) terminate ten (10) days after receipt by the Affected Party of such notice regardless of whether the Force Majeure terminates in the meantime. The Parties agree that if: 
 


 
(i)
the Seller does not Make Available for delivery at least an average of 75% of the DCQ prevailing at the time for a period of 180 days or more in any eighteen
(18) month period, this would constitute a substantial inability of the Seller to perform its obligations; and   


 
(ii)
a Buyer does not take delivery of at least an average of 75% of that Buyers DCQ prevailing at the time for a period of 180 days or more in any eighteen
(18) month period, this would constitute a substantial inability of that Buyer to perform its obligations.   


 
(b)
If any Party has a bona fide belief that an event of Force Majeure cannot be, or is unlikely to be, cured within a period of 180 days from the date of the notice of the
Force Majeure, then the Parties shall meet as soon as possible (on a date set by notice from any Party to the other Parties setting a reasonable date for a meeting which shall not be less than ten (10) days nor more than thirty (30) days
after receipt of such notice) to discuss the Force Majeure event and the Affected Party must advise the other Party of the likely period required to cure the Force Majeure and recommence performance. 
 


 
(c)
If a Party terminates this Agreement as a result of a Force Majeure event, each Partys liability shall be limited to any claims or right to damages as expressly
provided in this Agreement which have accrued prior to termination and no Party shall be liable for any other Loss arising out of, in relation to or in connection with the termination or as a consequence of termination under this Agreement, in tort
(including negligence), under statute (to the extent permitted), in equity or otherwise (including negligent misrepresentation or in restitution).   


16.7
End of Force Majeure   


 
(a)
The Affected Party shall:   


 
(i)
recommence the performance of its obligations under this Agreement immediately upon the cessation of the event or effects of Force Majeure; and

   34 









 
(ii)
give notice to the Parties immediately upon the cessation of the event or effects of Force Majeure. 
 


 
(b)
Under no circumstances will an event of Force Majeure result in the extension of the Term. 
 


17.
DEFAULT AND TERMINATION   


17.1
Default by Buyer   


 
(a)
If a Buyer has committed a Financial Default or a default under clause 23.1(a) and such default is not excused under this Agreement, the Seller may give a notice
to the Buyer specifying reasonable details of the default (Sellers Default Notice) and, without limiting any rights of the Seller under this Agreement in respect of the default, thereafter the Parties may confer to discuss the cause,
effect of and prospects for curing the default.   


 
(b)
Upon the Buyers receipt of the Sellers Default Notice, the Seller may at any time after the date of the Buyers receipt of the Sellers Default
Notice, reduce or suspend deliveries of Gas to that Buyer during the continuation of such default until the default is cured or this Agreement is terminated. 
 


 
(c)
 If the default by the Buyer has extended beyond the date of the Sellers Default Notice for a period of more than ten (10) Business Days for
a Financial Default or more than thirty (30) Business Days for a default under clause 23.1(a), then the Seller may by written notice (Sellers Termination Notice) terminate this Agreement effective at any time following the tenth
(10th) Business Day for a Financial Default or the
thirtieth (30th) Business Day for default under
clause 23.1(a) from the Buyers receipt of the Sellers Termination Notice as may be stated in the Sellers Termination Notice provided that termination will not occur if the default is cured prior to the effective date of such
termination as stated in the Sellers Termination Notice.   


 
(d)
Termination of this Agreement as to any one Buyer shall not terminate, impair, or diminish the obligations or rights of the other Buyer under this Agreement, and this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect as between the Seller and such non-defaulting Buyer. No default as to any one Buyer shall be interpreted or deemed to be a default by the other Buyer or to give rise to any rights or remedies against
the non-defaulting Buyer.   


17.2
Default by the Seller   


 
(a)
If the Seller has committed a Financial Default or a default under clause 23.1 (a) and such default is not excused under this Agreement, any affected Buyer may

(b)
 The Buyer may by written notice (Buyers Termination Notice) terminate this Agreement effective at any time following the tenth (10th) Business Day for a Financial Default or the thirtieth
(30th) Business Day for a default under clause

of such termination as stated in the Buyers Termination Notice.   


17.3
Other Defaults and Remedies   


 
(a)
If a Party commits a default of an obligation under this Agreement (other than a Financial Default or a default under clause 23.1(a)) and such default is not excused
under this Agreement, the non-defaulting Party may give a notice to such Defaulting Party specifying reasonable details of the default (Default Notice) and the Defaulting Party must diligently seek to cure the default (if it is
rectifiable). 
   35 









 
(b)
The non-defaulting Partys remedies in respect of a default other than Financial Default or default under clause 23.1 (a) include claims for Direct Loss
(excluding damages of the type disallowed under clause 18), specific performance and injunction, but for avoidance of doubt a Party may only terminate this Agreement for Financial Default or default under clause 23.1(a), and all other termination
rights at law or in equity are hereby excluded. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in the event of a default which is compensable under both this clause 17.3 and under either or both of clauses 8.5 and 12.2, the cumulative damages payable
under this clause 17.3 and under any one or more of clauses 8.5 and 12.2 shall not, in the aggregate, exceed the amounts due and payable under clauses 8.5 and 12.2, whichever one or both may be applicable. 
 


17.4
Survival  Notwithstanding
termination of this Agreement for any reason, clauses 2(d), 3, 8.6(h), 18, 20, 22, 24 and 25.3 and the rights and obligations hereunder that by their nature are intended to survive termination shall remain in effect to the full extent permitted by
law until all obligations have been extinguished and all disputes have been resolved.   


18.
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY   


 
(a)
Subject to clause 18(b), but notwithstanding any other term or condition of this Agreement, the liability of a Party for Loss arising out of any matter or circumstance
giving rise to a claim in connection with this Agreement is limited to Direct Loss and no Party is liable to any other Party in respect of, and each Party covenants to the other Parties that it shall not make any claim or enforce, any liability or
indemnity against any other Party for any Loss other than Direct Loss, howsoever arising (including, but not limited to, by the negligence of any Party) suffered or incurred by such Party in respect of any circumstances under, in relation to or in
connection with this Agreement, whether arising under contract, at common law, in equity, in tort (including negligence) or under statute (to the maximum extent permitted by law) or otherwise (including negligent misrepresentation or in
restitution).   


 
(b)
Clause 18(a) does not apply to, diminish or limit a Partys obligation to pay or reimburse the specified damages or amounts due as set out in clauses 8.4, 8.5(b),
8.6(h), 9.2, 11.1, 11.4 and 12.2(c).

(f)
