ARTICLE I

GRANT

 

1.1           Grant.  Mortgagor, for good and valuable consideration, receipt acknowledged, does hereby mortgage, grant, bargain, sell, assign, transfer, convey and warrant, together with power of sale, to Mortgagee, the rights, titles and interests in and to the real and personal property interests (herein sometimes called the “Leases”) and the oil, gas and/or mineral rights and interests therein, of any nature or kind including mineral interests and royalty interests (herein sometimes called the “Mineral Interests”) as more specifically described on Schedule A attached hereto (Collectively the “Mortgaged Properties”) and by this reference incorporated herein, subject, however, to the provisions of Section 1.4.

 

TO HAVE AND TO HOLD the Mortgaged Properties unto Mortgagee, and Mortgagee’s successors and assigns, forever, in accordance with the terms and provisions hereof, subject, however, to the provisions of Section 1.4.

 

1.2     Disclaimer of Warranties.  This Mortgage is made without warranty of title, expressed, implied or statutory.  WITHOUT LIMITATION OF THE GENERALITY OF THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING SENTENCE, MORTGAGOR HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS AND NEGATES ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESSED, IMPLIED, AT COMMON LAW, BY CODE, BY STATUTE, OR OTHERWISE RELATING TO THE CONDITION OF THE MORTGAGED PROPERTIES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED OR EXPRESSED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE), IT BEING THE INTENTION OF MORTGAGOR AND MORTGAGEE THAT THE MORTGAGED ASSETS ARE TO BE MORTGAGED “AS IS, WHERE IS” AND IN THEIR PRESENT CONDITION AND STATE OF REPAIR.

 

1.3           Avoidance Laws.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Mortgage to the contrary, Mortgagor’s liability for the Indebtedness shall be limited to an amount not to exceed as of any date of determination the amount which could be claimed by Mortgagee from Mortgagor under this Mortgage without rendering such claim voidable or avoidable under Section 548 of Title 11 of the United States Code or under the Montana Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or similar statute or at common law (the “Avoidance Laws”) after taking into account, inter alia, Mortgagor’s right of contribution from any other person. To the end set forth above, but only to the extent that the Indebtedness would otherwise be subject to avoidance under the Avoidance Laws, if Mortgagor is not deemed to have received valuable consideration, fair value, fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for the Indebtedness, or if the Indebtedness would render Mortgagor insolvent, or leave Mortgagor with unreasonably small capital to conduct its business, or cause Mortgagor to have incurred debts (or to have intended to have incurred debts) beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature, in each case as of the time any of the Indebtedness is deemed to have been incurred for the purposes of the Avoidance Laws, the maximum Indebtedness for which Mortgagor shall be liable under this Mortgage shall be reduced to that amount which, after giving effect thereto, would not cause the Indebtedness as so reduced, to be subject to avoidance under the Avoidance Laws; provided, however, that the limitations contained in this Section 1.3 shall apply only in the event a valid claim is made by a third party creditor that this Mortgage constitutes a fraudulent transfer or a fraudulent obligation and then only to the extent necessary to avoid such claim.

 

1.4           Defeasance.  If all Indebtedness be irrevocably paid as the same becomes due and payable and if the covenants, warranties, undertakings and agreements made in this instrument are kept and performed, then and in that case only, this Mortgage shall have no force and effect, this conveyance shall become null and void, the Mortgaged Properties hereby conveyed shall become wholly clear of the liens, conveyances, assignments and security interests evidenced hereby, and all such liens, conveyances, assignments and security interests shall be released in due form at Mortgagor’s cost. Mortgagee shall, within 30 calendar days after receiving, by certified or registered mail, a request in writing for the discharge or release of this Mortgage, execute, acknowledge and deliver a certificate of discharge and/or release if there has been full and irrevocable performance of this Mortgage.

1.5           Warranty of Title to Leases.  With the exception of that well or pipeline lien filed in the records of McCone County, Montana as document #85262 by Wellpro, Inc., as claimant, against Mortgagor, in the amount of $1,170.33, Mortgagor has not alienated or encumbered the Mortgaged Properties and the Mortgaged Properties are now free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, and other claims of third parties, created by, through or under Mortgagor but not otherwise.

 

1.6           Subordination.  The Secured Loans made by Mortgagee to Mortgagor pursuant to the Loan Agreement and secured by this Mortgage, Security Agreement and Financing Statement shall be subordinate in payment to the Bridge Notes in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $750,000 made pursuant to that certain Financing Agreement referenced in the Mortgage, Security Agreement and Financing Statement between the Mortgagee and the Mortgagor dated July 25, 2011.

The terms “Default” and “Event of Default” as used in this instrument shall each mean the Mortgagee’s declaration of a default upon the occurrence of any of the following:




 

(i)           default in the punctual payment of the Indebtedness as and when due and payable, and Mortgagor shall fail to cure such default in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents:  or

 

(ii)           Mortgagor or any obligor, guarantor or surety of any Indebtedness secured hereby, shall file a voluntary petition in bankruptcy proceeding, shall consent to voluntary or involuntary adjudication to bankruptcy or to reorganization (and 90 calendar days expire without dismissal thereof), or shall be adjudged bankrupt or insolvent under any applicable law or laws, or admits, in writing to having become insolvent, or becomes unable to pay debts as they mature, or suspends doing business, or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or shall apply for, or consents to, the appointment of a trustee or receiver for a substantial portion of its assets (and 90 calendar days expire without dismissal of such appointment).

b.


Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, Mortgagee may at its option declare the Indebtedness to be forthwith due and payable, whereupon the same shall become due and payable without any presentment, demand, protest, notice of protest, notice of intent to accelerate, notice of acceleration or notice of any kind, all of which are all hereby waived.  Mortgagee shall notify Mortgagor of its exercise of such option within five business days thereof.




 





  


c.


Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, and in every such case, Mortgagee may, subject to the rights of any superior lien holder:




 

(i)           Proceed to protect and enforce its rights by a suit or suits in equity or at law, either for the specific performance of any covenant or agreement contained herein, or in aid of the execution of any power herein granted, or for the foreclosure of this Mortgage or for the enforcement of any other appropriate legal or equitable remedies.

 

(ii)           Pursuant to the power of sale hereby granted, cause the Mortgaged Properties to be sold by power of sale to satisfy the Indebtedness. Mortgagee shall give such notice as the law then requires as a condition precedent to foreclosure by power of sale. When the minimum period of time required by law after such notice has elapsed, Mortgagee or at Mortgagee’s discretion, any other person qualified by law, without notice to or demand upon Mortgagor except as required by law, shall sell the Mortgaged Properties at the time and place of sale affixed by it in the notice of sale, at one or several sales, either as a whole or in separate parcels and in such manner and order, all as Mortgagee in its sole discretion may determine, at public auction to the highest bidder for cash, and lawful money of the United States, payable at time of sale. Neither Mortgagor nor any other person or entity other than Mortgagee shall have the right to direct the order in which the Mortgaged Properties are sold, except as required by law. Subject to requirements and limits imposed by law, Mortgagee may, from time to time, postpone the sale of all or any portion of the Mortgaged Properties by inserting a notice of such postponement in the newspaper in which the original advertisement was published and continuing such publication until the time to which the sale shall be postponed. A sale of less than the whole of the Mortgaged Properties or any defective or irregular sale made hereunder shall not exhaust the power of sale provided for herein. Proceeds from the sale of the Mortgaged Properties shall be applied according to applicable law.

 

(iii)           To the extent permitted by law, resort to and realize upon the security hereunder and any other security now or later held by Mortgagee concurrently or successively in one or several consolidated or independent judicial actions or lawfully taken non-judicial proceedings, or both, and to apply the proceeds received upon the Indebtedness all in such order and manner as Mortgagee determines in its sole discretion and to the extent provided by law.

 

(iv)           In any action to foreclose, appoint a receiver of the rents, issues and profits of the Mortgaged Properties as a matter of right and without notice, with power to collect the rents, issues, proceeds, income and profits, without regard to the value of the Mortgaged Properties or the solvency of any person or persons liable for the payment of the Indebtedness involved in the action. Mortgagor, for itself and any subsequent owner or owners, hereby waives any and all defenses to the application for a receiver as provided above and hereby specifically consents to such appointment without notice; but nothing contained herein is to be construed to deprive Mortgagee of any other right, remedy or privilege it may now have under the law to have a receiver appointed. The provisions for the appointment of a receiver are made an express condition upon which the loans contemplated by the Agreement are made.

d.


Mortgagor shall surrender possession of the Mortgaged Properties to the purchaser at foreclosure sale immediately following the sale in the event such possession has not previously been delivered by Mortgagor.




 





  


e.


In connection with any sale or sales hereunder, Mortgagee may elect to treat any of the Mortgaged Properties which consists of a right in action or which is property that can be severed from the Mortgaged Properties (including, without limitation, any improvements forming a part thereof) without causing damage thereto as if the same were personal property or a fixture, as the case may be, and dispose of the same in accordance with applicable law, separate and apart from the sale of the Mortgaged Properties. Any sale of Collateral (as hereinafter defined) hereunder shall be conducted in any manner permitted by the Uniform Commercial Code.




 





  


f.


The recitals in any deed, assignment or other conveyance given by Mortgagee or public officer of a default, publication of notice of sale, demand that a sale should be made, postponement of sale, terms of sale, sale, name of purchaser, payment of purchase money and any other facts affecting the regularity or validity of the sale shall be prima facie evidence of the truthfulness thereof, and such deed, assignment or other conveyance shall be conclusive against all persons as to all matters or facts therein recited.




 





  


g.


In addition to all other remedies granted Mortgagee herein, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, Mortgagor, upon demand by Mortgagee, shall permit such third parties as Mortgagee may designate to inspect the Mortgaged Properties and Mortgagor’s operations thereon.




 





  


h.


All remedies herein expressly provided for are cumulative of any and all other remedies now existing at law or in equity, and Mortgagee shall, in addition to the remedies provided for above, be entitled to avail itself of all such other remedies as may now or hereafter exist at law or in equity for the collection of the Indebtedness and the enforcement of the covenants herein and foreclosure of the liens evidenced hereby. The resort to any remedy provided for by law shall not prevent the concurrent or subsequent employment of any other appropriate remedy.




 





  


i.


To the extent permitted by law, Mortgagee shall have the right to become the purchaser at any sale held by Mortgagee or any public officer. If Mortgagee becomes the purchaser at any such sale, Mortgagee shall have the right to credit the Indebtedness, or a portion thereof, upon the amount of the bid made therefor.




 





  


j.


Mortgagee may resort to any security given by this instrument or to any other security now existing or hereafter given to secure the payment of the Indebtedness, in whole or in part, and in such portions and in such order as may seem best to Mortgagee in its sole and uncontrolled discretion.

k.


In the Event of Default but subject to the rights of any superior lien holder, if any, Mortgagor hereby absolutely and unconditionally bargains, sells, transfers, assigns, sets over and conveys to Mortgagee, Mortgagor’s interest in the Hydrocarbons, together with its share of the proceeds derived from the sale thereof (such proceeds being hereinafter called “proceeds of production”). In the Event of Default but subject to the rights of any superior lien holder, Mortgagor directs and instructs each purchaser of the Hydrocarbons to pay to Mortgagee all of the proceeds of production until such time as such purchaser has been furnished evidence that all Indebtedness has been paid and that the lien evidenced hereby has been released. Mortgagor authorizes Mortgagee to receive and collect all sums of money derived from the proceeds of production, and no purchaser of the Hydrocarbons shall have the responsibility for the application of any funds paid to Mortgagee. Mortgagor shall execute and deliver any and all transfer orders, division orders and other instruments that may be requested by Mortgagee or that may be required by the purchaser of the Hydrocarbons for the purpose of effectuating payment of proceeds of production to Mortgagee. Mortgagor hereby appoints Mortgagee as its attorney-in-fact to pursue any and all rights to collect proceeds of production and to execute and deliver any and all transfer orders, division orders and other instruments that may be required by the purchaser of Hydrocarbons. This power of attorney is coupled with an interest and therefore irrevocable in the Event of Default.

It is further agreed that without limitation of the foregoing, all calculations of the rate of interest contracted for, taken, charged or received under the Note or this Mortgage that are made for the purpose of determining whether such rate exceeds the maximum lawful contract rate, shall be made, to the extent permitted by the applicable usury laws, now or hereafter enacted, by amortizing, prorating, allocating and spreading in equal parts during the period of the full stated term of the loans evidenced by the instruments evidencing the Indebtedness, all interest at any time contracted for, taken, charged or received from Mortgagor or otherwise by Mortgagee in connection with such loans.
