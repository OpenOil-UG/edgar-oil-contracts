Carbon Natural Gas Company

2014 Annual Incentive Plan

 

Plan Administration

 

The Plan will be administered by the Committee and the Chief Executive Officer (for all positions except his own).  The Chief Financial Officer will verify the performance calculation for the financial and operating measures in consultation with the President, who shall be responsible for the estimation of the Company’s oil and gas reserves.




The CEO will establish the Incentive Award Pool for the non-officer employees and will allocate Incentive Awards to the Pool Participants at his discretion.




The Board cannot increase payout amounts above the outstanding level under performance categories that depend on the achievement of specific Company targets. Payments related to performance categories that are tied to the achievement of specific targets are capped once the highest level is achieved.  The Board can, in its reasonable discretion, reduce or increase the payout amounts for these performance categories after taking into account special or unusual factors that may have contributed to the achievement of target performance measures such as acquisitions, commodity prices or other factors considered appropriate by the Board.




Award Achievement Levels




Award Achievement Levels for the Plan will be:







●

Threshold


Minimum level at which Incentive Award payouts occur


 
  
  

●

Target


Level at which the participant receives the Incentive Target Award percentage.


 
  
  

●

Outstanding


Level at which the participant receives 200% of the Incentive Target Award percentage.




 

Completion percentages between Threshold, Target and Outstanding will be determined by interpolation.





Targets can be adjusted for material changes made during the year to the business plan or scope thereof, including the capital expenditure budget.

Performance Levels




Performance levels will be set for each measure.  Performance results below the Threshold will equate to a zero completion percentage.




A minimum 30% completion threshold is required for the total Plan in order for Award payments to be made under the Plan.




Completion Calculation




Completion percentages for each individual measure will be equal to the calculated completion percentage of the measure times the weighting for that measure. The overall completion percentage for the Plan for financial and operating measures and department objectives will be the sum of the weighted completion percentages for each individual measure.




Participants




The CEO shall determine which employees are to be participants in the Plan.  If a participant’s employment with the Company terminates for any reason prior to payment, bonus awards (if any) will be paid at the discretion of the Board of Directors.




The Target Award percentages for the CEO and other officers of the Company (Exhibit A) are established by the Board of Directors.  Changes to Target Award percentages for Company officers are subject to the approval of the Board. The CEO is authorized to establish and adjust at his discretion the Target Award percentages for non-officer Plan participants and the allocation of incentive awards to the pool participants. All awards to officers under the Plan are subject to approval of the Board.




Incentive  Awards will be calculated based upon the participant’s average base salary during the Plan year or earned salary during the Plan year if the participant was a new hire during the year, took a leave of absence, or was absent due to a worker’s compensation issue.
