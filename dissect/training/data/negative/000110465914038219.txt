For purposes of this Agreement, Texas Claims means, collectively, claims with respect to: (a) the Sweet Home Litigation Proceeds, (b) the right of Hess to have received the overriding royalty interests granted by ZaZa Parent to Hess Parent in connection with the consummation of the transactions under the Texas DOA and the obligation of Hess to amend the terms of any such overriding royalty interest, (c) disparaging statements allegedly made by a Party or any of its respective Representatives with respect to any other Party or such other Partys Affiliates, and (d) the final settlement statement delivered in connection with the Texas DOA and the amounts owing thereunder.
 






 
SCHEDULE 1
 
ARBITRATION PROVISIONS
 
1.             The arbitration shall be conducted by three arbitrators, unless the Parties agree to a sole arbitrator within thirty (30) days after the filing of the arbitration. For greater certainty, for purposes of this Schedule 1, the filing of the arbitration means the date on which the claimants request for arbitration is received by the other Parties.
 
2.             If the arbitration is to be conducted by a sole arbitrator, then the arbitrator will be jointly selected by the Hess Parties and the ZaZa Parties.  If the Parties fail to agree on the arbitrator within thirty (30) days after the filing of the arbitration, then the ICC shall appoint the arbitrator.
 
3.             If the arbitration is to be conducted by three arbitrators, the Hess Parties shall nominate one co-arbitrator and the ZaZa Parties shall nominate a co-arbitrator. The two co-arbitrators shall, in coordination with the Party that appointed them, then nominate a third arbitrator, who shall serve as the presiding arbitrator.   If either the Hess Parties or the ZaZa Parties fail to appoint their arbitrator or if the appointed arbitrators cannot reach an agreement on the presiding arbitrator within the applicable time period set out in the ICC Rules, then the ICC shall appoint the remainder of the three arbitrators not yet appointed.
 
4.             If the Parties initiate multiple arbitration proceedings, the subject matters of which are related by common questions of law or fact and could result in conflicting awards or obligations, then all such proceedings may be consolidated into a single arbitral proceeding.
 
5.             Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties in writing, the place of arbitration shall be Houston, Texas.  The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in the English language and the arbitrator(s) shall be fluent in the English language.  The Parties agree that discovery and evidence in the arbitration shall be governed by the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Commercial Arbitration.  Subject to any relevant legal privilege against disclosure, the arbitration tribunal shall have the power to make all orders necessary for the disclosure contemplated above, which orders the Parties consent in advance to obey.
 
6.             The award of the arbitral tribunal shall be final and binding.  Judgment on the award of the arbitral tribunal may be entered and enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction.
 
7.             The single arbitrator or the presiding arbitrator (as the case may be) shall be a citizen of the United States of America, unless the Parties otherwise agree.
 
8.             Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may apply to a court for interim measures (a) prior to the constitution of the arbitral tribunal (and thereafter as necessary to enforce the arbitral tribunals rulings); or (b) in the absence of the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal to rule on interim measures in a given jurisdiction.  The Parties agree that seeking and obtaining such interim measures shall not waive the right to arbitration.  The arbitrators (or in an emergency the presiding arbitrator acting alone in the event one or more of the other arbitrators is unable to be involved in a timely fashion) may grant interim measures including injunctions, attachments and conservation orders in
 






 
appropriate circumstances, which measures may be immediately enforced by court order.  Hearings on requests for interim measures may be held in person, by telephone, by video conference or by other means that permit the Parties to present evidence and arguments.
 
9.              Each Party will bear its own attorneys fees.  The costs of the arbitration proceedings will be borne ½ by the Hess Parties and ½ by the ZaZa Parties.
 
10.       The award shall include interest, as determined by the arbitral award, from the date of any default or other breach of this Agreement until the arbitral award is paid in full.  Interest shall be awarded at the Prime Rate (as published in the Wall Street Journal).
 
11.       The arbitral award shall be made and payable in United States dollars, free of any tax or other deduction.
 
12.       The Parties waive their rights to claim or recover, and the arbitral tribunal shall not award, any punitive, multiple, or other exemplary damages (whether statutory or common law).
 
13.       To the extent permitted by law, any right to appeal or challenge any arbitral decision or award, or to oppose enforcement of any such decision or award before a court or any governmental authority, is hereby waived by the Parties except with respect to the limited grounds for modification or non-enforcement provided by any applicable arbitration statute or treaty.
 
14.       All negotiations, mediation, arbitration, and expert determinations relating to a any dispute between the Parties (including a settlement resulting from negotiation or mediation, an arbitral award, documents exchanged or produced during a mediation or arbitration proceeding, and memorials, briefs or other documents prepared for the arbitration) are confidential and shall not be disclosed to any Person that is not a Party to this Agreement or an Affiliate thereof (such Person, a Third Party) by either Party, except to the extent necessary to (a) enforce this Schedule 1 or any arbitration order or award (or court order related to the arbitration); (b) to enforce or defend the rights of a Party, or as required by law; (c) comply with the disclosure requirements of applicable securities laws; or (d) allow Third Party professionals employed by a Party to perform their respective services; provided, however, that breach of this confidentiality provision shall not void any settlement, expert determination or award.
