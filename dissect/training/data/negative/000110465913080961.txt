12






 
4.2.2                     (a) If KOSMOS decides, pursuant to Section 15 of the Decree, to enter into the First Extension Period of two (2) years and six (6) months duration from the end of the Initial Period, KOSMOS will be committed to carry out the following Minimum Exploration Work Program:
 
·1) Drilling of an Exploration Well to a minimum depth of two thousand seven hundred and fifty (2,750) meters below seabed or to the Cretaceous objective, whichever is penetrated first; and
·2) Evaluation of the results of such Exploration Well.
 
The estimated cost of such Minimum Exploration Work Program is  thirty million US Dollars (US $30,000,000).
 
(b) After having completed the Minimum Exploration Work Program referred to in paragraph (a) above, or subject to making the payment required in respect thereof pursuant to Articles 4.2.5. and 4.2.6, KOSMOS shall notify ONHYM of its intention to abandon all its interest in the Exploration Permits, or of its intention to enter into the Second Extension Period.
 
4.2.3                    (a) If KOSMOS decides, pursuant to Section 15 of the Decree, to enter into the Second Extension Period of three (3) years duration from the end of the First Extension Period, KOSMOS will be committed to carry out the following Minimum Exploration Work Program:
 
·1) Drilling of an Exploration Well to a minimum depth of two thousand seven hundred and fifty (2,750) meters below seabed or to the Cretaceous objective, whichever is penetrated first; and
·2)  Evaluation of the results of such Exploration Well.
 
The estimated cost of such Minimum Exploration Work Program is thirty million US Dollars (US $30,000,000)
 
(b) After having completed the Minimum Exploration Work Program referred to in paragraph (a) above, or subject to making the payment requested in respect thereof pursuant to Articles 4.2.5 and 4.2.6, KOSMOS shall notify ONHYM of its intention to abandon all its interest in the Exploration Permits.
 
4.2.4                    KOSMOS shall provide ONHYM with irrevocable on first demand Bank Guarantees acceptable to ONHYM in order to secure the completion of the Minimum Exploration Work Programs set out in Articles 4.2.1, 4.2.2 and 4.2.3 as follows:
 
(a)         No later than the date of signature of this Agreement, KOSMOS shall provide a Bank Guarantee on first demand for an amount of   two million US Dollars (US$2,000,000), in order to guarantee the fulfillment of the Minimum Exploration Work Program set out in Article 4.2.1(a).  The amount of the bank guarantee will be reduced to five hundred
 
13







 
thousand US Dollars (US$ 500,000) at the remittance by Kosmos of the field tapes and support data from the 1200 km2 of Multi Azimuth 3D Seismic acquired pursuant to paragraph 4.2.1 (a) (1).  Another two hundred fifty thousand US Dollars (US$ 250,000) will be released at the remittance of the processed 3D seismic data.  The outstanding amount of two hundred fifty thousand US Dollars (US$ 250,000) will be released at the remittance by Kosmos of all the reports deriving from the Minimum Exploration Work Program for the Initial Period.
 
(b)   Each time KOSMOS decides to enter into an Extension Period pursuant to Articles 4.2.2 and 4.2.3, at the time of such application KOSMOS shall provide a Bank Guarantee on first demand for an amount of five million US Dollars (US$ 5,000,000) in addition to the drilling contract of the committed well. In the event KOSMOS does not provide the drilling contract, the amount of the Bank Guarantee will be twelve million US Dollars (US$ 12,000,000). Once a drilling contract is provided the Bank Guarantee will be reduced to five million US Dollars (US$5,000,000). The Bank Guarantee, as stated in this paragraph, will be put in place in order to guarantee the fulfillment of the Minimum Exploration Work Program set out in Articles 4.2.2(a) and 4.2.3(a) respectively.
 
4.2.5       KOSMOS shall notify ONHYM when KOSMOS has completed the Exploration Work in a Minimum Exploration Work Program for an Exploration Period, and ONHYM shall, if the Bank Guarantee is due to be released pursuant to Article 4.2.4, within fifteen (15) days of such notice from KOSMOS, give a notification to the Bank to release the Bank Guarantee or notify KOSMOS that it disagrees that such Minimum Exploration Work Program has been completed. The Bank Guarantee shall be released at the relevant expiry date specified in Article 4.2.4, unless a payment is due under Article 4.2.6., in which case the Bank Guarantee will be released when such payment is made.
 
Except in case of Force Majeure and as provided in Article 4.2.6, if KOSMOS does not fulfil totally or partially the Minimum Exploration Work Program for a particular Exploration Period to which it is committed under Articles 4.2.1, 4.2.2 or 4.2.3, ONHYM shall call the Bank Guarantee in conformity with the terms and conditions set out in Clause 7 of the Association Contract.
 
4.2.6       It is the intention of the Parties that the Exploration Work set out in the Minimum Exploration Work Programs shall be carried out by KOSMOS as a minimum commitment. However, if for any reason other than Force Majeure, KOSMOS has not completed the Minimum Exploration Work Program for a particular Exploration Period to which it is committed under Articles 4.2.1, 4.2.2 or 4.2.3 then KOSMOS shall pay a penalty equal to the estimated cost of the Minimum Exploration Work Program set out in the relevant Article for the applicable period. Provided, however, that in the event of technical difficulties, including but not limited to encountering impenetrable substances, high pressures, wellbore instability, mechanical failures, unsafe conditions or other conditions, which KOSMOS is not able to overcome using good and prudent oil field practices, and such technical difficulties prevent KOSMOS from fulfilling the Minimum Exploration Work Program, KOSMOS may cease operations and will be deemed to have fulfilled the
 
14






 
Minimum Exploration Work Program set out in the relevant Article.
 
Additionally, if and insofar as any Exploration Work in the Minimum Exploration Work Programs detailed in Articles 4.2.2 and 4.2.3 which has already been carried out by KOSMOS prior to the commencement of the applicable Extension Period, such Exploration Work shall be credited to KOSMOS for the purpose of fulfilling the Minimum Exploration Work Program set out in Articles 4.2.2 and 4.2.3, as the case may be.
 
It is understood between the Parties that, in case ONHYM did call the Bank Guarantee according to Article 4.2.5., the amount of such bank Guarantee, if already paid to ONHYM, will be deducted from the amount of the penalty due to be paid according to the first paragraph of this Article 4.2.6. If the amount of the Bank Guarantee is not paid to ONHYM, the amount of the penalty will be equal to the estimated cost of the Minimum Exploration Work Program set out in the relevant Article.
 
4.2.7       Subject to Article 4.2.6, it is understood and expressly agreed, that it is the performance of the Minimum Exploration Work Program and not the expenditures associated with the estimated cost thereof which shall determine KOSMOSs compliance with this Agreement.  Performance of the Minimum Exploration Work Program shall be deemed to constitute the fulfillment of all obligations related to payment of the estimated costs provided in Articles 4.2.1, 4.2.2, and 4.2.3 for the applicable period.
 
4.2.8       Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 3.1, all costs incurred in carrying out Exploration Work shall be borne entirely by KOSMOS, without any obligation for ONHYM to provide any reimbursement.
 
4.2.9       Furthermore, ONHYM has the right to control and audit expenditures relating to Exploration Works incurred by KOSMOS during the Initial Period and any Extension Periods in order to control the fulfilment of the Minimum Exploration Work Program.

PART III
 
EXPLOITATION CONCESSION(S)
 
16






 
ARTICLE 5
 
HYDROCARBON EXPLOITATION
 
5.1          In accordance with the provisions of Section 27 of the Law, the discovery of a commercially exploitable Hydrocarbon deposit shall give the Parties the right to obtain, at their request, an Exploitation Concession covering all of the area of said deposit. The maximum duration of the Exploitation Concession shall be twenty-five (25) years. However, one single exceptional extension, not to exceed ten (10) years, may be granted, upon joint application by the Parties if the rational and economic exploitation of the deposit so justifies; ONHYM and KOSMOS shall jointly apply the procedure to obtain the aforementioned exceptional extension.
 
5.2          Subject to any assignment in accordance with Article 17, the indivisible Percentage Interest of the Parties in each of the Exploitation Concession(s) shall be:
 



KOSMOS    

75%       


ONHYM    

25%         
 
5.3          Expenses for Development and Exploitation Work in respect of a Hydrocarbons deposit, incurred after the declaration made in accordance with the provisions of the Hydrocarbon Code and the Association Contract that such deposit contains commercially exploitable quantities, shall be funded by the Parties in proportion to their respective Percentage Interests. However ONHYM shall not be required to commence the payment of its share of such expenses until the effective date of the relevant Exploitation Concession.
 
5.4          The Parties, each being the sole owner at the point of production of their respective Percentage Interest shares in the Hydrocarbons produced from the Exploitation Concession(s), shall each have the right to take, dispose of and separately sell their share of Available Crude Oil and Available Natural Gas.
 
No later than ninety (90) days before commencement of production from the Exploitation Concession, the Parties shall sign an agreement (the Lifting Agreement) the terms of which shall govern and facilitate the separate lifting of Crude Oil by the Parties. The Lifting Agreement shall detail, inter alia, terms relating to each Partys share in the Crude Oil, the timetable for lifting nominations by the Parties, under/overlift provisions, cargo procedures, vessel capacity acceptance procedures and failure to lift provisions.
 
In accordance with Section 41 of the Law, KOSMOS must, before contemplating export of its share of production of Available Crude Oil, contribute to the needs of the local market of Morocco. The price of the sold Available Crude Oil in the domestic market shall be the Market Price as determined pursuant to Article 6. The portion so required to be sold by
 
17






 
KOSMOS in any calendar year shall not (unless otherwise agreed between the Parties) exceed the lesser of the quantities determined according to the following ratios): either twenty percent (20%)of KOSMOSs share of Available Crude Oil or KOSMOSs share of the domestic market deficit as measured by the ratio of KOSMOSs share of Available Crude Oil to the total production of Crude Oil under all petroleum agreements concluded in Morocco.
 
5.5          In the case of Natural Gas, the Parties will use their best endeavors to find domestic and foreign markets for such Natural Gas.
 
If the Parties agree that the quantity of Natural Gas discovered requires the construction of export facilities, in addition to domestic market facilities, the Parties shall determine, after having informed the STATE, respective quantities to be reserved for the domestic market and for export customers having entered into long-term contracts. ONHYM shall use its best endeavors to assist KOSMOS to obtain all necessary licenses and authorisations for the construction of such facilities.
 
18






 
ARTICLE 6
 
MARKET PRICE
 
6.1          The Market Price in Dollars as determined in accordance with this Article 6 shall be used for the calculation of the royalty in cash and of the corporate tax pursuant to Section 46 of the Law.
 
6.2          The Market Price for Crude Oil shall be determined each Quarter for each of the Parties, as follows:
 
(a)           Except in the case of sales of Crude Oil which do not meet the conditions set out below in Article 6.2 (b) or which are excluded by Article 6.5, the Market Price shall be the actual price received by the Party in question for sales of Crude Oil in the relevant period. Market Price shall be determined separately for each type of Crude Oil or Crude Oil blend and for each place of loading.
 
Such actual prices shall be adjusted to the price per Barrel, F.O.B. place of loading in Morocco.
 
(b)           Actual prices shall only be used if they are obtained from customers who generally purchase on a regular basis pursuant to purchase contracts contemplating liftings over a period of at least ninety (90) days or from spot sales under arms length transactions, including contracts notified under Article 6.2 (c).
 
(c)           If Crude Oil is to be sold by a Party under a long term contract with its Affiliate at a price based on the published prices of Crude Oil on the international market, adjusted in particular to account for differences in quality and transport, then such Party shall submit a copy of the contract to the appropriate department of the STATE.
 
6.3          If, during a given Quarter, a Party has made Crude Oil sales that do not fall under Article 6.2, the price to be applied to such sales shall be the Market Price per barrel determined in accordance with Article 6.2 for the sales of said Party.
 
6.4          If there are no sales of Crude Oil within a Quarter by a Party which fall within Article 6.2, then the Market Price for the Party concerned will be determined by agreement between the appropriate departments of the STATE and such Party.
 
Such Market Price shall be based upon weighted average sales prices in Dollars in the past preceding Quarter of a basket of leading types of Crude Oils produced in major Crude Oil producing countries in the Arabian-Persian Gulf, Mediterranean, or in Africa, which are quoted and regularly sold on the open market. The composition and weighting of the said basket shall be agreed between the STATE and the Party(ies) concerned, and may be adjusted to reflect the individual characteristics of the particular Crude Oil or Crude Oil
 
19






 
blend produced, taking into consideration positive or negative adjustments generally applied in the international petroleum industry (corrections for quality, transportation, etc.). The intent of this provision is to determine the Market Price in foreign currency that is obtainable generally in arms-length transactions, on the open market from customers regularly purchasing on competitive commercial terms.
 
In determining the Market Price of Crude Oil produced under this Agreement pursuant to this Article 6.4, the STATE and the Party(ies) shall consider all available relevant data, including the weighted average actual prices, F.O.B. (INCOTERMS 2000 by the International Chamber of Commerce  I.C.C and its future updates), exclusive of any marketing fee, of any export sales by the Parties or by their Affiliates to third parties that are non-Affiliates.
 
6.5          Prices of the following types of sales shall not be considered in fixing Market Price:
 
(i)      Sales, whether direct or indirect, through brokers or otherwise, by any Party to any Affiliate of such Party, unless such sales are under a contract submitted to the STATE under Article 6.2(c) (except where the STATE has notified the Party, giving its reasons, within sixty (60) days of submission, that it is not satisfied with the terms of such contract submitted under Article 6.2(c), because it does not agree on the Fair Value of the price  for such contract).
 
(ii)     Sales involving a quid pro quo other than payment in a foreign currency or motivated in whole or in part by considerations other than the usual economic incentives for arms-length Crude Oil sales, for example, sales influenced by or involving special dealings, relations between governments or barter transactions.
 
6.6          If the STATE and the relevant Party fail to agree under Article 6.4 on Market Price for any Crude Oil for any Quarter by at least fifteen (15) days after the end of that Quarter, either of them, with notice to the other, may submit, for determination by a single arbitrator designated by the International Center of Technical Expertise of the International Chamber of Commerce (I.C.C.), the question, what single price per Barrel, in the arbitrators judgment, performed under I.C.C. rules and procedures, best represents the Market Price of that Crude Oil for the pertinent Quarter.
 
If the STATE does notify a Party that it is not satisfied that the price under a contract submitted under Article 6.2(c) is Fair Value, the question of whether the price under the contract is Fair Value may be submitted for arbitration on the same basis as set out in the above paragraph.
 
The arbitrators decision shall be final and binding on the STATE and the Parties. For the purpose of arbitration under this Article 6.6, the provisions of Articles 22.4 to 22.7 inclusive shall apply.
