purposes of adjusting the Emerald Assets Purchase Price or the Liberty Assets Purchase Price due to the existence of any title
matters under Article 4 or environmental matters under Article 5, (1) Emerald has allocated the Liberty Assets Purchase
Price among the Liberty Leases and Liberty Wells in the amounts set forth on Exhibit A-1 and Exhibit B-1,
as applicable; and (2) Liberty has allocated the Emerald Assets Purchase Price among the Emerald Leases and Emerald Wells in the
amounts set forth on Exhibit A-2 and Exhibit B-2, as applicable. The value allocated to each Emerald
Asset is the “Emerald Allocated Value,” and the value allocated to each Liberty Asset is the “Liberty
Allocated Value.”

 



    -11-
     
    

 

(b)          Emerald
and Liberty have agreed on the Allocated Values for the Assets, but neither Emerald nor Liberty otherwise makes any representation
or warranty as to the accuracy of such values.

 

(c)          Liberty
shall prepare an allocation of the Liberty Assets Purchase Price on a schedule (the “Proposed Liberty Section 1060
Allocation Schedule”) for purposes of, and in accordance with, Section 1060 of the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder within thirty (30) days after the Final Settlement Date. Emerald shall notify Liberty in writing of any objections to
the Proposed Liberty Section 1060 Allocation Schedule within fifteen (15) days of receipt thereof and if, within thirty (30) days
after delivery of notice of such objection, Emerald and Liberty cannot agree to a final allocation schedule to be used for income
Tax reporting purposes, Emerald and Liberty shall submit the Disputed matters to binding arbitration pursuant to Section 15.13
to finally determine the proper allocation of the Liberty Assets Purchase Price for purposes of Section 1060 of the Code, and shall
request that the arbitrator issue a final allocation schedule (the “Final Liberty Section 1060 Allocation
Schedule”) within thirty (30) days of the submission of the Dispute. Liberty and Emerald agree that the allocation
of the Liberty Assets Purchase Price as set forth on the Final Liberty Section 1060 Allocation Schedule shall be used by Liberty
and Emerald as the basis for reporting asset values and other items for purposes of all federal, state and local Tax Returns, including
without limitation Internal Revenue Service Form 8594. Liberty and Emerald further agree that each will take no position inconsistent
with such allocations on any applicable Tax Return, in any audit or proceeding before any Governmental Entity related to Taxes,
in any report made for Tax, financial accounting or any other purpose, or otherwise. In the event that the allocation described
herein is disputed by any Governmental Entity, the Party receiving notice of the dispute shall promptly notify the other Party
concerning resolution of the dispute.

 

(d)          Emerald
shall prepare an allocation of the Emerald Assets Purchase Price on a schedule (the “Proposed Emerald Section 1060
Allocation Schedule”) for purposes of, and in accordance with, Section 1060 of the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder within thirty (30) days after the Final Settlement Date. Liberty shall notify Emerald in writing of any objections to
the Proposed Emerald Section 1060 Allocation Schedule within fifteen (15) days of receipt thereof and if, within thirty (30) days
after delivery of notice of such objection, Liberty and Emerald cannot agree to a final allocation schedule to be used for income
Tax reporting purposes, Liberty and Emerald shall submit the Disputed matters to binding arbitration pursuant to Section 15.13
to finally determine the proper allocation of the Emerald Assets Purchase Price for purposes of Section 1060 of the Code, and shall
request that the arbitrator issue a final allocation schedule (the “Final Emerald Section 1060 Allocation
Schedule”) within thirty (30) days of the submission of the Dispute. Emerald and Liberty agree that the allocation
of the Emerald Assets Purchase Price as set forth on the Final Emerald Section 1060 Allocation Schedule shall be used by Emerald
and Liberty as the basis for reporting asset values and other items for purposes of all federal, state and local Tax Returns, including
without limitation Internal Revenue Service Form 8594. Emerald and Liberty further agree that each will take no position inconsistent
with such allocations on any applicable Tax Return, in any audit or proceeding before any Governmental Entity related to Taxes,
in any report made for Tax, financial accounting or any other purpose, or otherwise. In the event that the allocation described
herein is disputed by any Governmental Entity, the Party receiving notice of the dispute shall promptly notify the other Party
concerning resolution of the dispute.

2.5          Proration
of Costs and Revenues.

 

(a)          For
purposes of determining the amounts of the adjustments to the Liberty Assets Purchase Price and Emerald Assets Purchase Price provided
for in Section 2.4, the principles set forth in this Section 2.5(a) shall apply. Transferee shall be entitled to
all production of Hydrocarbons from or attributable to the Leases, Lands, and Wells relating to those Assets of the Transferor
at and after the Effective Time (and all products and proceeds attributable thereto), and to all other income, proceeds, receipts
and credits earned with respect to such Assets at or after the Effective Time, and shall be responsible for (and entitled to any
refunds with respect to) all Property Expenses relating to those Assets of the Transferor incurred at and after the Effective Time.
Transferor shall be entitled to all Hydrocarbon production from or attributable to Leases, Lands, and Wells relating to those Assets
of the Transferee prior to the Effective Time (and all products and proceeds attributable thereto), and to all other income, proceeds,
receipts and credits earned with respect to such Assets prior to the Effective Time, and shall be responsible for (and entitled
to any refunds with respect to) all Property Expenses relating to those Assets of the Transferor incurred prior to the Effective
Time. “Earned” and “incurred”, as used in the Agreement shall be interpreted
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and Council of Petroleum Accountants Society standards, and expenditures
that are incurred pursuant to an operating agreement, unit agreement or similar agreement shall be deemed incurred when expended
by the operator of the applicable Lease, Land or Well, in accordance with the applicable Transferor’s then current practice.
For purposes of allocating production (and accounts receivable with respect thereto), under this Section 2.5(a), (i) liquid
Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be “from or attributable to” the Leases, Lands, and Wells when they pass
through the inlet flange of the pipeline connecting into the storage facilities into which they are run or, if there are no such
storage facilities, when they pass through the LACT meters or similar meters at the initial point of entry into the pipelines through
which they are transported from the field, and (ii) gaseous Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be “from or attributable
to” the Leases, Lands, and Wells when they pass through the royalty measurement meters, delivery point sales meters
or custody transfer meters on the gathering lines or pipelines through which they are transported (whichever meter is closest to
the well). Transferor shall utilize reasonable interpolative procedures, consistent with industry practice, to arrive at an allocation
of production when exact meter readings or gauging and strapping data are not available.

 

(b)          Should
Transferee receive after Closing any proceeds, income or other amounts to which Transferor is entitled under Section 2.5(a),
Transferee shall fully disclose, account for and promptly remit the same to Transferor. If, after Closing, Transferor receives
any proceeds, income or other amounts to which Transferor is not entitled pursuant to Section 2.5(a), Transferor shall fully
disclose, account for, and promptly remit the same to Transferee.

 

(c)          Should
Transferee pay after Closing any Property Expenses for which Transferor is responsible under Section 2.5(a), Transferor
shall reimburse Transferee promptly after receipt of an invoice with respect to such Property Expenses, accompanied by copies of
the relevant vendor or other invoice and proof of payment. Should Transferor pay after Closing any Property Expenses for which
Transferor is not responsible under Section 2.5(a), Transferee shall reimburse Transferor promptly after receipt of an invoice
with respect to such Property Expenses, accompanied by copies of relevant vendor or other invoice and proof of payment.

 



    -15-
     
    

 

(d)          After
Closing, Transferee shall handle all joint interest audits and other audits of Property Expenses covering the period for which
Transferor is in whole or in part responsible under Section 2.5(a), provided that Transferee shall not agree to any adjustments
to previously assessed costs for which Transferor is liable without the prior written consent of Transferor. Transferee shall provide
Transferor with a copy of all applicable audit reports and written audit agreements received by Transferee and relating to periods
for which Transferor is wholly or partially responsible.

 

2.6           Escrow
Amount. The Escrow Amount, from time to time, together with the interest earned thereon, shall be deposited and held in an
escrow account and paid out by an “Escrow Agent” in accordance with the provisions of this Section
2.6 and an escrow agreement to be agreed upon by the Parties (the “Escrow Agreement”) if such Escrow
Agreement is necessary under Articles 4 or 5 upon final resolution of any Title Disputed Matters or any Environmental
Disputed Matters in accordance with Articles 4 and 5, respectively, and which Escrow Agreement will require the
joint written instruction of the Parties to the Escrow Agreement for any distributions. The full amount of any Escrow Amount held
under the Escrow Agreement shall be released upon final resolution of the Title Disputed Matter or any Environmental Disputed
Matter underlying such Escrow Amount in accordance with Articles 4 and 5, respectively.

Due
Diligence Review

 

3.1           Due
Diligence Review. Each of Liberty and Emerald will make their respective Records and Assets available to the other Party and
its Representatives for inspection and review, at Transferee’s sole cost, to permit Transferee to perform its due diligence
(“Due Diligence Review”) pursuant to the terms and conditions of Sections 3.2 and 3.3,
respectively. The notices pertaining to the Due Diligence Review for the Notice of Defective Interest (as defined in Section
4.2(b)) and the Environmental Defect Notice (as defined in Section 5.2) must be received by Transferor no later than
5:00 p.m. Mountain Time on August 22, 2014 (the “Defect Notice Date”). Each of Liberty and Emerald shall
be entitled to conduct its Due Diligence Review until the Defect Notice Date (such period from the Effective Date through the
Defect Notice Date, the “Due Diligence Period”).

 

3.2           Access
to Transferor Records. Upon reasonable advance notice, the Transferor will make the Transferor Records available to Transferee
at the offices of Transferor during Transferor’s normal business hours to the extent the Transferor Records can be provided
without unreasonable effort or expense and are not subject to non-disclosure or confidentiality obligations to a third party,
so Transferee and its Representatives may conduct, during the Due Diligence Period, at Transferee’s sole risk and expense,
on-site inspections of all or any portion of the Transferor Records.

3.3         Access
to the Transferor Assets.

 

(a)          Access.

 

(1)         To
the extent that Transferor may do so as an operator or non-operator of Transferor Assets, Transferor will grant Transferee and
its Representatives access to the Transferor Assets upon reasonable prior notice during Transferor’s normal business hours,
so Transferee and its Representatives may conduct, during the Due Diligence Period, at Transferee’s sole risk and expense,
on-site inspections and an ASTM Phase I environmental review of all or any portion of the Transferor Assets (each, an “Environmental
Assessment”). Transferee shall not conduct an ASTM Phase II environmental assessment or any physical sampling, boring,
drilling, or other invasive investigation activities without the prior notice and consent of Transferor, which consent Transferor
may withhold in its sole and absolute discretion.

 

(2)         
If Transferee or its agents prepares an Environmental Assessment of any Transferor Asset, Transferee agrees to keep such assessment
confidential and to furnish final copies thereof to Transferor only upon request; provided, however, that to the extent
Transferee reasonably believes based on the advice of legal counsel that disclosure to a Governmental Entity is required for any
matter identified by an Environmental Assessment in order for Transferee to comply with Environmental Laws, Transferee may after
prior written notice to Transferor containing a brief analysis of why such Transferee disclosure is required by the Environmental
Laws, disclose such matter to the Governmental Entity to which notice is required. In connection with any on-site inspections,
if any, prior to Closing, Transferee (1) agrees not to interfere with, and will cause its Representatives not to interfere with,
the normal operation of the Transferor Assets, (2) agrees to comply with, and will cause its Representatives to comply with, all
requirements of the operators of the Transferor Assets (to the extent such requirements are disclosed to Transferee prior to such
on-site inspections) and (3) agrees to maintain adequate insurance and to confirm to Transferor that it and its Representatives
are adequately insured.

 

(b)        Indemnity.
Except to the extent caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any member of the Transferor Indemnified Parties,
Transferee waives, releases and agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Transferor Indemnified Parties from and against
any and all losses arising out of, resulting from, or relating to the access afforded to Transferee and its Representatives under
this Agreement or the activities of Transferee and its Representatives related to such access or any Environmental Assessment;
even if such Losses arise out of or result from the active, passive, concurrent, or comparative
negligence, strict liability, or other fault or violation of Law of or by a member of the Transferor Indemnified Parties;
provided, however, that such indemnity shall not extend to Remediation Costs required as a result of disclosure to a Governmental
Entity pursuant to Section 3.3(a)(2).

 



    -17-
     
    

 

(c)        Clean-Up.
As soon as is reasonably practicable following completion of Transferee’s due diligence, Transferee shall, at its sole cost
and expense and without any cost or expense to the Transferor Indemnified Parties (1) repair all damage done to the Transferor
Assets in connection with any Environmental Assessment, (2) restore the Transferor Assets to the approximate same or better condition
in existence prior to commencement of any Environmental Assessment, and (3) remove all equipment, tools or other property brought
onto the Transferor Assets in connection with any Environmental Assessment.

TITLE
MATTERS

 

4.1         Transferor’s
Title.

 

(a)       Defensible
Title. The term “Defensible Title” means such ownership of record to the Transferor Leases and Transferor
Wells that is deducible from the applicable county, state and federal records such that a reasonably prudent person engaged in
the business of the ownership, development and operation of oil and gas leaseholds and properties and having knowledge of all of
the facts and their legal bearing would be willing to accept the same, and that, subject to and except for Permitted Encumbrances
as defined in Section 4.1(b):

 

(1)         entitles
Transferor to receive a share of the Hydrocarbons produced, saved and marketed from any Transferor Lease or Transferor Well throughout
the duration of the productive life of such Transferor Lease or Transferor Well, only insofar as to the specified formation(s)
shown on Exhibit A-1, Exhibit A-2, Exhibit B-1, or Exhibit B-2 for such
Transferor Lease or Transferor Well, as applicable, and if there are no such specified formation(s), then as to all formations,
after satisfaction of all royalties, overriding royalties, nonparticipating royalties, net profits interests or other similar burdens
on or measured by production of Hydrocarbons (a “Net Revenue Interest”), of not less than the Net Revenue
Interest share shown in Exhibit A-1 or Exhibit A-2, as applicable for such Transferor, for such Transferor
Lease (on an 8/8ths basis), or Exhibit B-1 or Exhibit B-2, as applicable for such Transferor, for such
Transferor Well;

 

(2)         obligates
Transferor to bear a percentage of the costs and expenses for the maintenance, development, operation and the production relating
to any Transferor Well throughout the productive life of such Transferor Well (“Working Interest”) not
greater than the Working Interest shown in Exhibit B-1 or Exhibit B-2, as applicable for such Transferor,
from the currently producing formations for such Transferor Well, without increase, except increases to the extent that they are
accompanied by a proportionate increase in Transferor’s Net Revenue Interest;

 

(3)         enables
such Transferor Lease to cover the Net Acre interest set forth in Exhibit A-1 or Exhibit A-2, as applicable
for such Transferor, only insofar as to the specified formation(s) shown on Exhibit A-1 or Exhibit A-2
for such Transferor Lease, as applicable, and if there are no such specified formation(s), then as to all formations for such Transferor
Lease; and

 



    -18-
     
    

 

(4)         is
free and clear of Liens.

 

(b)          Permitted
Encumbrances. The term “Permitted Encumbrances” shall mean:

 

(1)         lessors’
royalties, overriding royalties, net profits interests, production payments, reversionary interests and similar burdens if the
net cumulative effect of such burdens does not operate to reduce the Net Revenue Interests below those set forth in Exhibit
A-1 or Exhibit A-2, as applicable for such Transferor, for such Transferor Lease, or Exhibit B-1
or Exhibit B-2, as applicable for such Transferor, for such Transferor Well, only insofar as to the specified formation(s)
shown on Exhibit A-1, Exhibit A-2, Exhibit B-1, or Exhibit B-2 for such
Transferor Lease or Transferor Well, as applicable, and if there are no such specified formation(s), then as to all formations;

 

(2)         statutory
Liens for taxes that are not yet due and payable or that are being contested in good faith in the normal course of business;

 

(3)         all
rights to consent by, required notices to, filings with, or other actions by Governmental Entities, in connection with the conveyance
of the applicable Transferor Asset if the same are customarily sought after such conveyance;

of reassignment contained in any Transferor Leases, or assignments thereof, providing for reassignment upon the surrender or expiration
of any Transferor Leases;

 

(5)         easements,
rights of way, servitudes, permits, surface leases and other rights with respect to surface operations, pipelines, grazing, logging,
canals, ditches, reservoirs or the like, and easements for streets, alleys, highways, pipelines, telephone lines, power lines,
railways and other easements and rights-of-way, on, over or in respect of any of the Transferor Assets or any restriction on access
thereto that do not materially interfere with the operation of the affected Transferor Asset;

 

(6)         the
terms and conditions of the Transferor Contracts listed in Exhibit C-1 or Exhibit C-2, as applicable
for each Transferor, or any compulsory pooling order of the North Dakota Industrial Commission; provided, however, that
the effect of any such items do not cause (i) the Net Revenue Interest to be less than as set forth in Exhibit A-1,
Exhibit A-2, Exhibit B-1, or Exhibit B-2 respectively, only insofar as to the specified
formation(s) shown on Exhibit A-1, Exhibit A-2, Exhibit B-1, or Exhibit B-2,
as applicable, and if there are no such specified formation(s), then as to all formations, for the applicable Transferor Asset,
or (ii) the Working Interest to be more than as set forth in in Exhibit B-1 or Exhibit B-2, as
applicable, from the currently producing formations;

 

(7)         materialmen’s,
mechanics’, operators’ or other similar Liens arising in the ordinary course of business (i) if such Liens have not
been filed pursuant to Law and the time for filing such Liens has expired, (ii) if filed, such Liens have not yet become due and
payable or payment is being withheld as provided by Law, or (iii) if their validity is being contested in good faith by appropriate
action;

 



    -19-
     
    

 

(8)         such
Title Defects as Transferee has waived;

 

(9)         any
Liens or encumbrances burdening the Transferor Assets which will be released at or before Closing;

 

(10)        any
defects, irregularities or deficiencies in title to easements, rights-of-way or surface use agreements that do not materially adversely
affect the value of any Transferor Asset; and

 

(11)        all
other Liens, contracts, agreements, instruments, obligations, defects and irregularities affecting the Transferor Assets that do
not (or would not upon foreclosure or other enforcement) reduce the Net Revenue Interest set forth in Exhibit A-1,
Exhibit A-2, Exhibit B-1, or Exhibit B-2 respectively, only insofar as to the specified
formation(s) shown on Exhibit A-1, Exhibit A-2, Exhibit B-1, or Exhibit B-2,
as applicable, and if there are no such specified formation(s), then as to all formations, nor prevent the receipt of proceeds
of production therefrom, nor increase the share of costs above the Working Interest set forth in Exhibit B-1 or Exhibit
B-2 respectively, from the currently producing formations, nor materially adversely interfere with or detract from the
ownership, operation, value or use of the Transferor Assets.

 

4.2         Purchase
Price Adjustment Procedures.

 

(a)          Title
Defect. The term “Title Defect” means any Lien, obligation (including contract obligation), defect,
or other matter (including without limitation a discrepancy in Net Revenue Interest or Working Interest) that causes the Transferor
not to have Defensible Title to any Transferor Lease or Transferor Well. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following shall not
be considered Title Defects:

 

(1)         defects
based solely on lack of information in connection with documents filed of record not contained in Transferor’s files;

 

(2)         defects
in the chain of title consisting of the mere failure to recite marital status in a document or omissions of successions of heirship
or estate proceedings, unless Transferee provides clear and convincing evidence that such failure or omission has resulted in another
Person’s actual and superior claim of title to the relevant Transferor Asset;

 

(3)         defects
arising out of lack of corporate or other entity authorization unless Transferee provides affirmative evidence that such corporate
or other entity action was not authorized and results in another Person’s actual and superior claim of title to the relevant
Transferor Asset;

 

(4)         defects
arising out of lack of survey, unless a survey is expressly required by applicable Laws;

 




    -20-
     
    

 

(5)         Liens
created under deeds of trust, mortgages and similar instruments by the lessor under a Transferor Lease covering the lessor’s
surface and mineral interests in the land covered thereby which would customarily be accepted in taking oil and gas leases or purchasing
undeveloped oil and gas leases and for which the lessee would customarily seek a subordination of such Lien to the oil and gas
leasehold estate prior to conducting drilling activities on the Transferor Lease;

 

(6)         defects
based on failure to record a Transferor Lease issued by the Bureau of Land Management or the North Dakota Board of University and
School Lands, or any assignments of record title or operating rights in such Transferor Leases, in the real property, conveyance
or other records of the county in which such Transferor Lease is located; and

 

(7)         defects
that have been cured by applicable Laws of limitations, prescription or otherwise.

 

(b)          Notice
of Defective Interest. On or before the Defect Notice Date, Transferee may formally advise Transferor in writing of any matters
that in Transferee’s reasonable opinion constitute a Title Defect with respect to Transferor’s title to all or any
portion of the Transferor Leases and Transferor Wells (“Notice of Defective Interests”). The Notice of
Defective Interests shall be in writing and contain the following: (1) a clear, complete and accurate description of the alleged
Title Defect(s), (2) the Transferor Leases or Transferor Wells (and the applicable zone(s) therein) affected by the alleged Title
Defect(s) (each a “Title Defect Property”), (3) the Transferor Allocated Value of each Transferor Lease
or Transferor Well subject to the alleged Title Defect(s), (4) supporting documents reasonably necessary for Transferor (as well
as any title attorney or examiner hired by Transferor) to verify the existence of the alleged Title Defect(s), and (5) the amount
by which Transferee reasonably believes the Transferor Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property is reduced by the alleged
Title Defect(s) and the computations and information upon which Transferee’s belief is based. To give Transferor an opportunity
to commence reviewing and curing Title Defects, Transferee agrees to give Transferor written notice of all Title Defects discovered
by Transferee at the end of each calendar week during the Due Diligence Period; provided, however, any such written notice
may be preliminary in nature and supplemented prior to the Defect Notice Date. Any matters that may otherwise constitute a Title
Defect, but of which Transferor has not been notified by Transferee in accordance with this Section 4.2(b) prior to the
Defect Notice Date, shall be deemed to have been waived by Transferee.

 

(c)          Remedies
for Title Defects. Subject to (x) Transferor’s continuing right to title Dispute resolution under Section 4.3,
(y) the Individual Title Threshold and (z) the Aggregate Title Deductible, in the event that any Title Defect timely asserted by
Transferee in accordance with Section 4.2(b) actually exists and is not waived by Transferee or cured on or before Closing,
the Transferor shall, with the prior written consent of Transferee, take one of the following options with respect to such Title
Defect prior to Closing:

 




    -21-
     
    

 

(1)         Transferor
may convey the Title Defect Property to Transferee at Closing and reduce the Transferor Purchase Price by the Title Defect Amount
and retain the right to cure the Title Defect after Closing;

 

(2)         Transferor
may exclude the Title Defect Property from the transaction and reduce the Transferor Purchase Price by an amount equal to the Transferor
Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property; or

 

(3)         Transferor
may convey the Title Defect Property to Transferee at Closing, make no adjustment to the Transferor Purchase Price, and indemnify
Transferee against all Losses resulting from such Title Defect, pursuant to the terms and conditions of an indemnification agreement
to be agreed to between the Parties.

 

In the event that the Transferor
elects one of the remedies set forth in this Section 4.2(c) as of the Closing but the Transferee does not consent on
or before Closing to such election, then the Parties will be deemed to have elected the remedy in Section 4.2(c)(2).

 

(d)          Title
Defect Amount. The “Title Defect Amount” means the amount by which the Transferor Allocated Value
of the Title Defect Property affected by such Title Defect is reduced as a result of the existence of such Title Defect and shall
be determined in accordance with the following methodology, terms and conditions:

 

(1)         if
Transferee and Transferor agree on the Title Defect Amount, that amount shall be the Title Defect Amount;

 

(2)         if
the Title Defect is a Lien that is undisputed and liquidated in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the amount of the
payment necessary to remove such Title Defect from the Title Defect Property; and

 

(3)         if
the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden or charge upon or other defect in title to the Title Defect Property
of a type not described in subsections (1) or (2) above, the Title Defect Amount shall be determined by taking into account the
following factors: (i) any discrepancy between (A) the Net Revenue Interest or Working Interest for any Title Defect Property and
(B) the Net Revenue Interest or Working Interest stated in Exhibit A-1, Exhibit A-2, Exhibit
B-1, or Exhibit B-2, respectively; (ii) the Transferor Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property; (iii)
the portion of the Title Defect Property affected by the Title Defect; (iv) the legal effect of the Title Defect; (v) the values
placed upon the Title Defect by Transferee and Transferor; (vi) any discrepancy between (A) the Net Acre interest covered by a
Transferor Lease and (B) the Net Acre interest covered by such Transferor Lease stated in Exhibit A-1 or Exhibit
A-2; and (vii) such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation.

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, the aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title Defects upon any Title Defect Property
shall not exceed the Transferor Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property.

(e)          Title
Threshold and Deductible. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (1) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Transferor
Purchase Price or other remedies provided by (i) Transferor for any individual Title Defect, or (ii) Transferee for any
individual Title Benefit for which the Title Defect Amount or Title Benefit Amount, as applicable, does not exceed $50,000 (“Individual
Title Threshold”); and (2) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Transferor Purchase Price or other remedies
provided by (i) Transferor for any Title Defect that exceeds the Individual Title Threshold or (ii) Transferee for any
individual Title Benefit unless the Title Defect Amounts of all such Title Defects or Title Benefit Amounts of all such Title Benefits,
in the aggregate, excluding any Title Defects cured by Transferor (with respect to Title Defects), exceeds a deductible in an amount
equal to 2.5% of the Transferor Purchase Price (the “Aggregate Title Deductible”), after which point
Transferor or Transferee shall be entitled to adjustments to the Transferor Purchase Price or other remedies only with respect
to such Title Defects or Title Benefits, as applicable, in excess of such Aggregate Title Deductible.  

 

(f)          Transferor’s
Right to Cure. 

 

(1)         Transferor
shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at its sole cost, to cure or remove at any time prior to Closing any
Title Defects of which it has been advised by Transferee.

 

(2)         Subject
to the provisions of this Article 4, if there is a reduction in the Transferor Purchase Price pursuant to Section 4.2(c),
then Transferor shall retain the right but not the obligation for 180 days after the Closing Date to attempt to cure any such Title
Defects at Transferor’s sole cost. If Transferor cures any such Title Defect to Transferee’s reasonable satisfaction,
then Transferee shall promptly pay Transferor the Title Defect Amount with respect to the Title Defect that is so cured.

 

(g)          Title
Benefits. The term “Title Benefit” means any right, circumstance, or condition that operates to increase:

 

(1)         the
Transferor’s Net Revenue Interest in any Transferor Lease or Transferor Well throughout the duration of the productive life
of such Transferor Lease or Transferor Well, only insofar as to the specified formation(s) shown on Exhibit A-1,
Exhibit A-2, Exhibit B-1, or Exhibit B-2 for such Transferor Lease or Transferor Well,
as applicable, and if there are no such specified formation(s), then as to all formations, above the Net Revenue Interest share
shown in Exhibit A-1 or Exhibit A-2, as applicable for such Transferor, for such Transferor Lease (on
an 8/8ths basis), or Exhibit B-1 or Exhibit B-2, as applicable for such Transferor, for such Transferor
Well, to the extent the same does not cause a greater than proportionate increase in Transferor’s Working Interest; or

 

(2)         the
Transferor’s Net Acres in each such Transferor Lease above the Net Acres set forth in Exhibit A-1 or Exhibit
A-2, as applicable for such Transferor, only insofar as to the specified formation(s) shown on Exhibit A-1
or Exhibit A-2 for such Transferor Lease, as applicable, and if there are no such specified formation(s), then as
to all formations for such Transferor Lease.

 




    -23-
     
    

 

(h)          Title
Benefit Notice. If Transferor or Transferee discovers any Title Benefit, then such Party may (but shall have no obligation
to, other than with respect to any Title Benefit discovered by Transferee, with respect to which Transferee shall be obligated
to) deliver to the other Party, prior to the Defect Notice Date, a notice with respect to such Title Benefit. The notice must be
in writing and be asserted in good faith and include (1) a description of the Title Benefit, (2) the Transferor Leases
and/or Transferor Wells affected by the Title Benefit, (3) the Transferor Allocated Values of the Transferor Leases and/or
Transferor Wells subject to such Title Benefit, and (4) the amount by which Transferor or Transferee, as applicable, reasonably
believes the Transferor Allocated Value of those Transferor Leases and/or Transferor Wells is increased by the Title Benefit, and
the computations and information upon which such Party’s belief is based.

 

(i)          Title
Benefit Amount. The amount by which the Transferor Allocated Value of any Transferor Lease or Transferor Well is increased
as a result of the existence of a Title Benefit with respect thereto is the “Title Benefit Amount.” The
Title Benefit Amount shall be determined in accordance with the same methodology, terms, and conditions for determining the Title
Defect Amount.

 

4.3           Title
Dispute Resolution. The Parties shall resolve Disputes concerning the following matters pursuant to this Section 4.3:
(a) the existence and scope of a Title Defect, Title Benefit, Title Defect Amount, or Title Benefit Amount, (b) the Title Defect
Amount or Title Benefit Amount of that portion of the Transferor Asset affected by a Title Defect or Title Benefit, respectively,
and (c) the adequacy of Transferor’s Title Defect curative materials and Transferee’s reasonable satisfaction thereof
(the “Title Disputed Matters”). The Parties agree to attempt to initially resolve all Disputes through
good faith negotiations. If the Parties cannot resolve the Title Disputed Matters on or before Closing, then (y) with respect
to all Title Defects subject to a Title Disputed Matter, the Transferor Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value
of the affected Transferor Asset and the Title Defect Property shall not be conveyed at Closing, and (z) with respect to all Title
Benefits subject to a Title Disputed Matter, the Transferor Purchase Price shall not be adjusted at Closing but the Title Defect
Property shall be conveyed at Closing, and, at Closing, Transferee shall pay the Title Escrow Amount to the Escrow Agent to be
held as part of the Escrow Amount. The term “Title Escrow Amount” means (I) with respect to all Title
Defects subject to a Title Disputed Matter, the Allocated Value of the affected Transferor Asset, and (II) with respect to all
Title Benefits subject to a Title Disputed Matter, the Title Benefit Amount associated with such Title Benefit. Further, the Title
Disputed Matters will be finally determined by binding arbitration before an independent arbitrator appointed by the Parties,
who shall be an oil and gas title attorney licensed in North Dakota with a minimum of 10 years’ experience with title issues
affecting the types of properties which are the subject of the Title Disputed Matters. The arbitrator shall employ such independent
attorneys, petroleum engineers and/or other consultants as deemed necessary. On or before thirty (30) days after Closing, Transferee
and Transferor shall present their respective positions in writing to the arbitrator, together with such evidence as each Party
deems appropriate. The arbitrator shall be instructed to resolve the Dispute through a final decision within twenty (20) days
after submission of the matters in Dispute and the final decision may be reflected in the Final Settlement Statement. Upon final
resolution of any Title Disputed Matters with respect to any Title Defects that are subject to such Title Disputed Matters, the
Parties shall make the election of remedies under Section 4.2(c) and take such further actions as are necessary to
carry out such election including executing the Liberty Assignment or Emerald Assignment, as applicable, and delivering joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent directing the distribution of the Title Escrow Amount. Upon final resolution of any Title
Disputed Matters with respect to any Title Benefits that are subject to such Title Disputed Matters, the Parties shall take such
further actions as are necessary to carry out the arbitrator’s decision including executing the Liberty Assignment or Emerald
Assignment, as applicable, and delivering joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent directing the distribution of the Title
Escrow Amount. All of Transferor’s covenants under Article 8 will apply to the Title Defect Property until such time
as the Parties have taken such actions as are required based on the arbitrator’s decision.

4.4           Preferential
Rights and Consents Except for Permitted Encumbrances, all preferential rights to purchase and consents to assign relating
to the Assets are listed on Schedule 4.4.  The remedies set forth in this Section 4.4 are the
exclusive remedies under this Agreement for consents to assign and preferential rights to purchase that are disclosed on Schedule 4.4
or are discovered prior to Closing. A Transferor Asset affected by a Material Consent or preferential right to purchase
that is outstanding at Closing shall be referred to as an “Affected Asset”.

 

(a)          Consents.
Promptly after the date hereof, Transferor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to send notices to those Persons necessary
to request all consents to assignment of the Assets. If prior to Closing, Transferor fails to obtain a consent to assign that would
invalidate the conveyance of the Asset affected by the consent to assign or materially affect the value or use of the Asset (a
“Material Consent”) and the failure to obtain such Material Consent has not been waived by Transferee,
then Transferor shall retain the Affected Asset and the Transferor Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Transferor Allocated
Value of the Affected Asset. If such Material Consent has been obtained as of the Final Settlement Date, Transferor shall convey
the Affected Asset to Transferee effective as of the Effective Time and Transferee shall pay Transferor the Transferor Allocated
Value of the Affected Asset in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If such Material Consent has not been
obtained as of the Final Settlement Date, the Affected Asset shall be permanently excluded from the sale and the Transferor Purchase
Price shall be deemed to be permanently reduced by an amount equal to the Transferor Allocated Value of the Affected Asset. Transferee
shall reasonably cooperate with Transferor in obtaining any Material Consent, including providing assurances of reasonable financial
conditions, but Transferee shall not be required to expend funds or make any other type of financial commitments as a condition
of obtaining such Material Consent.

 




    -25-
     
    

 

(b)          Preferential
Purchase Rights.  Transferor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to give notices required in connection with preferential
purchase rights prior to Closing.  If any preferential right to purchase any portion of the Assets is exercised prior to the
Closing Date, then the Affected Assets shall be excluded from the sale and the Transferor Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward
by an amount equal to the Transferor Allocated Value of such Affected Assets.  If by Closing, either (1) the time frame for
the exercise of a preferential purchase right has not expired and Transferor has not received notice of an intent not to exercise
or a waiver of the preferential purchase right, or (2) a third Person exercises its preferential right to purchase, but the time
frame for consummation of the preferential purchase right has not expired prior to the Closing, then Transferor shall retain the
Affected Assets and the Transferor Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by an amount equal to the Transferor Allocated Value
of such Affected Assets.  As to any Affected Assets retained by Transferor hereunder, following Closing if a preferential
right to purchase is not consummated by the Final Settlement Date, then the Affected Asset shall be permanently excluded from the
sale, and the Transferor Purchase Price shall be deemed to be permanently reduced by an amount equal to the Transferor Allocated
Value of the Affected Asset, provided, however, that with respect to any Affected Assets retained by Transferor hereunder,
if a preferential right to purchase is not consummated within the time frame specified in the preferential purchase right following
Closing and before the Final Settlement Date, or if the time frame for exercise of the preferential purchase right expires without
exercise after the Closing and before the Final Settlement Date, then Transferor shall promptly convey the Affected Assets to Transferee,
effective as of the Effective Time, and Transferee shall pay the Transferor Allocated Value thereof pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement.

 

ARTICLE
5

ENVIRONMENtAL MATTERS

 

5.1           Exclusive
Remedy. This Article V shall be the exclusive right and remedy of Transferor with respect to the existence of any Condition
or Transferee’s failure to comply with Environmental Laws with respect to the Transferor Assets.

 

5.2           Environmental
Defect Notice. On or before the Defect Notice Date, Transferee may formally advise Transferor in writing of any matters that
in Transferee’s reasonable opinion constitute an Environmental Defect (“Environmental Defect Notice”).
The Environmental Defect Notice shall be in writing and contain the following: (a) a clear, complete and accurate description
of the alleged Environmental Defect(s), (b) the Transferor Assets affected by the alleged Environmental Defect(s) (each an “Environmental
Defect Property”), (c) the Transferor Allocated Value of each Environmental Defect Property, (d) supporting documents
reasonably necessary for Transferor (as well as any consultant hired by Transferor) to verify the existence of the alleged Environmental
Defect(s), and (e) an estimate of Remediation Costs and the amount by which Transferee reasonably believes the Transferor Allocated
Value of each Environmental Defect Property is reduced by the alleged Environmental Defect(s) and the computations and information
upon which Transferee’s belief is based.

 

5.3           Remedies
for Environmental Defects. Subject to (x) Transferor’s continuing right to environmental Dispute resolution under Section
5.5, (y) the Individual Environmental Threshold as defined in Section 5.4 and (z) the Aggregate Environmental Deductible
as defined in Section 5.4, in the event that any Environmental Defect timely asserted by Transferee in accordance with
Section 5.2 actually exists and is not waived by Transferee or cured on or before Closing, the Transferor shall, with the
prior written consent of Transferee, take one of the following options with respect to such Environmental Defect prior to Closing:

 




    -26-
     
    

 

(a)          Transferor
may convey the Environmental Defect Property to Transferee at Closing and reduce the Transferor Purchase Price by the Remediation
Costs of the Environmental Defect Property;

 

(b)          Transferor
may exclude the Environmental Defect Property from the transaction and reduce the Transferor Purchase Price by an amount equal
to the Transferor Allocated Value of the Environmental Defect Property; or

 

(c)          Transferor
may convey the Environmental Defect Property to Transferee at Closing, make no adjustment to the Transferor Purchase Price, and
indemnify Transferee against all Losses resulting from such Environmental Defect, pursuant to the terms and conditions of an indemnification
agreement to be agreed to between the Parties.

 

In the event that the Transferor elects
one of the remedies set forth in this Section 5.3 as of the Closing but the Transferee does not consent on or before
Closing to such election, then the Parties will be deemed to have elected the remedy in Section 5.3(b).

 

5.4           Environmental
Threshold; Deductible. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (a) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Transferor
Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Transferor for any individual Environmental Defect for which the Remediation Costs
does not exceed $50,000 (“Individual Environmental Threshold”); and (b) in no event shall there be any
adjustments to the Transferor Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Transferor for any Environmental Defect that exceeds
the Individual Environmental Threshold unless the Remediation Costs of all Environmental Defects, in the aggregate, excluding
any Environmental Defects cured by Transferor, exceed a deductible in an amount equal to 2.5% of the Transferor Purchase Price
(the “Aggregate Environmental Deductible”), after which point Transferee shall be entitled to adjustments
to the Transferor Purchase Price or other remedies only with respect to such Remediation Costs in excess of such Aggregate Environmental
Deductible.

 

5.5           Environmental
Dispute Resolution. The Parties shall resolve Disputes concerning the following matters pursuant to this Section
5.5: (a) the existence and scope of an Environmental Defect or the Remediation Costs, (b) the Remediation Costs of that portion
of the Transferor Asset affected by an Environmental Defect and (c) the adequacy of Transferor’s cure of an Environmental
Defect and Transferee’s reasonable satisfaction thereof (the “Environmental Disputed Matters”).
The Parties agree to attempt to initially resolve all Disputes through good faith negotiations. If the Parties cannot resolve
the Environmental Disputed Matters on or before Closing, then the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such
Environmental Defect Property (such amount, the “Environmental Escrow Amount”), such Environmental Defect
Property shall not be conveyed at Closing, and, at Closing, Transferee shall pay such Environmental Escrow Amount to the Escrow
Agent as part of the Escrow Amount. The Environmental Disputed Matters will be finally determined by binding arbitration before
an independent arbitrator appointed by the Parties, provided that the independent arbitrator shall be qualified by education,
knowledge of, and experience with environmental defects affecting the types of properties which are subject to or relate to the
disputed Environmental Defect or Environmental Disputed Matters. The arbitrator shall employ such independent attorneys and/or
other consultants as the arbitrator deems necessary, with the costs of such employment to be shared equally by the Transferor
and Transferee. On or before thirty (30) days after Closing, Transferor and Transferee shall present their respective positions
in writing to the arbitrator, together with such evidence as each Party deems appropriate. The arbitrator shall be instructed
to resolve the Dispute through a final decision within twenty (20) days after submission of the matters in dispute, and the final
decision may be reflected in the Final Settlement Statement. Upon final resolution of any Environmental Disputed Matters with
respect to any Environmental Defects that are subject to such Environmental Disputed Matters, the Parties shall make the election
of remedies under Section 5.3 and take such further actions as are necessary to carry out such election including
executing the Liberty Assignment or Emerald Assignment, as applicable, and delivering joint written instructions to the Escrow
Agent directing the distribution of the Environmental Escrow Amount. All of Transferor’s covenants under Article 8
will apply to the Environmental Defect Property until such time as the Parties have taken such actions as are required based on
the arbitrator’s decision.

5.6         Transfer
of Burgundy Wellbore Interests.

 

(a)          Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, Emerald shall retain ownership, and shall not convey the Ron Burgundy 3-23-14H well identified
on Exhibit A-1 together with (1) all associated facilities and equipment and (2) the applicable Leases
in the unit for such well only insofar as such Leases cover the wellbore of such Well (such assets, properties, and wellbore interest
in the Leases are, collectively, the “Burgundy Wellbore Interests”) to Liberty, and the Liberty Assumed
Obligations shall not include any Obligations arising from or related to the Burgundy Wellbore Interests (the “Burgundy
Liabilities”), unless and until the conditions set forth in this Section 5.6 are satisfied.

 

(b)          On
or prior to the Final Settlement Date, Emerald shall take all action necessary and appropriate to Remediate the Burgundy Wellbore
Interests to the extent required to comply with Environmental Laws and industry standards generally followed in the upstream oil
extraction business in the Bakken formation. Emerald shall manage, supervise and administer the Remediation in accordance with
industry standards generally followed in the upstream oil extraction business in the Bakken formation, and applicable Environmental
Laws, including applicable regulations of the North Dakota Industrial Commission (“NDIC”), and
Emerald shall provide Liberty prompt advance notice of the status, and intended plan, of the Remediation, and shall provide
Liberty prompt notice of any notice from or discussions with the NDIC or any other Governmental Entity concerning the Remediation.

 

(c)          On
or prior to the Final Settlement Date, Emerald shall obtain, at its sole cost and expense, a comprehensive waiver, release and
settlement of claims in a form satisfactory to Liberty in its reasonable discretion, from each Person that owns surface rights
on or adjacent to the Burgundy Wellbore Interests (each, a “Landowner Release”).

 

(d)          All
expenses related to, arising from or incurred in connection with the Remediation or the Landowner Releases (collectively, the “Burgundy
Remediation Costs”) shall be borne Emerald. Liberty shall not be required to pay or incur any cost or make any other
type of financial or operational commitment in connection with the obligations of Emerald under this Section 5.6.

 




    -28-
     
    

 

(e)          If
the Remediation is completed and the Landowner Releases are delivered on or prior to the Final Settlement Date, in each case, to
the satisfaction of Liberty in its reasonable discretion (provided that Liberty shall not be permitted to assert it is dissatisfied
with the completion of the Remediation if Liberty has received verbal or written notice from the NDIC and the North Dakota Department
of Health, to the extent each such agency asserts jurisdiction over the Remediation, that the Burgundy Well is in compliance with
applicable Environmental Laws and that no further action is required), then (1) Emerald shall convey to Liberty the Burgundy Wellbore
Interests in exchange for the payment by Liberty of the Burgundy Property Expenses, and (2) Liberty shall assume the Burgundy
Liabilities, including Environmental Liabilities associated with the Burgundy Wellbore Interests (but not including the payment
of any Burgundy Remediation Costs).

 

(f)          If
the Remediation is not completed or the Landowner Releases are not delivered on or prior to the Final Settlement Date, then unless
Liberty delivers written notice electing to acquire the Burgundy Wellbore Interests within ten (10) days following the Final Settlement
Date, the Burgundy Wellbore Interests shall be permanently excluded from the Emerald Assets acquired pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(g)          In
no event shall any expenses incurred by Emerald be counted toward the Aggregate Environmental Deductible for purposes of Section
5.4.

the Liberty Assets or impair Liberty’s ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to assume
the liabilities to be assumed by Liberty under this Agreement.

 

6.6           Material

Prior to execution of this Agreement, Liberty has provided Emerald or made available to Emerald, true, correct and complete copies
of the Liberty Material Agreements. To Liberty’s Knowledge, the Liberty Material Agreements are in full force and effect
in accordance with their terms, are valid and binding obligations of Liberty, and to Liberty’s Knowledge, are enforceable

Projects. Except as described on Schedule 6.7 (“Liberty Capital Expenditures”),
(i) Liberty has incurred no expenses, and has made no commitments to make expenditures in connection with the ownership or operation
of the Liberty Assets after the Effective Time (other than with respect to routine operations performed in the ordinary course

all taxable periods prior to the taxable period in which this Agreement is executed that were required to be paid prior to the
Effective Time have been paid. All income Taxes pertaining to Liberty’s ownership of the Liberty Assets that, if unpaid,
could give rise to a Lien or other claim against any of the Liberty Assets have been properly paid. Liberty has not received written

6.14         Calls
on Production. Except as set forth on Schedule 6.14, Liberty has not (i)  received any material advance,
“take-or-pay” or other similar payments under production sales contracts that entitle the purchasers to “make
up” or otherwise receive deliveries of Hydrocarbons without paying at such time the contract price therefore or (ii) 
taken or received any amount of Hydrocarbons under any gas balancing agreements or any similar arrangements not accounted for

to the Liberty Assets are subject to a sales contract (other than contracts terminable on no more than thirty (30) days’
notice or in accordance with rights of termination by non-operators under the applicable joint operating agreement) and no Person
has any call upon, option to purchase or similar rights with respect to the production from the Liberty Assets; production from
the Liberty Assets is not bound by any gas dedications or subject to any monetary or in kind through-put fees or charges in connection
with gathering or transportation; and the Liberty Assets are not bound by futures, hedge, swap, collar, put, call, floor, cap,
option or other contracts that are intended to benefit from, relate to or reduce or eliminate the risk of fluctuations in the
price of commodities, including Hydrocarbons, securities, foreign exchange rates or interest rates that will continue after Closing.
To Liberty’s Knowledge, proceeds from the sale of oil, condensate, and gas from the Liberty Assets are being received by
Liberty, as applicable, in a timely manner and are not being held in suspense for any reason.

not relying upon) any other express or implied representation or warranty with respect to Liberty (including the value, condition
or use of any Liberty Asset) or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Liberty disclaims any other representations

and warranty by Emerald)(the “Emerald Disclosed Materials”), Emerald represents and warrants to Liberty
as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date as follows:

 




    -33-

and Standing. Emerald Oil is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of Delaware,
(ii) Emerald WB is a limited liability company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of Colorado,
and (iii) each of Emerald Oil and Emerald WB is duly qualified to carry on its business in such other jurisdictions as may be

7.2           Power.
Emerald has all requisite power and authority to carry on its business as presently conducted, to enter into this Agreement, and
to perform its obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery of this Agreement does not, and the fulfillment of and compliance

governing documents, or, to Emerald’s Knowledge, any judgment, decree, order, statute, rule or regulation applicable to
Emerald.

 

7.3           Authorization
and Enforceability. Assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Liberty, this Agreement constitutes Emerald’s
legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject, however, to the effects of bankruptcy,

regardless whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.

for Brokers’ Fees. Emerald has not incurred any liability, contingent or otherwise, for investment bankers’, brokers’
or finders’ fees relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for which Liberty shall have any responsibility

liabilities to be assumed by Emerald under this Agreement.

Emerald Assets; (d) any Tax partnership agreement of or binding upon Emerald affecting any of the Emerald Assets; and (e) any

Prior to execution of this Agreement, Emerald has provided Liberty or made available to Liberty, true, correct and complete copies
of the Emerald Material Agreements. To Emerald’s Knowledge, the Emerald Material Agreements are in full force and effect
in accordance with their terms, are valid and binding obligations of Emerald, and to Emerald’s Knowledge, are enforceable
in accordance with their terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent transfer, moratorium
and similar Laws affecting creditor’s rights generally and by equitable principles.

Projects. Except as described on Schedule 7.8 (“Emerald Capital Expenditures”),
(i) Emerald has incurred no expenses, and has made no commitments to make expenditures in connection with the ownership or operation
of the Emerald Assets after the Effective Time (other than with respect to routine operations performed in the ordinary course
of operating the existing Wells), which expenditures are, individually, or in the aggregate, estimated to cost exceeds five hundred
thousand dollars ($500,000), net to Emerald’s interest, and (ii) no contractual obligations, proposals or authorities for
expenditures are currently outstanding (whether made by Emerald or by any other party) to drill additional wells, or to deepen,

cost exceeds five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000), net to Emerald’s interest.

all taxable periods prior to the taxable period in which this Agreement is executed that were required to be paid prior to the
Effective Time have been paid. All income Taxes pertaining to Emerald’s ownership of the Emerald Assets that, if unpaid,
could give rise to a Lien or other claim against any of the Emerald Assets have been properly paid. Emerald has not received written
notice of any pending claim against or audit of Emerald from any taxing authority for the assessment of any material Tax pertaining
to the Emerald Assets that, if unpaid, could give rise to a Lien or other claim against any of the Emerald Assets.

with Law And Government Authorizations. To Emerald’s Knowledge, the Emerald Assets are being operated in compliance
with all applicable Laws except for such noncompliance that would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse

addressed in Section 7.9 and Article V, respectively.

Status/Rentals/Royalties. To Emerald’s Knowledge, all rentals, royalties and operating expenses payable with respect
to the Emerald Assets prior to the Effective Time, have been duly and properly paid in all material respects, except as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. To Emerald’s Knowledge, there are no currently pending
requests or demands for payments, adjustments of payments or performance pursuant to obligations under the Leases, to the extent
that non-compliance with the forgoing would have a Material Adverse Effect on any of the Emerald Assets.

 

7.14         Well
Status. Except as set forth in Schedule 7.14, to the Knowledge of Emerald, there are no wells located on the
Emerald Assets that: (a) Emerald is obligated by Law or contract to currently plug and abandon; or (b) to the extent
plugged and abandoned, have not been plugged in accordance with applicable material requirements of each Governmental Entity having
jurisdiction over the Emerald Assets.

 

7.15         Calls
on Production. Except as set forth on Schedule 7.15, Emerald has not (i)  received any material advance,
“take-or-pay” or other similar payments under production sales contracts that entitle the purchasers to “make
up” or otherwise receive deliveries of Hydrocarbons without paying at such time the contract price therefore or (ii) 
taken or received any amount of Hydrocarbons under any gas balancing agreements or any similar arrangements not accounted for
in a purchase price adjustment that permit any Person thereafter to receive any portion of the interest of Emerald to “balance”
any disproportionate allocation of Hydrocarbons. Except as set forth on Schedule 7.15, no Hydrocarbons attributable
to the Emerald Assets are subject to a sales contract (other than contracts terminable on no more than thirty (30) days’
notice or in accordance with rights of termination by non-operators under the applicable joint operating agreement) and no Person
has any call upon, option to purchase or similar rights with respect to the production from the Emerald Assets; production from
the Emerald Assets is not bound by any gas dedications or subject to any monetary or in kind through-put fees or charges in connection
with gathering or transportation; and the Emerald Assets are not bound by futures, hedge, swap, collar, put, call, floor, cap,
option or other contracts that are intended to benefit from, relate to or reduce or eliminate the risk of fluctuations in the
price of commodities, including Hydrocarbons, securities, foreign exchange rates or interest rates that will continue after Closing.
To Emerald’s Knowledge, proceeds from the sale of oil, condensate, and gas from the Emerald Assets are being received by
Emerald, as applicable, in a timely manner and are not being held in suspense for any reason.

(b)          Restriction
on Operations. Subject to Section 8.1(a) and except as otherwise provided in this Section 8.1(b), unless
Transferor obtains the prior written consent of Transferee to act otherwise, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, Transferor will use commercially reasonable efforts within the constraints of the applicable operating
agreements and other applicable agreements not to: (i) abandon any part of the Assets (except in the ordinary course of business,
Leases that have terminated in the ordinary course of business based upon the expiration of their primary terms, or Leases that
are no longer capable of production in paying quantities); (ii) except for the Capital Projects listed on Schedule 6.7
and operations consistent with the existing drilling plan attached hereto as Schedule 8.1(b), approve any operations
on the Assets anticipated in any instance to cost more than two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) per activity,
net to Transferor’s interest (excepting emergency operations required under presently existing contractual obligations, ongoing
commitments under existing AFEs and operations undertaken to avoid a monetary penalty or forfeiture provision of any applicable
agreement or order all of which shall be deemed to be approved, provided Transferor immediately notifies Transferee of any emergency
operation or operation to avoid monetary penalty or forfeiture excepted herein); or (iii) convey or dispose of any part of
the Assets (other than replacement of equipment or sale of Hydrocarbons produced from the Assets in the ordinary course of business).

 

(c)          Consents.
For the purposes of obtaining the written consents for AFEs required in this Section 8.1, Liberty designates the following
contact person: Paul Vitek, and Emerald designates the following contact person Ryan Smith, in each case, at the address and telephone

(f)          Suspense

moneys are held in suspense or other information identifying the proper disposition of such moneys and (b) Transferor’s

of such moneys held in suspense to the party or parties which or who are entitled to receive payment of the same, and hereby agrees
to indemnify, defend and hold Transferor harmless from any Claims therefor.

 

8.2          Covenants
and Agreements of Transferee. Transferee covenants and agrees with Transferor that Transferee shall use all reasonable efforts

8.3          Covenants
and Agreements of the Parties.

 

(a)          Communication
Between the Parties Regarding Breach. If Transferee or Transferor acquires Knowledge during its due diligence that leads either
Party to believe that the other Party has materially breached a representation or warranty under this Agreement, the non-breaching
Party shall inform the alleged breaching Party in writing of such potential breach as soon as possible, but in any event, at or
prior to Closing.

 

(b)          Casualty
Loss. Prior to Closing, if a portion of the Assets is destroyed by fire or other casualty or if a portion of the Assets is
taken or threatened to be taken in condemnation or under the right of eminent domain (“Casualty Loss”),
Transferee shall not be obligated to purchase such Asset. If Transferee declines to purchase such Asset, the Purchase Price shall
be reduced by the Allocated Value of such Asset. If Transferee elects to purchase such Asset, the Purchase Price shall be reduced
by the estimated cost to repair such Asset (with equipment of similar utility), less all insurance proceeds which shall be payable
to Transferee, up to the Allocated Value thereof (the reduction being the “Net Casualty Loss”). Transferor,
at its sole option, may elect to cure such Casualty Loss and, in such event, Transferor shall be entitled to all insurance proceeds.
If Transferor elects to cure such Casualty Loss, Transferor may replace any personal property that is the subject of a Casualty
Loss with equipment of similar grade and utility, or replace any real property with real property of similar nature and kind if
such property is acceptable to Transferee in its sole discretion. If Transferor elects to cure the Casualty Loss, Transferee shall
purchase the affected Asset at Closing for the Allocated Value thereof.

 

(c)          Cooperation
and Good Faith. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, Transferee and Transferor will use
their respective reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other Party or Parties hereto in doing, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and
make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions, including using reasonable efforts to: (i) cause
the conditions set forth in Article 10 to be satisfied and (ii) execute or deliver any additional instruments reasonably
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement;
provided, however, that the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.3(d) will not require (y) any Party to perform,
satisfy or discharge any obligations of any other Party under this Agreement or otherwise or (z) Transferor or Transferee to pay
any money or other consideration or grant forbearances to any third party in order to perform, satisfy or discharge any of its
obligations under this Agreement.

 

(d)          Successor
Operator. Promptly after Closing, Transferor shall send notices (in form mutually agreed to by Transferee) to co-owners, if
any, of those Assets that Transferor currently operates stating that Liberty Management (in the case of Liberty) and Emerald WB
(in the case of Emerald), is resigning as operator, effective upon the Closing Date, and providing notice that Transferee or one
of its Affiliates shall become (or to the extent governed by an operating agreement or similar agreement, recommending that Transferee
be elected) successor operator for the Assets operated by Transferor. Transferor makes no representations or warranties to Transferee
as to the transferability of operatorship of any Assets which Transferor currently operates. Rights and obligations associated
with operatorship of the Assets may be governed by operating agreements or similar agreements and will be decided in accordance
with the terms of such agreements.

TAX MATTERS

 

9.1           Production
Tax Liability. Subject to the treatment of ad valorem Taxes provided below, all Production Taxes shall be allocated between
Transferor and Transferee as of the Effective Time for all taxable periods that include the Effective Time. All Production Taxes
that are not ad valorem taxes shall be allocated to Transferor to the extent they relate to production prior to the Effective
Time and to Transferee to the extent they relate to production on or after the Effective Time. No liability for Production Taxes
shall duplicate an adjustment to the Liberty Assets Preliminary Adjusted Purchase Price or the Emerald Assets Preliminary Adjusted
Purchase Price, as applicable, made pursuant to Section 2.4. Ad valorem Taxes for each assessment period shall be allocated
to Transferor based on the percentage of the assessment period occurring before the Effective Time and to Transferee based on
the percentage of the assessment period occurring on or after the Effective Time. Each Party shall promptly furnish to the other
copies of any Production Tax assessments and statements (or invoices therefor from the operator of the applicable Assets) received
by it to the extent such assessment, statement, or invoice relates to a Production Tax allocable to the other Party under this
Section. Each Party shall timely pay all Production Taxes subject to allocation under this Section and shall furnish to the other
Party evidence of such payment. The Parties shall estimate all Taxes (excluding Transferor’s income, franchise, or margin
Taxes) attributable to the ownership or operation of the Assets to the extent they relate to the period on and after the Effective
Time and through the date hereof and all Transfer Taxes and incorporate such estimates into the Preliminary Settlement Statement.
The actual amounts (to the extent the actual amounts differ from the estimates included in the Preliminary Settlement Statement
and are known at the time of the Final Settlement Statement) shall be accounted for in the Final Settlement Statement. If the
actual amounts are not known at the time of the Final Settlement Statement, the amounts shall be re-estimated based on the best
information available at the time of the Final Settlement Statement. When the actual amounts are known, Emerald and Liberty shall
make such payments to the other (if any) as are necessary to effect the allocation of Taxes described in this Section 9.1.

 

9.2           Transfer
Taxes. All sales, use or other Taxes (other than Taxes on gross income, net income or gross receipts) and duties, levies,
recording fees or other governmental charges incurred by or imposed with respect to the property transfers undertaken pursuant
to this Agreement (“Transfer Taxes”) shall be the responsibility of, and shall be paid by, Emerald provided
that, in the event that Liberty pays any Transfer Tax, Emerald shall promptly reimburse Liberty for such payment (without duplication
to any adjustment to the Liberty Assets Purchase Price or the Emerald Assets Purchase Price, as applicable). The Parties
shall reasonably cooperate in taking steps that would minimize or eliminate any Transfer Taxes. 

 




    -41-
     
    

 

9.3           Tax
Reports and Returns. For Tax periods in which the Effective Time occurs, Transferor agrees to forward to Transferee within
five (5) days of receipt copies of any Tax reports and returns received or filed by Transferor after Closing and provide Transferee
with any information Transferor has that is reasonably necessary for Transferee to file any required Tax Return related to the
Assets. Transferee agrees to file all Tax Returns and reports applicable to the Assets that Transferee is required to file after
the Closing and, subject to the provisions of Section 9.1, to pay all required Production Taxes payable with respect
to the Assets.

 

9.4           Tax
Cooperation. The Parties shall cooperate fully as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection
with the filing of any Tax Returns and any audit, litigation or other proceeding (each, a “Tax Proceeding”)
with respect to Taxes relating to or in connection with the Assets. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the
other Party’s request) the provision of such records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return
or Tax Proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation
of any material provided hereunder.

days after receipt of such statement, Emerald shall deliver to Liberty a written report containing any changes that Emerald proposes

    -47-
     
    

 

(b)          Emerald’s
Indemnification. Emerald shall defend, indemnify and save and hold harmless Liberty and its Affiliates and their respective
members, managers, shareholders, officers, directors, employees and agents (the “Liberty Indemnified Parties”),

(ii) any breach by Emerald of any of Emerald’s representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in the
certificate delivered pursuant to Section 12.3, or (iii) any breach of Emerald’s covenants or agreements contained

(c)          Limitations
on Indemnity. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, each of Liberty and Emerald shall have no liability

2% of the Emerald Assets Purchase Price (as to each of (i) and (ii), the “Deductible”), after which point

14.4(a)(ii) or (b)(ii), as applicable, with respect to Losses suffered by the Emerald Indemnified Parties or the Liberty
Indemnified Parties, as applicable shall not exceed (I) with respect to Liberty’s obligations under Section 14.4(a)(ii),

(d)          Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, from and after Closing, the Parties’ sole and exclusive remedy against

Agreement is set forth in this Section 14.4, and if no such right of indemnification is expressly provided, then such claims
are hereby waived to the fullest extent permitted by Law; provided however, that each Party shall retain the right to seek
injunctive or other equitable relief, including specific performance for breaches of this Agreement. Except as set forth in the
preceding sentence, upon Closing, each Party releases, remises, and forever discharges the other Party from any and all suits,
legal or administrative proceedings, claims, demands, damages, Losses, costs, liabilities, interest, or causes of action whatsoever,
in law or in equity, known or unknown, which such Parties might now or subsequently may have, based on, relating to, or arising
out of this Agreement or such Party’s ownership, use, or operation of the Assets, or the condition, quality, status, or nature

or not caused by a preexisting condition.

(e)          EACH
PARTY CONFIRMS THAT IT IS NOT RELYING ON ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OTHER THAN THOSE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT,
AND EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS NO RELIANCE CONFIRMATION IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT TO THE OTHER PARTY’S WILLINGNESS
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND CONSUMMATE THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 

14.5         Procedure.
The indemnifications contained in Section 14.4 shall be implemented as follows:

 

(a)          Claim
Notice. The Party seeking indemnification under the terms of this Agreement (“Indemnified Party”)
shall submit a written “Claim Notice” to the other Party (“Indemnifying Party”)
which, to be effective, must be delivered prior to the end of the Survival Period applicable under Section 14.6 to the representation
or warranty that is the subject of such Claim Notice and must state: (i) the amount of each payment claimed by an Indemnified
Party to be owing, (ii) the basis for such claim, with supporting documentation, and (iii) a list identifying to the
extent reasonably possible each separate item of Loss for which payment is so claimed. Unless, within sixty days of receipt of
a Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party provides written notice to the Indemnified Party that it contests the Losses identified
in such Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party shall, subject to the other terms of this Section 14.5, pay to the Indemnified
Party the amount of the Losses related to such indemnification claim or the uncontested portion thereof. If the Indemnifying Party
objects to a Claim Notice on the basis that it lacks sufficient information, it shall promptly request from the Indemnified Party
any specific additional information reasonably necessary for it to assess such indemnification claim, and the Indemnified Party
shall provide the additional information reasonably requested. Upon receipt of such additional information, the Indemnifying Party
shall notify the Indemnified Party of any withdrawal or modification of the objection. All disputed indemnification claims shall
be resolved by Emerald and Liberty in accordance with either (A) a mutual agreement between Emerald and Liberty, which shall
be memorialized in writing, or (B) final arbitration in accordance with Section 15.13.

 




    -49-
     
    

 

(b)          Information.
Promptly after the Indemnified Party receives notice of a claim or legal action by a third party that may result in a Loss for
which indemnification may be sought under this Article 14 (a “Claim”), the Indemnified Party
shall give written notice of such Claim to the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party or its counsel so requests, the Indemnified
Party shall furnish the Indemnifying Party with copies of all pleadings and other information with respect to such Claim. At the
election of the Indemnifying Party made within sixty (60) days after receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party shall permit
the Indemnifying Party to assume control of such Claim (to the extent only that such Claim, legal action or other matter relates
to a Loss for which the Indemnifying Party is liable), including the determination of all appropriate actions, the negotiation
of settlements on behalf of the Indemnified Party, and the conduct of litigation through attorneys of the Indemnifying Party’s
choice; provided, however, that no such settlement can result in any liability or cost to the Indemnified Party for which
it is entitled to be indemnified hereunder without its consent. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume control, (i) any
expense incurred by the Indemnified Party thereafter for investigation or defense of the matter shall be borne by the Indemnified
Party, and (ii) the Indemnified Party shall give all reasonable information and assistance, other than pecuniary, that the
Indemnifying Party shall deem necessary to the proper defense of such Claim, legal action, or other matter. In the absence of such
an election, the Indemnified Party will use its best efforts to defend, at the Indemnifying Party’s expense, any claim, legal
action or other matter to which such other Party’s indemnification under this Article 14 applies until the Indemnifying
Party assumes such defense, and, if the Indemnifying Party fails to assume such defense within the time period provided above,
settle the same in the Indemnified Party’s reasonable discretion at the Indemnifying Party’s expense with the Indemnifying
Party’s consent which shall not be unreasonably withheld. If such a Claim requires immediate action, both the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party will cooperate in good faith to take appropriate action so as not to jeopardize defense of such
Claim or either Party’s position with respect to such Claim. If the Indemnifying Party is entitled to, and does, assume the
defense of any such Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel at its own expense and to participate
in the defense thereof; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall pay the reasonable
attorneys’ fees of the Indemnified Party if the Indemnified Party’s counsel shall have advised the Indemnified Party
that there is a conflict of interest that could make it inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct to have
common counsel for the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party (provided that the Indemnifying Party shall not be responsible
for paying for more than one separate firm of attorneys and one local counsel to represent all of the Indemnified Parties subject
to such Claim).

 

14.6         Survival
of Warranties, Representations and Covenants. All representations and warranties contained in Articles 3 and 4
of this Agreement shall survive the Closing and remain in full force and effect until 5:00 p.m., Denver, Colorado time, on
the date that is six (6) months after the date hereof, at which time they shall terminate, except that those representations
and warranties set forth in Sections 6.1 (Status), 6.2 (Power) and 6.3 (Authorization and Enforceability)
made by Liberty, and Sections 7.1 (Organization and Standing), 7.2 (Power) and 7.3 (Authorization and Enforceability)
made by Emerald (those representations made by Liberty and Emerald, collectively the “Fundamental Representations”),
will survive indefinitely (the applicable period, being referred to herein as the “Survival Period”).
The covenants and performance obligations contained in this Agreement that contemplate performance after the Closing shall survive
the Closing and shall continue until all obligations with respect thereto shall have been performed or satisfied or shall have
been terminated in accordance with their terms. Both Parties acknowledge that the limitations on survival in this Section 14.6
are a contractual statute of limitations that limits such Party’s ability to make a claim against the other Party that
such Party may otherwise have available under Law.

 




    -50-
     
    

 

14.7         Reservation
as to Non-Parties. Nothing herein is intended to limit or otherwise waive any recourse Emerald or Liberty may have against
any non-party for any obligations or liabilities that may be incurred with respect to the Assets.

 

14.8         Reductions
in Losses. The amount of any Losses for which an Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnity under this Article 14
shall be reduced by the amount of insurance proceeds realized by the Indemnified Person or its Affiliates with respect to such
Losses (net of any collection costs, and excluding the proceeds of any insurance policy issued or underwritten by the Indemnified
Person or its insurance captive or other Affiliate), and by the amount of any net Tax benefit actually realized by either Party
as a result of the events giving rise to the Losses in question.

 

14.9         Waiver.
Neither Party shall have any obligation or liability under this Agreement or in connection with or with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement for any breach, misrepresentation, or noncompliance with respect to any representation, warranty,
covenant, indemnity, or obligation if such breach, misrepresentation, or noncompliance shall have been waived by the other Party,
or if the other Party had knowledge of the relevant facts at or before Closing.

the hearing, the Parties shall present such evidence and witnesses as they may choose, with or without counsel. Adherence to formal

15.15         Severability.
Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction will, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective
to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement, and any
such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction will not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other
jurisdiction. Should any provision of this Agreement be or become invalid or unenforceable as a whole or in part, this Agreement
shall be reformed to come closest to the original intent and purposes of the parties hereto.

 

15.16         Liberty
Resources Guaranty. Liberty Resources hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees the full and prompt payment and performance
of all obligations of Liberty to pay any amounts and perform any obligations under this Agreement prior to or concurrent with

in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. Liberty Resources acknowledges that valuable consideration supports this guaranty
and that it executed this guaranty as an inducement to Emerald to enter into this Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated
