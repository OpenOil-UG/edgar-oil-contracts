Unless otherwise provided by the Board prior to the applicable date of grant, the Black Scholes option valuation for a Stock Option to be granted on any date will be based on the following assumptions:(i)    the then current price of a share of Common Stock is equal to the Market Value per Share of Common Stock as of the date of grant of the Stock Option; (ii)    the per share Option Price is equal to the Market Value per Share of Common Stock as of the date of grant of the Stock Option;(iii)    the time until expiration of the Stock Option is equal to the actual time until expiration of the Stock Option (determined without regard to the provisions of Sections 12(e)(vii) and 12(e)(viii));(iv)    the risk-free interest rate is the asked yield rate, as of the business day preceding the date of grant of the Stock Option and as reported in the Wall Street Journal, for the U.S. Treasury Note or Bond having a maturity date that is closest to the date that is five years after the date of grant of the Stock Option;(v)    the volatility of the price of the Common Stock is calculated based on the closing price of a share of Common Stock on the last trading day of each month for each of the 60 months preceding the month in which the date of grant of the Stock Option occurs; and 14(vi)    the dividend yield on the Common Stock equals the rate determined by dividing the product of four and the most recent quarterly dividend on the Common Stock as of the date of grant of the Stock Option by the Market Value per Share of Common Stock as of the date of grant of the Stock Option.(d)    Each grant of Restricted Shares to an Eligible Director may utilize any or all of the authorizations, and will be subject to all of the requirements, contained in the following provisions:(i)    At the time of grant of Restricted Shares to an Eligible Director, either (A) a stock certificate evidencing the shares of Common Stock granted will be registered in the Eligible Director’s name to be held by the Company for his or her account or (B) an appropriate entry evidencing the Eligible Director’s ownership of the shares of Common Stock granted will be made in the stock ownership records or other books and records maintained by or on behalf of the Company.  The Eligible Director will have the entire beneficial ownership interest in, and all rights and privileges of a stockholder as to, such Restricted Shares, including the right to vote such Restricted Shares and, unless the Board will determine otherwise, the right to receive dividends thereon, subject to the following: (1) subject to Section 12(d)(iii), the Eligible Director will not be entitled to delivery of any stock certificate evidencing such Restricted Shares until the expiration of the restriction period described in Section 12(d)(ii); (2) none of the Restricted Shares may be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged, or otherwise encumbered or disposed of during the restriction period; and (3) all of the Restricted Shares will be forfeited and all rights of the Eligible Director to the Restricted Shares will terminate without further obligation on the part of the Company unless the Eligible Director remains as a member of the Board for the entire restriction period, except as provided by Section 12(d)(iii).  Any shares of Common Stock or other securities or property received as a result of a transaction described in Section 14 will be subject to the same restrictions as such Restricted Shares.(ii)    Each grant of Restricted Shares under Section 12(a) or 12(b)(i) will become nonforfeitable and the restrictions described in Section 12(d)(i) will expire as to 1/3rd of the total number of shares subject thereto on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant of Restricted Shares; provided, in each case, that the Eligible Director who received the Restricted Shares has remained a member of the Board through each such anniversary date.  Each grant of Restricted Shares under Section 12(b)(ii) will become nonforfeitable and the restrictions described in Section 12(d)(i) will expire as to the total number of shares subject thereto on the first anniversary of the date of grant of Restricted Shares; provided, in each case, that the Eligible Director who received the Restricted Shares has remained a member of the Board through such anniversary date.15(iii)    Except as provided in an Evidence of Award, upon an Eligible Director’s ceasing to be a member of the Board prior to the end of a restriction period for any reason, the Eligible Director will immediately forfeit all Restricted Shares then subject to the restrictions of Section 12(d)(i), unless the Board, in its discretion, allows the Eligible Director to retain any or all of the Restricted Shares then subject to such restrictions, in which case the restriction period applicable to the retained shares will immediately expire and all restrictions applicable to the retained shares will immediately lapse.(iv)    At the end of the restriction period, or at such earlier time as provided for in Section 12(d)(iii) or as the Board, in its sole discretion, may otherwise determine, all restrictions applicable to the Restricted Shares will lapse and, if the Restricted Shares are evidenced by a stock certificate, a stock certificate evidencing a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of Restricted Shares, free of all restrictions, will be delivered to the Eligible Director.(e)    Each grant of Stock Options to an Eligible Director may utilize any or all of the authorizations, and will be subject to all the requirements, contained in the following provisions:(i)    Each grant will specify the Option Price, which will equal 100% of the Market Value per Share on the Date of Grant.(ii)    Each Stock Option will be exercisable only to the extent that it is vested.  Except as may otherwise be provided in the agreement evidencing the Stock Option or as determined by the Board, each Stock Option granted under Section 12(b)(ii) will vest as to 1/12th of the total number of shares of Common Stock subject thereto (rounded up to the nearest whole share) on the last day of the first full calendar month following the date of grant of the Stock Option, as to 1/12th of the total number of shares subject thereto (rounded up to the nearest whole share) on the last day of each of the 10 succeeding calendar months, and as to the balance of the shares of Common Stock subject thereto on the last day of the calendar month preceding the one-year anniversary of the date of grant of the Stock Option; provided, in each case, that the Eligible Director who received the Stock Option has remained a member of the Board through the respective vesting date.(iii)    No Stock Option will be exercisable more than ten years from the Date of Grant.(iv)    Each Stock Option granted to an Eligible Director will be a nonqualified stock option and will not be an “incentive stock option” within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code.16(v)    Each grant will specify whether the Option Price will be payable (A) in cash or by check acceptable to the Company, (B) by the actual or constructive transfer to the Company of shares of Common Stock owned by the Eligible Director and having an aggregate Market Value per Share at the date of exercise equal to the aggregate Option Price, (C) by authorizing the Company to withhold a number of shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable to the Eligible Director having an aggregate Market Value per Share on the date of exercise equal to the aggregate Option Price, (D) by a combination of such methods of payment or (E) by any other method of payment approved by the Board; provided, however, that the payment methods described in clauses (B) and (C) will not be available at any time that the Company is prohibited from purchasing or acquiring such shares of Common Stock.(vi)    During an Eligible Director’s lifetime, the Stock Option may be exercised only by the Eligible Director.  Stock Options will not be transferable, except for exercise by the Eligible Director’s legal representatives or heirs; provided, however, that an Eligible Director may, with prior approval from the Board (or its designee), transfer an exercisable Stock Option to (A) a member or members of the Eligible Director’s immediate family, (B) a trust, the beneficiaries of which consist exclusively of members of the Eligible Director’s immediate family, (C) a partnership, the partners of which consist exclusively of members of the Eligible Director’s immediate family, or (D) any similar entity created for the exclusive benefit of members of the Eligible Director’s immediate family; provided that no such transfer may be made in connection with a divorce or marital dissolution proceeding.  The Board or its designee must approve the form of any transfer of a Stock Option to or for the benefit of any immediate family member or members before such transfer will be recognized as valid hereunder.  For purposes of the preceding sentence, any remote, contingent interest of persons other than a member of the Eligible Director’s immediate family will be disregarded.  For purposes of this Section 12(e)(vi), immediate family means an Eligible Director’s spouse, children and grandchildren, including step and adopted children and grandchildren, but shall not include a former spouse.(vii)    Upon an Eligible Director’s ceasing to be a member of the Board for any reason other than death, each Stock Option of such Eligible Director will be exercisable only as to those shares of Common Stock which were then subject to the exercise of such Stock Option.  The Stock Option will expire: (A) unless exercised, five years after the Eligible Director’s retirement from the Board if the Eligible Director retires at or after age 55 with at least five years of service on the Board; (B) unless exercised, five years after the date the Eligible Director’s service on the Board is terminated due to the Eligible Director’s total and permanent disability; (C) upon the Eligible Director’s service on the Board being terminated for cause pursuant to Section 141(k) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (or any successor provision); or (D) unless exercised, three months after the date of such termination.  In no event, however, will any Stock 17Option be exercisable pursuant to this Section 12(e)(vii) after the tenth anniversary of the Date of Grant or after any earlier termination in accordance with the terms of the agreement evidencing the Stock Option.(viii)    Upon the death of an Eligible Director during his or her term of service on the Board, a Stock Option will be exercisable only as to those shares of Common Stock which were subject to the exercise of the Stock Option at the time of his or her death.  The Stock Option will expire, unless exercised by the Eligible Director’s legal representatives or heirs, five years after the date of death.  In no event, however, will any Stock Option be exercisable pursuant to this Section 12(e)(viii) after the tenth anniversary of the Date of Grant or after any earlier termination in accordance with the terms of the agreement evidencing the Stock Option.(ix)    Except as otherwise determined by the Board, the vesting schedule applicable to a Stock Option requires continued service through each applicable vesting date as a condition to the vesting of the applicable installment of the Stock Option.  Service for only a portion of a vesting period, even if substantial, will not entitle the Eligible Director to any proportionate vesting or avoid or mitigate a termination of rights and benefits upon or following a termination of service as a Board member as provided in Section 12(e)(vii) or 12(e)(viii).13.    Transferability.  Except as provided in Section 12(e)(vi) or as otherwise authorized by the Committee, no Award may be sold, pledged, assigned or transferred in any manner other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution; provided, however, that a Participant who is an officer of the Company may, with the prior approval of the Committee, transfer a Stock Option that is not intended to be an “incentive stock option” (within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code) to family members of the Participant, including to trusts in which family members of the Participant own more than 50% of the beneficial interests, to foundations in which family members of the Participant or the Participant controls the management of assets and to other entities in which more than 50% of the voting interests are owned by family members of the Participant or the Participant; provided further that no such transfer may be made in connection with a divorce or marital dissolution proceeding.  For purposes of this Section 13, family member shall not include a former spouse.  Except as otherwise authorized by the Committee, no Stock Option or Appreciation Right granted to a Participant will be exercisable during the Participant’s lifetime by any person other than the Participant or the Participant’s guardian or legal representative or any permitted transferee.14.    Adjustments.(a)    The Committee will make or provide for such adjustments in (i) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock specified in Sections 4 and 5, (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock covered by outstanding Stock Options, Appreciation Rights, Performance Shares and Restricted Stock Units granted under the Plan, (iii) the Option Price or Grant Price applicable to any Stock Options and Appreciation Rights, and (iv) the kind of shares covered by any such Awards (including shares of another issuer), 18as is equitably required to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights of Participants that otherwise would result from (x) any stock dividend, stock split, combination or exchange of shares, recapitalization or other change in the capital structure of the Company, or (y) any merger, consolidation, separation, spin-off, split-off, spin-out, split-up, reorganization, partial or complete liquidation or other distribution of assets, issuance of rights or warrants to purchase securities, or (z) any other corporate transaction or event having an effect similar to any of the foregoing.  In the event of any such transaction or event, the Committee, in its discretion, may provide in substitution for any or all outstanding Awards such alternative consideration as it, in good faith, may determine to be equitable in the circumstances and may require in connection with such substitution the surrender of all Awards so replaced.(b)    The Committee may accelerate the payment of, or vesting with respect to, any Award under the Plan upon the occurrence of a transaction or event described in this Section 14; provided, however, that in the case of any Award that constitutes a deferral of compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, the Committee will not accelerate the payment of the Award unless it determines in good faith that such transaction or event satisfies the requirements of a change in control event under guidance issued by the Secretary of the Treasury under Section 409A of the Code.15.    Fractional Shares.  Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary will be required to deliver any fractional share of Common Stock pursuant to the Plan.  The Committee may provide for the elimination of fractions or for the settlement of fractions in cash.16.    Withholding Taxes.  To the extent that the Company or a Subsidiary is required to withhold federal, state, local or foreign taxes in connection with any payment made or benefit realized by a Participant or other person under the Plan, and the amounts available to the Company or the Subsidiary for such withholding are insufficient, it will be a condition to the receipt of such payment or the realization of such benefit that the Participant or such other person make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for payment of the balance of such taxes required to be withheld.  If a Participant’s Award is to be paid in the form of shares of Common Stock and the Participant fails to make arrangements for the payment of tax, the Company or the Subsidiary may withhold shares of Common Stock having a value equal to the amount required to be withheld.  In addition, if permitted by the Committee, the Participant or such other person may elect to have any withholding obligation of the Company or the Subsidiary satisfied with shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be transferred to the Participant or such other person in payment of the Participant’s Award.  However, without the consent of the Committee, shares of Common Stock will not be withheld in excess of the minimum number of shares required to satisfy the withholding obligation of the Company or the Subsidiary.17.    Administration of the Plan.(a)    Unless the administration of the Plan has been expressly assumed by the Board pursuant to a resolution of the Board, the Plan will be administered by the Committee, which at all times will consist of three or more Directors appointed by the Board, all of whom are intended (i) to meet all applicable independence requirements of 19the New York Stock Exchange or the principal national securities exchange or principal market on or in which the Common Stock is traded and (ii) to qualify as “non-employee directors” as defined in Rule 16b-3 and as “outside directors” as defined in regulations adopted under Section 162(m) of the Code, as such terms may be amended from time to time; provided, however, that the failure of a member of the Committee to so qualify will not invalidate any Award granted under the Plan.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of Section 12 will be administered by the Board.  A majority of the Committee will constitute a quorum, and the action of the members of the Committee present at any meeting at which a quorum is present, or acts unanimously approved in writing, will be the acts of the Committee.(b)    The Committee has the full authority and discretion to administer the Plan and to take any action that is necessary or advisable in connection with the administration of the Plan, including without limitation the authority and discretion to interpret and construe any provision of the Plan or of any agreement, notification or document evidencing an Award.  The interpretation and construction by the Committee of any such provision and any determination by the Committee pursuant to any provision of the Plan or of any such agreement, notification or document will be final and conclusive.  No member of the Committee will be liable for any such action or determination made in good faith.(c)    To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Committee may delegate its authority under the Plan to a subcommittee of the Committee, to one or more committees of the Board or to one or more executive officers of the Company; provided, however, that no delegation may be made of authority to take an action which is required by Rule 16b-3 to be taken by “non-employee directors” in order that the Plan and transactions thereunder meet the requirements of such Rule.(d)    It is the Company’s intention that any Award granted under the Plan that constitutes a deferral of compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and the guidance issued by the Secretary of the Treasury under Section 409A satisfy the requirements of Section 409A.  In granting such an Award, the Committee will use its best efforts to exercise its authority under the Plan with respect to the terms of such Award in a manner that the Committee determines in good faith will cause the Award to comply with Section 409A and thereby avoid the imposition of penalty taxes and interest upon the Participant receiving the Award.  Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan or an Evidence of Award to the contrary, (i) if the Company makes a good faith determination that a payment of an Award (A) constitutes a deferral of compensation for purposes of Section 409A of the Code, (B) is made to a Participant by reason of his or her “separation from service” (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) and (C) at the time such payment would otherwise be made the Participant is a “specified employee” (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code), the payment will be delayed until the first day of the seventh month following the date of such separation from service, and (ii) if a Change in Control would be the date of payment of an Award that is determined to constitute a deferral of compensation, but the Change in Control 20does not constitute a change in the ownership or effective control of the Company, or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code), then the date of payment will be determined without regard to the occurrence of the Change in Control.(e)    With respect to the administration of the provisions of Section 12 or if the administration of the Plan is assumed by the Board pursuant to Section 17(a), the Board will have the same authority, power, duties, responsibilities and discretion given to the Committee under the terms of the Plan.18.    Amendments and Other Matters.(a)    The Plan may be amended from time to time by the Board or, with respect to those provisions of the Plan other than Section 12, the Committee; provided, however, that the Plan may not be amended without further approval by the stockholders of the Company if such amendment would result in the Plan no longer satisfying any applicable requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or the principal national securities exchange on which the Common Stock is traded), Rule 16b-3 or Section 162(m) of the Code.(b)    Neither the Committee nor the Board will authorize the amendment of any outstanding Stock Option to reduce the Option Price without the further approval of the stockholders of the Company.  Furthermore, no Stock Option will be cancelled and replaced with Stock Options having a lower Option Price without further approval of the stockholders of the Company.  The provisions of this Section 18(b) are intended to prohibit the repricing of “underwater” Stock Options and will not be construed to prohibit the adjustments provided for in Section 14.(c)    The Plan may be terminated at any time by action of the Board.  The termination of the Plan will not adversely affect the terms of any outstanding Award.(d)    The Company will not be required to issue, and neither the Company nor a Subsidiary will be required to transfer, shares of Common Stock under the Plan prior to (i) the obtaining of any approval from any governmental agency which the Company, in its sole discretion, determines to be necessary or advisable, (ii) the admission of such shares to listing on any stock exchange on which the Common Stock may then be listed, and (iii) the completion of any registration or other qualification of such shares under any state or Federal law or rulings or regulations of any governmental body which the Company, in its sole discretion, determines to be necessary or advisable.(e)    The Plan does not confer upon any Participant any right with respect to continuance of employment or other service with the Company or any Subsidiary, nor will it interfere in any way with any right the Company or any Subsidiary would otherwise have to terminate such Participant’s employment or other service at any time.21(f)    If the Committee determines, with the advice of legal counsel, that any provision of the Plan would prevent the payment of any Award intended to qualify as performance-based compensation within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code from so qualifying, such Plan provision will be invalid and cease to have any effect without affecting the validity or effectiveness of any other provision of the Plan.(g)    No Participant will have any of the rights of a stockholder with respect to shares of Common Stock subject to an Award prior to the date as of which he or she is actually recorded as the holder of such shares upon the stock records of the Company.19.    Governing Law.  The Plan, all Awards and all actions taken under the Plan and the Awards will be governed in all respects in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, including without limitation, the Delaware statute of limitations, but without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of laws of such State.22
