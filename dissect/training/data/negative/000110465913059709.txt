6.7                   Willful Misconduct/No Consequential Damages.
 
(a)                                 NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THE CONTRACT, IT IS EXPRESSLY AGREED THAT NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL LOSS.
 
(b)                                 Except as to Clause 6.5(a) above, the release, defense, and indemnity obligations of Contractor and/or Operator in this Contract shall not apply to the extent the death, illness, injury, damage, or loss to property in relation to which a claim is made is the result of the Willful Misconduct of the person or entity seeking indemnity or release.

8.7                               Tax Invoicing.  If Contractor has a legal responsibility to collect any Taxes (including but not limited to value added tax, turnover tax, or any other similar indirect tax) directly from Operator for payment to the appropriate taxing authorities, the portion of any payment from Operator to Contractor representing such Taxes shall be separately stated in the invoice.  Absent such legal requirement, Contractor shall not identify any separate item constituting Taxes.  Operator shall not be obligated to pay invoices that do not comply with invoicing procedures, described in Exhibit 3 of the Country Contract or as otherwise agreed by Contractor and Operator in a similar document attached to a work order.

(a)                     to suspend immediately all or any of the operations then in progress and apply the provisions of sub clause 5.1 hereof, or
 
(b)                     to give such receiver, liquidator or any other person in whom the Contract may become vested the option of carrying out the Contract subject to such party providing a guarantee in an amount to be agreed between the Parties for the due and faithful performance of the Contract without prejudice in either event to any right of action or remedy which shall have accrued or shall accrue thereafter to Operator.

10.2            If a Force Majeure Event occurs, the Party affected by such event will promptly notify the other and describe the circumstances causing the non-performance.  A Party rendered unable to perform its obligations by a Force Majeure Event shall be referred to in this Clause as an FM Party.  The rights or obligation(s) of the FM Party unable to perform its obligations hereunder, so far as it is affected by such Force Majeure Event, shall be suspended during the continuation of any inability so caused and such cause shall, as far as practicable, be remedied with all reasonable diligence.  The FM Party shall as soon as reasonably possible, give notice in writing to the other Party of such Force Majeure Event and the reasons therefor.  The rights and obligations of the Parties as have been thus affected shall be suspended for the duration of such prevention.  The FM Party shall keep the other Party reasonably informed as to the status of the Force Majeure Event and all actions being taken by the FM Party to remedy its inability to perform the Drilling Services.

10.4            In the event Operator does not exercise this right and the performance of the Contract has been prevented for not less than one hundred twenty (120) consecutive days then Operator shall have the right to terminate the Contract or continue the Contract at the Standby Rate until such Force Majeure Event has been remedied, by giving written notice to Contractor.

In the event Operator fails to make payment when due on the undisputed portion of any invoice, interest at a rate of 1% per month shall accrue on the unpaid amount. No payment by Operator shall limit Operators rights to later dispute any of the charges invoiced or to claim unsatisfactory performance under the Contract, the Country Contract or any work order and payment shall not be construed as Operators acceptance of the Drilling Services.  Upon mutual agreement of Contractor and Operator (in which Contractor shall not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay any such agreement), Operator shall have the right to set off any loss, damage, liability or Claim which it may have against Contractor against payment it owes to Contractor under any of the Contract, the Country Contract or any work order.  Contractor shall submit its final invoice for Drilling Services performed within one hundred twenty (120) days of completion of the Final Well and Operators acceptance of the Drilling Services associated with each well or within one hundred twenty (120) days of the termination of the Contract or the Country Contract or any then active work order.

Country Specific Terms and Conditions
(Kosmos Energy Deepwater Morocco)
 
Clause 1.                                 Definitions
 
1.6                   Country of Operations means Republic of Morocco, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties in a work order.
 
Clause 8.                                 Taxes Responsibilities.
 
Contractor Tax Liability.  Except as otherwise provided below, Contractor assumes full and exclusive liability for the payment of all taxes including, by way of illustration and not limitation, corporate taxes, personal income taxes, payroll taxes, property taxes, and other direct taxes, as may be imposed on Contractor, in Morocco or  the country of Contractors registration in Morocco which directly result from the carrying out of the Drilling Services by Contractor, whatever may be the methods of assessment, calculation and recovery or any other taxes of similar nature that may be imposed by the Government of Morocco or by any country having jurisdiction to levy such taxes on Contractor as a result of the performance of the Drilling Services under this Country Contract (collectively, Taxes).
 
(a)                                 VAT Exemption.  Rates and prices under this Country Contract do not include any value added tax (VAT), turnover taxes, transaction taxes, use taxes, production taxes, consumption taxes, stamp taxes, nor any other taxes of similar nature assessed on supplies, equipment and services to be delivered to Operator or performed under this Country Contract.  Contractor shall separately state any value-added tax or similar tax in its invoice; however, Contractor shall not invoice Operator for any such tax where Operator has furnished evidence of exemption status to Contractor.
 
(b)                                 Withholding Taxes.  Operator shall have the right to withhold any Taxes and other government assessments on payments to Contractor to the extent required by Law or pursuant to the agreement with a host country and the rate set forth in any applicable work orders shall include such withholding taxes and other government assessments.  Upon payment of the amount withheld to the appropriate government entity or agency such amount withheld shall be deemed payment to the respective Contractor, and Operator shall have no further obligation to pay such amount to the respective Contractor.  Where Operator has withheld amounts due Contractor, Operator shall provide Contractor evidence of such tax withholding in the form of an original tax receipt or other evidence of payment in a timely manner, if requested.
 
(c)                                  Receipts.  Operator undertakes to provide the original withholding tax receipts issued by the relevant tax authorities together with details of the deductions covered within sixty (60) days of collection of said receipts from the tax authorities.  Operator shall make reasonable endeavors to obtain such receipts as soon as possible.  In the event Operator withholds Tax in excess of that required by Law, then Operator shall promptly reimburse Contractor for the amounts of Tax, which have been incorrectly withheld.  In the event of late payment to the tax authorities having jurisdiction, Operator shall be solely liable for the payment of penalties levied by the relevant tax authorities.
 
(d)                                 Tax Indemnities.  In addition to the general indemnities in Clause 6 of the GMC, Contractor shall defend, indemnify and hold Operator Group harmless from liability to any competent authority resulting from Contractors or Contractor Groups failure to make timely payment of, or timely filings with respect to, any obligations to pay Taxes incurred in respect to the Drilling Services.  Such indemnities shall include all penalties and interest imposed in addition to the Taxes due as a result of Contractor Groups failure to comply with reporting, filing, payment or procedural requirements.  Contractor shall be liable for and shall indemnify Operator Group for

any incremental withholding Taxes imposed by an appropriate government entity or agency on payments to Contractor in excess of amounts initially withheld by Operator per Clause 8(c) above.
 
(e)                                  Import/Export Customs Duties and Fees; Stamp Duties.  Where Operator and its contractors (including Contractor) are entitled to exemption from import duty with respect to materials or equipment, Operator shall provide an appropriate letter to enable Contractor to claim such exemption.  In any such case, should Contractor, through its Gross Negligence or Willful Misconduct, fail to obtain the exemption, the cost of the duty shall not be passed on to Operator but shall be the sole responsibility of Contractor.  In the event Operator has no import/export exemption, then Operator shall pay import/export license fees, import/export duties and stamp duties required to be incurred in respect to the Drilling Services.
 
(f)                                   Tax Invoicing.  If Contractor has a legal responsibility to collect any Taxes (including but not limited to VAT, or any other similar indirect tax) directly from Operator for payment to the appropriate taxing authorities, the portion of any payment from Operator to Contractor representing such Taxes shall be separately stated in the invoice on top of the agreed rates, fees and lump sums.  Absent such legal requirement, Contractor shall not identify any separate item constituting Taxes.  Operator shall not be obligated to pay invoices that do not comply with invoicing procedures, described in Exhibit 2 attached hereto (or as otherwise agreed by Contractor and Operator in a similar document attached to this Country Contract or any work order).
 
(h)  Future Legislation.  If, as a result of any future relevant fiscal legislation, regulation or law, or a change in the interpretation of existing fiscal legislation, regulation or law, after the contract award date, such future relevant fiscal legislation, regulation or law, or a change in the interpretation of existing fiscal legislation, regulation or law, being such that Contractor has to suffer an additional tax burden not included in its prices under this Country Contract, then it is agreed and understood that Contractor will be entitled to revise its prices in order to reflect the impact of such new fiscal legislation, regulation or law, or change in the interpretation of existing fiscal legislation, regulation or law,  so that Contractor does not lose nor benefit as a result thereof.
 
(i)                                     Moroccan Registration for Tax ID and VAT Exemption. Contractor must be registered in the Kingdom of Morocco and have a valid Moroccan Tax ID Number.  If Contractor is not registered in Morocco and does not have said Moroccan Tax ID Number, Contractor must complete this process.  If Contractor requests Operators assistance, Contractor must complete the documentation (on Contractors letterhead) as set out in Exhibit 2-B and return to Operator.  The Morocco Tax ID must be obtained before Exhibit 2-A is generated and the process to obtain the VAT Exemption Certificate can begin.

Purpose/objectives:
 
The purpose of the Well Construction Interface Document (WCID) is to ensure that all well construction work (drilling, suspension, completion, testing, workover and/or abandonment) is carried out in a manner to protect the safety and health of all workers and protect the environment.  There is an emphasis on prevention of loss of well control and the details of barrier controls. The WCID will align the goals and objectives of HSES with the well construction process.
 
· Tie the safety-critical well construction components and processes with the elements of the traditional safety case bridging document.
 
· Identify, eliminate or mitigate risks associated with the proposed well work.
 
· Identify functional safety links and roles/responsibilities between Operator and Contractor to allow safe execution of the proposed well Work.
 
· Communicate critical information about the Operators well construction execution plans to the Contractor.
 
· Address areas of the safety management process, including specialized areas such as management of change, well control, fire and explosion management, lifting equipment, dropped objects, permit to work, helicopter operations and incident database guidelines.
 
· Address all phases of the well construction process within the context of the proposed well work  drilling, suspension, completion, testing, workover and/or abandonment.
 
· Develop a WCID guideline that is easy to use and understand, yet robust and complete in detail.
