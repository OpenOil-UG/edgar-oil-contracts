If any Guarantor fails to pay any sum payable by it under this Deed on the due date for payment of that sum, the Guarantor shall, without double counting, pay interest on such sum at the rate and in accordance with Clause 9.3 (Default Interest) of the Facility Agreement.
 
3.                                     GUARANTEE AND INDEMNITY
 
3.1                              Guarantee and indemnity

(B)                               undertakes with each Beneficiary that whenever a Borrower does not pay any amount when due under or in connection with any Finance Document, that Guarantor shall immediately on demand pay that amount as if it was the principal obligor; and
 
(C)                               indemnifies each Beneficiary immediately on demand against any cost, loss or liability suffered by that Beneficiary if any obligation guaranteed by it is or becomes unenforceable, invalid or illegal.  The amount of the cost, loss or liability shall be equal to the amount which that Beneficiary would otherwise have been entitled to recover.
 
For the avoidance of doubt, Clause 3.1(B) (Guarantee and indemnity) of this Deed shall become immediately enforceable and the Beneficiaries shall be entitled, without notice to the Guarantors or prior authorisation from any court, to claim payment from the Guarantors under Clause 3.1 (Guarantee and indemnity) of this Deed.
 
3.2                              Continuing guarantee
 
This guarantee is a continuing guarantee and will extend to the ultimate balance of sums payable by any Obligor under the Finance Documents, regardless of any intermediate payment or discharge in whole or in part.
 








 
3.3                              Reinstatement
 
If any payment by an Obligor or any discharge given by a Beneficiary (whether in respect of the obligations of any Obligor or any security for those obligations or otherwise) is avoided or reduced as a result of insolvency or any similar event:
 
(A)                               the liability of each Obligor shall continue as if the payment, discharge, avoidance or reduction had not occurred; and
 
(B)                               each Beneficiary shall be entitled to recover the value or amount of that security or payment from each Obligor, as if the payment, discharge, avoidance or reduction had not occurred.
 
3.4                              Waiver of defences
 
The obligations of each Guarantor under this Clause 3 will not be affected by an act, omission, matter or thing which, but for this clause, would reduce, release or prejudice any of its obligations under this Clause 3 (without limitation and whether or not known to it or any Beneficiary) including:
 
(A)                               any time, waiver or consent granted to, or composition with, any Obligor or other person;
 
(B)                               the release of any other Obligor or any other person under the terms of any composition or arrangement with any creditor of any member of the Group;
 
(C)                               the taking, variation, compromise, exchange, renewal or release of, or refusal or neglect to perfect, take up or enforce, any rights against, or security over assets of, any Obligor or other person or any non-presentation or non-observance of any formality or other requirement in respect of any instrument or any failure to realise the full value of any security;
 
(D)                               any incapacity or lack of power, authority or legal personality or dissolution or change in the members or status of an Obligor or any other person;
 
(E)                                any amendment, novation, supplement, extension, restatement (however fundamental and whether or not more onerous) or replacement of any Finance Document or any other document or security including without limitation any change in the purpose of, any extension of or any increase in any facility or the addition of any new facility under any Finance Document or other document or security;
 
(F)                                 any amalgamation, merger or reconstruction that may be effected by the Security and Intercreditor Agent or any Beneficiary with any other person, including any reconstruction by the Security and Intercreditor Agent or any Beneficiary involving the formation of a new company and the transfer of all or any of their assets to that company, or any sale or transfer of the whole or any part of the undertaking and assets of the Security and Intercreditor Agent or any Beneficiary to any other person;
 
(G)                               any unenforceability, illegality or invalidity of any obligation of any person under any Finance Document or any other document or security; or
 








 
(H)                              any insolvency or similar proceedings.
 
3.5                              Immediate recourse
 
Each Guarantor waives any right it may have of first requiring any Beneficiary to proceed against or enforce any other rights or security or claim payment from any person before claiming from that Guarantor under this Clause 3.  This waiver applies irrespective of any law or any provision of a Finance Document to the contrary.
 
3.6                              Appropriations
 
Until all amounts which may be or become payable by the Obligors under or in connection with the Finance Documents have been irrevocably paid in full, each Beneficiary (or any trustee or agent on its behalf) may:
 
(A)                               refrain from applying or enforcing any other moneys, security or rights held or received by that Beneficiary (or any trustee or agent on its behalf) in respect of those amounts, or apply and enforce the same in such manner and order as it sees fit (whether against those amounts or otherwise) and no Guarantor shall be entitled to the benefit of the same; and
 
(B)                               hold in an interest-bearing suspense account any moneys received from any Guarantor or on account of any Guarantors liability under this Deed.
 
3.7                              Deferral of Guarantors rights
 
(A)                               Until all amounts which may be or become payable by the Obligors under or in connection with the Finance Documents have been irrevocably paid in full and unless the Security and Intercreditor Agent otherwise directs, no Guarantor will exercise any rights which it may have by reason of performance by it of its obligations under the Finance Documents:
 
(i)                                    to be indemnified by an Obligor;
 
(ii)                                 to claim any contribution from any other guarantor of any Obligors obligations under the Finance Documents;
 
(iii)                              to take the benefit (in whole or in part and whether by way of subrogation or otherwise) of any rights of the Beneficiaries under the Finance Documents or of any other guarantee or security taken pursuant to, or in connection with, the Finance Documents by any Beneficiary;
 
(iv)                             to bring legal or other proceedings for an order requiring any Obligor to make any payment, or perform any obligation, in respect of which any Guarantor has given a guarantee, undertaking or indemnity under this Deed;
 
(v)                                to exercise any right of set-off against any Obligor; and/or
 
(vi)                             to claim or prove as a creditor of any Obligor in competition with any Finance Party.
 







 
(B)                               If a Guarantor receives any benefit, payment or distribution in relation to such rights it shall hold that benefit, payment or distribution to the extent necessary to enable all amounts which may be or become payable to the Beneficiaries by the Obligors under or in connection with the Finance Documents to be repaid in full on trust for the Beneficiaries and shall promptly pay or transfer the same to the Security and Intercreditor Agent or as it may direct for application in accordance with Clause 28 (PAYMENT MECHANICS) of the Facility Agreement or, if the HY Noteholder Trustee has acceded to this Deed pursuant to Clause 8 (ACCESSION OF HY NOTEHOLDER TRUSTEE), in accordance with the ranking priorities under the KEL Intercreditor Agreement.
 
3.8                              Release of Guarantors right of contribution
 
If any Guarantor ceases to be a Guarantor (a Retiring Guarantor) in accordance with the terms of the Finance Documents or Clause 6 (RELEASE) of this Deed, then on the date such Retiring Guarantor ceases to be a Guarantor:
 
(A)                               that Retiring Guarantor is released by each other Guarantor from any liability (whether past, present or future and whether actual or contingent) to make a contribution to any other Guarantor arising by reason of the performance by any other Guarantor of its obligations under the Finance Documents; and
 
(B)                               each other Guarantor waives any rights it may have by reason of the performance of its obligations under the Finance Documents to take the benefit (in whole or in part and whether by way of subrogation or otherwise) of any rights of the Beneficiaries under any Finance Document or of any other security taken pursuant to, or in connection with, any Finance Document where such rights or security are granted by or in relation to the assets of the Retiring Guarantor.
 
3.9                              Additional security
 
This Deed is in addition to and is not in any way prejudiced by any other guarantee or security now or subsequently held by any Beneficiary.
 
3.10                       Further advances
 
The Guarantors guarantee the obligations and liabilities of each Borrower to the Finance Parties in respect of all further advances under the Facility Agreement or HY Notes issuance under the HY Note Indenture.
 
3.11                       No prejudice
 
The guarantee and indemnity created by or pursuant to this Deed shall not be prejudiced by any unenforceability or invalidity of any other agreement or document or by any time or indulgence granted to the Guarantors, the Security and Intercreditor Agent or the Beneficiaries or by any other thing which might otherwise prejudice that guarantee and indemnity.
 






 
4.                                     SUBORDINATION
 
(A)                               Each of the Beneficiaries, the Security and Intercreditor Agent, the HY Noteholder Trustee (to the extent it is a party to this Deed), the Guarantors and the Borrower agree that the rights and benefits of the Beneficiaries to make any claim or demand or to take any action against the Subordinating Guarantors or to enforce the guarantee and indemnity pursuant to the terms of this Deed, shall be expressly subordinated to the Security Interests of any lender providing Project Finance to a Subordinating Guarantor, including any such Project Finance arising after the date of this Deed.
 
(B)                               In the event that any Subordinating Guarantor raises or wishes to raise Project Finance, then the Security and Intercreditor Agent will, on behalf of itself and on behalf of each Beneficiary, promptly, upon written request by the Company, enter into a Deed of Subordination subordinating the interests of the Beneficiaries hereunder to the interests of the providers of such Project Finance.
 
5.                                     RIGHTS OF THE BENEFICIARIES
 
5.1                              The KEFI Intercreditor Agreement
 
As between the Beneficiaries, the Security and Intercreditor Agent undertakes on behalf of itself and each Beneficiary in favour of the RBL Security Agent that the rights under this Deed may only be enforced at the times and subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the KEFI Intercreditor Agreement.
 
5.2                              No Rights for any Guarantor
 
No Guarantor shall have any rights, whether express or implied, under this Clause 5.
 
6.                                     RELEASE
 
If:
 
(A)                               each Borrowers obligations under the Finance Documents have been unconditionally and irrevocably paid or discharged in full and none of the Beneficiaries has any further liability or obligation to advance any funds under the Finance Documents; or
 
(B)                               security or a guarantee for each Borrowers obligations under the Finance Documents, in either case, acceptable to the Security and Intercreditor Agent, has been provided in substitution for this Deed; or
 
(C)                               a Guarantor is unconditionally entitled pursuant to any provision of the Finance Documents to be released from its liabilities,
 
the Security and Intercreditor Agent shall, subject to Clause 3.3 (Reinstatement), release the Guarantor or Guarantors from the liabilities under this Deed.
 






 
7.                                     ADDITIONAL GUARANTOR
 
Any person that becomes an Additional Guarantor pursuant to the provisions of Clause 23.4 (Additional Guarantor) of the Facility Agreement, shall deliver to the Security and Intercreditor Agent an Accession Deed duly completed and executed by that Additional Guarantor.
 
8.                                     ACCESSION OF HY NOTEHOLDER TRUSTEE
 
(A)                               Each party to this Deed agrees that any collateral agent, trustee or other representative of the HY Noteholders may enter into and accede to this Deed as a Beneficiary for and on behalf of itself and each HY Noteholder without the requirement for any consent or approvals from any party to this Deed from time to time. Such accession shall confer upon the HY Noteholders all of the rights and privileges set out in this Deed.  The Company may by five Business Days written notice (the Amendment Notice Period) to the Security and Intercreditor Agent request that such amendments and/or additions be made to this Deed as any collateral agent, trustee or other representative of the HY Noteholders (whether appointed at that time or not) may reasonably require(the HY Noteholder Trustee Amendments). During the Amendment Notice Period, either:
 
(i)                                    the Security and Intercreditor Agent shall enter into any agreement effecting the HY Noteholder Trustee Amendments, on the instructions of the Majority Lenders; or
 
(ii)                                 the Facility Agent shall notify the Company in writing of any determination by the Majority Lenders that the HY Noteholder Trustee Amendments would materially and adversely prejudice their interests.
 
(B)                               If, on the instructions of the Majority Lenders, the Facility Agent is required to make the notification described in paragraph (A)(ii) above, the Facility Agent shall promptly contact the Company in writing, setting out in reasonable detail the basis and reasons for that decision and the changes which the Majority Lenders (acting reasonably) would require for the Security and Intercreditor Agent to enter into the revised version of this Deed with the HY Noteholder Trustee Amendments incorporated.  If such changes are made, then the Security and Intercreditor Agent will be deemed to have been instructed by the Majority Lenders promptly to enter into any agreement effecting the HY Noteholder Amendments, together with the changes required by the Majority Lenders.
 
(C)                               For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not issue any HY Notes unless on or prior to such issuance, the HY Noteholder Trustee enters into the KEL Intercreditor Agreement (as amended pursuant to this clause).
 
9.                                     SUSPENSE ACCOUNT
 
The Security and Intercreditor Agent may, at its sole discretion, place and retain on a suspense account, for as long as it considers fit, any monies received, recovered or realised under or in connection with this Deed to the extent of the Guaranteed
 






 
Obligations, without any obligation on the part of the Security and Intercreditor Agent to apply them in or towards the discharge of such Guaranteed Obligations.
 
10.                              NEW ACCOUNT
 
At any time after:
 
(A)                               any Beneficiary receives, or is deemed to be affected by, notice (either actual or constructive) of any subsequent Security Interest or any disposition affecting the Guaranteed Obligations or part thereof; or
 
(B)                               any corporate, legal proceeding or other procedure or step taken for or with a view to the rehabilitation, administration, custodianship, receivership, liquidation, winding-up or dissolution of any Guarantor,
 
any Beneficiary may open a new account in the name of a Guarantor (whether or not it permits any existing account to continue).  If the Beneficiary does not open such a new account, it shall nevertheless be treated as if it had done so at the time when the notice was received or was deemed to have been received or, as the case may be, the corporate, legal proceeding or other procedure or step was taken.  As from that time, all payments made by the Guarantors to the Security and Intercreditor Agent or any other Beneficiary or received by the Security and Intercreditor or any other Beneficiary for the account of any Obligor or any Beneficiary shall be credited or treated as having been credited to the new account and will not operate to reduce the amount secured by this Deed at any time.

11.2                       Other rights

11.3                       Other rights of the Beneficiaries

Deed except through the Security and Intercreditor Agent.  The Security and Intercreditor Agent shall take such action (including but not limited to the exercise of all rights, powers and discretions and the grants of all consents or releases) or refrain from taking action pursuant to this Deed as it may be instructed in writing by the Beneficiaries.  The Guarantors shall not be concerned with whether the Security and Intercreditor Agent shall be acting in accordance with any instructions from the Beneficiaries and shall be conclusively entitled to assume that the Security and Intercreditor Agent has all the necessary right, title and authority.
 
12.                              INDEMNITY

(B)                               No payment to the Security and Intercreditor Agent (whether under any judgment or court order or otherwise) shall discharge the obligation or liability of the Guarantors in respect of which it was made unless and until the Security and Intercreditor Agent shall have received payment in full in the currency in which such obligation or liability was incurred and to the extent that the amount of any such payment shall on actual conversion into such currency fall short of such obligation or liability actual or contingent expressed in that currency the Security and Intercreditor Agent shall have a further separate cause of action against the Guarantors, and the Guarantors shall, as an original and independent obligation under this Deed, indemnify within five Business Days of demand, the Security and Intercreditor Agent against the amount of any such shortfall.
 
(C)                               The obligations contained in this Clause 12 shall survive the expiration of this Deed.

15.2                       Assignment by the Guarantors
 
The rights, interests and obligations of the Guarantors under this Deed are personal to each Guarantor.  Accordingly, they are not capable of being assigned, transferred or delegated in any manner.  Each Guarantor undertakes that it shall not at any time assign or transfer, or attempt to assign, transfer, delegate or create any trust over any of its rights, interests or obligations under or in respect of this Deed.

(B)                               The Security and Intercreditor Agent shall be entitled to disclose such information concerning the Guarantors and this Deed to any actual or proposed direct or indirect successor where such person to whom the information is to be given has entered into a Confidentiality Undertaking or as the Security and Intercreditor Agent may be required to be disclosed by any applicable law.

(ii)                                 the legality, validity or enforceability under the law of any other jurisdiction of that or any other provision of this Deed,
 
and the parties shall enter into good faith negotiations (but without any liability whatsoever in the event of no agreement being reached) to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision with a view to obtaining the same commercial effect as this Deed would have had if such provision had been legal, valid and enforceable.
 
(B)                               To the extent that any Guarantor may be entitled to claim or invoke any defence, or benefit from any claim or defence, that this Deed or any other
 






 
Finance Document or any provision of this Deed or any other Finance Document is illegal, invalid, unenforceable or void under or contrary to any law in the Cayman Islands or Ghana, each Guarantor expressly, unconditionally and irrevocably agrees not to make such a claim or invoke such a defence or permit such a claim or defence to be raised or invoked on its behalf.
