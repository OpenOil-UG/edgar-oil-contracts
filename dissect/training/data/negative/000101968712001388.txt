FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, Mid-East Oil Company, a Pennsylvania corporation (the “Debtor”), HEREBY UNCONDITIONALLY PROMISES TO PAY to the order of Vadda Energy Corporation (“Secured Party”), for its benefit, in lawful money of the United States of America the principal sum of THREE MILLION U.S. DOLLARS (U.S. $3,000,000.00), such amount representing the original aggregate principal amount of the term loan evidenced hereby (the “Loan”) owed by the Debtor to the Secured Party pursuant to this Secured Promissory Note (the “Promissory Note”).




The Debtor promises to pay all principal due hereunder in one (1) installment payable on December 31, 2011 (the “Maturity Date”). The Debtor promises to pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of the Loan from the date hereof until such principal amount is paid in full, and interest shall be due and payable on the Maturity Date. Interest shall be computed on the basis of a 365-day year for the actual number of days elapsed at a per annum rate equal to one percent (1%). From and after the occurrence of an “Event of Default” (as defined below), interest shall accrue on all unpaid principal and on any other amounts due hereunder, at a rate per annum equal to the lesser of (i) the maximum permissible amount under applicable usury laws and (ii) the rate otherwise applicable hereunder plus fourteen percent (14%) per annum.




The indebtedness evidenced hereby may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time and from time to time without premium or penalty.




As security for the payment in full of all of the Debtor’s obligations under this Promissory Note (and any extension, renewal, refinancing, reissuance, amendment and restatement, refunding or other modification thereof), the Debtor hereby pledges and assigns to the Secured Party, and grants to the Secured Party a continuing lien on and security interest in, all of the Debtor’s right, title and interest in, to and under all of the Debtor’s assets, whether now owned or existing or hereafter arising or acquired and wheresoever located, together with all products and proceeds of the foregoing (the “Collateral”) as provided in that certain Security Agreement executed in connection herewith of even date. The Secured Party shall have, in addition to the rights and remedies contained herein or in any other instruments, documents or other agreements heretofore, now or hereafter executed by the Debtor and delivered to the Secured Party (all such documents, collectively, as amended and in effect from time to time, the “Loan Documents”), all of the rights and remedies of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code of Texas, or other applicable law, all of which rights and remedies shall be cumulative, and none exclusive, to the extent permitted by law.




All payments of principal and interest in respect of the Loan shall be made payable to the Secured Party in lawful money of the United States of America for the Secured Party’s account at 1660 Stemmons Freeway, Suite 440, Lewisville, Texas 75067, or such other place as shall be designated by the Secured Party for such purpose.

Should the indebtedness represented by this Promissory Note or any part hereof be collected at law or in equity or in bankruptcy, receivership or other court proceeding, or should this Promissory Note be placed in the hands of attorneys for collection after default, the Debtor agrees to pay, in addition to the principal, interest due and payable hereon and any other sums due and payable hereon, all costs of collecting or attempting to collect this Promissory Note, including attorneys’ fees and expenses (including those incurred in connection with any appeal).

If any excess interest or late payment charge in such respect is provided for under this Promissory Note or shall be adjudicated to provide for such terms, neither the Debtor nor its successors or assigns shall be obligated to pay such interest or late payment charge in excess of the maximum amount permitted by law, and the right to demand the payment of any such excess shall be and hereby is waived. In the event the Secured Party shall collect monies that are deemed to constitute interest which would increase the effective interest rate to a rate in excess of the maximum rate permitted by law, all such sums deemed to constitute interest in excess of the maximum rate permitted by law shall, upon such determination, at the option of the Secured Party, be returned to the Debtor or credited against the principal balance of the Debtor’s obligation then outstanding under this Promissory Note. This provision shall control any other provision of this Promissory Note.




Upon the occurrence of any of the following events (each an “Event of Default”): (i) the Debtor shall fail to pay the principal of the Loan, interest on the Loan or any other amount due hereunder when due; (ii) if any representation or warranty made by the Debtor herein or in any other Loan Document shall be false or misleading in any material respect when made or deemed made; (iii) if the Debtor shall fail to perform or observe any other term or condition binding upon it hereunder or under any other Loan Document and such failure shall continue unremedied for a period of ten (10) days after written notice thereof from the Secured Party; (iv) any event shall have occurred that permits any holder of the Debtor’s other obligations or indebtedness to accelerate the maturity thereof or the Debtor fails to pay when due any such obligations or indebtedness; or (v) (a) if the Debtor or any guarantor shall generally not pay its debts as such debts become due or shall make a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, (b) if any proceeding shall be instituted by or, unless dismissed within thirty (30) days, against, the Debtor or any guarantor seeking to adjudicate it a bankrupt or insolvent or seeking liquidation, winding up, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, protection, relief or composition of it or its debts under any law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or relief of debtors generally, or seeking the entry of an order for relief or for the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian or other similar officer for it or for any part of its assets, or (c) if the Debtor or any guarantor shall take any action to authorize any of the actions set forth in subclauses (v)(a) and (v)(b) of this paragraph; then the Secured Party may, without demand, notice or legal process of any kind, declare the outstanding principal amount of the Loan together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon and all other amounts due hereunder (collectively, the “Indebtedness”) to be, whereupon the Indebtedness shall become, immediately due and payable; provided, however, that upon the occurrence of any Event of Default specified in subclause (v) of this paragraph, the Indebtedness shall automatically become due and payable.

GUARANTY AGREEMENT

 




This Guaranty Agreement (this “Guaranty”), dated as of December 30th, 2011, is made and entered into by Mark A. Thompson, individually, (“Guarantor”), in favor of Vadda Energy Corporation (the “Lender”).  Each capitalized and other term used and not defined herein shall have the meaning assigned to such term in the Note (as defined below) or, if not defined in the Note, that certain Security Agreement of even date herewith between Mid-East Oil Company, a Pennsylvania corporation (“Company”), and the Lender.




W I T N E S S E T H:

 

WHEREAS, the Company is indebted to the Lender in the principal amount of $3,000,000.00 (the “Debt”) evidenced by that certain Secured Promissory Note (such note together with any and all renewals, extensions, and/or rearrangements thereof is herein called the “Note”) dated of even date herewith in the principal amount of the Debt executed by the Company and payable to the order of the Lender;




WHEREAS, Guarantor is an executive officer of the Company; and




WHEREAS, the guaranties provided in this Guaranty reasonably may be expected to benefit, directly or indirectly, Guarantor, and it is in the best interest of Guarantor to provide the guaranties hereunder, and such guaranties are necessary or convenient to the conduct, promotion or attainment of the business of Guarantor;




NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the Lender extending credit to Company represented by the Note, Guarantor hereby covenants and agrees as follows:




1.           GUARANTY.  Guarantor hereby irrevocably, absolutely, and unconditionally guarantees to the Lender, its successors and permitted assigns the timely payment when due, subject to any applicable grace period, of all present and future payment obligations of the Company now existing or hereafter arising under the Note or any other Loan Document (as defined in the Note) (collectively, the “Obligations”).  To the extent that the Company shall fail to pay any Obligations owing by the Company when due, Guarantor shall pay to the Lender such Obligations when due.  This Guaranty shall constitute a guarantee of payment and not of collection.  Guarantor’s liability hereunder shall be and is specifically limited to payments arising under the Note and/or the other Loan Documents.

 

2.           NATURE OF GUARANTY; SETOFFS AND COUNTERCLAIMS.  Guarantor’s obligations hereunder shall not be affected by the existence, validity, enforceability, perfection or extent of any collateral therefor or by any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge of or defense to a guaranty (except as otherwise provided in the last sentence of this Section).  The Lender shall not be obligated to file any claim relating to the Obligations in the event that the Company becomes subject to a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, and the failure of the Lender to so file shall not affect Guarantor’s obligations hereunder.

3.           AMENDMENT OF GUARANTY.  No term or provision of this Guaranty shall be amended, modified, altered, waived, or supplemented except in a writing signed by Guarantor and the Lender.

 

4.           WAIVERS.  Guarantor hereby waives (a) notice of acceptance of this Guaranty; (b) promptness, diligence, presentment, demand of payment and all other notices concerning the liabilities of Guarantor; and (c) any right to require that any action or proceeding be brought against the Company or any other person or entity, or to require that the Lender seek enforcement of any performance against the Company or any other person or entity, prior to any action against Guarantor under the terms hereof.

 

Guarantor agrees that the Lender may resort to Guarantor for payment of any of the Obligations, whether or not the Lender shall have resorted to any collateral security or shall have proceeded against the Company or any other obligor principally or secondarily obligated with respect to any of the Obligations.




No delay of the Lender in the exercise of, or failure to exercise, any rights hereunder shall operate as a waiver of such rights, a waiver of any other rights or a release of Guarantor from any Obligations hereunder, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder preclude any subsequent or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.  Each and every right, remedy and power hereby granted to the Lender or allowed him by law or other agreement shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other, and may be exercised by the Lender from time to time.




Guarantor consents to the renewal, compromise, extension, acceleration or other changes in the time of payment of or other changes in the terms of the Obligations, or any part thereof or any changes or modifications to the terms of the Note and/or any other Loan Document, and agrees that none of the foregoing actions or events shall in any way impair or affect Guarantor’s obligations hereunder.




5.           NOTICE.  Any notice, request, instruction, correspondence or other document to be given hereunder by any party to another (herein collectively called “Notice”) shall be in writing and delivered personally or mailed by certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested, or by telecopier, as follows:
