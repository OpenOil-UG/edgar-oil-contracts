Amegy, BP, Shell and all additional Approved Hedge Counterparties agree that each Exempt LC and any proceeds thereof are exempt from the requirements of Section 2(c) hereof; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 5(b) is to be construed to permit Borrower to enter into Commodity Hedge Agreements except as permitted under the Credit Agreement.(c)    If a Triggering Event shall have occurred and is continuing, subject to the applicability of any Blocking Period, all Proceeds received by Collateral Agent shall be applied in the following order:(i)    First, to reimburse Collateral Agent for expenses in accordance with Section 6 below;(ii)    Second, Ratably to Secured Creditors (or, with respect to payment of the Loan Obligations, to Agent on behalf of itself, Lenders and any Credit Agreement Approved Hedge Counterparties), respectively, for application against the Loan Obligations (other than the Specified Loan Obligations) and the Approved Hedge Counterparty Obligations; (iii)    Third, Ratably to Secured Creditors (other than the Approved Hedge Counterparties) or to Agent on behalf of such Secured Creditors in satisfaction of the Specified Loan Obligations and any other indebtedness of Borrower, other than the Loan Obligations or the Approved Hedge Counterparty Obligations, secured by the Security Instruments; and(iv)    Fourth, to the extent that any Proceeds remain after the full payment of all of the amounts described in the immediately preceding clauses (i) through (iii), to Borrower or any of Guarantors, as the case may be.(d)    Any amount otherwise payable to Agent, any Lender or any Credit Agreement Approved Hedge Counterparty pursuant to clause (c)(ii) or (c)(iii) of this Section 5 shall instead by paid to Agent for distribution in accordance with Section 7.2(e) of the Credit Agreement.6.    Expenses.  Each Secured Creditor shall bear its Ratable share of any reasonable and documented expenses incurred by Collateral Agent in taking action on behalf of Secured Creditors in connection with its investigation, evaluation or enforcement of any Rights under the Security Instruments, but only to the extent Collateral Agent does not receive reimbursement for such expenses from any other source(s) (excluding Secured Creditors) within a reasonable time after such expenses are incurred; provided that, to the extent any Secured Creditor reimburses Collateral Agent for such expenses, such Secured Creditor will be entitled to receive its Ratable share of any reimbursement subsequently received by Collateral Agent from any other source(s) (excluding Secured Creditors).7.    Limitation of Liability – Collateral Agent.  Neither Collateral Agent nor any of its representatives shall be liable to any Secured Creditor for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them hereunder or under the Security Instruments in good faith and reasonably believed by it or them to be within the discretion or power conferred upon it or them by this Agreement and the Security Instruments or be responsible for the consequences of any error of judgment, except to the extent arising solely from its bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct.  Collateral Agent - 13 -shall not be responsible in any manner to any other party for the effectiveness, enforceability, genuineness, validity or the due execution of the Security Instruments or for any representation, warranty, document, certificate, report or statement made in or in connection with the Security Instruments or be under any obligation to any other party to ascertain or inquire as to the performance or observation of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of any of the Loan Documents or the Approved Hedge Agreements on the part of Borrower or any Guarantor.  EACH OF AGENT (ON BEHALF OF ITSELF, LENDERS AND CREDIT AGREEMENT APPROVED HEDGE COUNTERPARTIES RATABLY ON THE BASIS OF THE LOAN OBLIGATIONS OWED TO EACH) AND APPROVED HEDGE COUNTERPARTIES AGREES TO RATABLY INDEMNIFY COLLATERAL AGENT AND HOLD IT HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL LIABILITIES, OBLIGATIONS, LOSSES, DAMAGES, PENALTIES, ACTIONS, JUDGMENTS, SUITS, COSTS, REASONABLE EXPENSES AND/OR REASONABLE DISBURSEMENTS OF ANY KIND OR NATURE WHATSOEVER WHICH MAY BE IMPOSED ON, ASSERTED AGAINST OR INCURRED BY COLLATERAL AGENT IN ANY WAY RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF THE SECURITY INSTRUMENTS OR ANY ACTION TAKEN OR OMITTED BY COLLATERAL AGENT UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SECURITY INSTRUMENTS, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT ANY OF THE SAME RESULTS SOLELY FROM THE BAD FAITH, GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF COLLATERAL AGENT.  Collateral Agent shall give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party or parties (provided that later notice shall not relieve indemnifying party(ies) of its liability and obligations under this Section 7 unless and to the extent the indemnifying party(ies) is/are prejudiced by such notice not being promptly provided) after any applicable claim is initiated against Collateral Agent and allow the indemnifying party(ies) to have sole control and authority of the defense and settlement of the claim; provided that Collateral Agent shall approve any settlement of a claim to which Collateral Agent is an actual party or could reasonably be expected to be a potential party and in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, so long as such settlement (a) includes an unconditional release of Collateral Agent from all liability in any way related to or arising out of such claim and (b) does not impose any actual or potential liability upon, or contain any factual or legal admission by or with respect to, Collateral Agent.  Collateral Agent shall reasonably cooperate with the indemnifying party(ies) in the defense of such claims, including, but not limited to, providing reasonable assistance and information at the indemnifying party’s(ies’) expense.8.    Limitation of Liability – Agent and Approved Hedge Counterparties.  Neither any Approved Hedge Counterparty, Collateral Agent nor Agent (nor any individual partner, member, director, employee or agent of any Approved Hedge Counterparty or Agent) shall incur any liability under this Agreement to the others except for liabilities arising from its gross negligence or willful misconduct.  Neither any Secured Creditor nor Collateral Agent (nor any individual partner, member, director, employee or agent of any Secured Creditor or Collateral Agent) shall incur any liability under this Agreement to Borrower, any Guarantor or any other Person except for liabilities arising from its bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct or its non-performance of this Agreement, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.- 14 -9.    Term.  Subject to Section 22 below, this Agreement shall terminate upon (a) the full and indefeasible payment of the Loan Obligations (other than contingent Loan Obligations with respect to which no claim has been made) and the Approved Hedge Counterparty Obligations (other than contingent Approved Hedge Counterparty Obligations with respect to which no claim has been made) and (b) the execution and delivery of a written termination notice signed by each of the parties hereto as of such termination.10.    Resignation or Removal of Collateral Agent.(a)    Should all of the Loan Obligations (other than contingent Loan Obligations with respect to which no claim has been made) be fully and indefeasibly paid or satisfied at a point in time when any Approved Hedge Counterparty Obligation (other than contingent Approved Hedge Counterparty Obligations with respect to which no claim has been made) remains outstanding, Amegy may resign as Collateral Agent hereunder by providing to each Approved Hedge Counterparty and Borrower written notice of such resignation no less than 30 days prior to the effective date of such resignation set forth in such written notice.  Upon such resignation by Collateral Agent, Collateral Agent agrees to execute and deliver assignments, in form and substance mutually satisfactory to Agent and all Approved Hedge Counterparties, to a successor Collateral Agent designated by Approved Hedge Counterparties and, so long as no Potential Event of Default, Event of Default or Termination Event (as each such term is defined in the BP ISDA, the Shell ISDA or any other ISDA Master Agreement or schedule thereto between Borrower and any other Approved Hedge Counterparty, as applicable) exists under the BP ISDA, the Shell ISDA or any such other ISDA Master Agreement between Borrower and any other Approved Hedge Counterparty, approved by Borrower (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), of the rights of the mortgagee, the secured party or the grantee, as the case may be, under the Security Instruments.  Such assignments shall be prepared at the expense of Borrower, provided that such expense is documented and reasonable.  Following such resignation by Collateral Agent and execution and delivery of such assignments, Collateral Agent shall have no further duties, responsibilities or liabilities under this Agreement, but shall remain entitled to the benefit of the indemnification of Collateral Agent provided in this Agreement and to reimbursement, in accordance with applicable provisions of this Agreement, of expenses incurred in the discharge of the duties of Collateral Agent prior to the effective date of such resignation.(b)    If Collateral Agent fails to take any material action under the Security Instruments to protect or realize upon the Collateral following a Triggering Event as required under Section 4.1(a) above within a reasonable time after being requested to do so in writing by an Approved Hedge Counterparty or Collateral Agent materially breaches its obligations to diligently pursue such action as required under this Agreement, then such Approved Hedge Counterparty may petition a court of competent jurisdiction to replace Collateral Agent with another Person, which may be an Approved Hedge Counterparty.  Such replacement Collateral Agent may take such other actions as it may deem necessary or advisable to secure and enforce the Security Instruments.  In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction shall decide to replace Collateral Agent, any successor Collateral Agent shall be required to apply all proceeds of any realization upon the Collateral in accordance with Section 5(c) above, provided that any reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the - 15 -replacement of Collateral Agent may be paid to the Person incurring such expenses from proceeds of the Collateral pursuant to Section 5(c)(i) above.11.    Survival of Rights.  All of the respective rights and interests of Agent, Approved Hedge Counterparties and Collateral Agent under this Agreement (and the respective obligations and agreements of Agent, Approved Hedge Counterparties and Collateral Agent under this Agreement), shall remain in full force and effect regardless of:(a)    any lack of validity or enforceability of any of the Loan Documents or the Approved Hedge Agreements or any other agreement or instrument related thereto; or(b)    any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or discharge of, Borrower or any Guarantor with respect to the Loan Obligations or the Approved Hedge Counterparty Obligations (other than the (i) defense that such obligations have been fully satisfied and (ii) termination of this Agreement in accordance with Sections 9 and 22 hereof).12.    Representations and Warranties.  Each of Agent, Approved Hedge Counterparties, Borrower and Collateral Agent represents and warrants to the other parties hereto that:(a)    neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor its performance of or compliance with the terms and provisions hereof will conflict with, or result in a breach of the terms, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any other agreement to which it is now subject, including, but not limited to, any of the Loan Documents or the Approved Hedge Agreements;(b)    it has all requisite authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement; and(c)    this Agreement constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject only to applicable Debtor Relief Laws and general principles of equity.13.    Further Assurances.  Each of Agent, Approved Hedge Counterparties, Borrower, Guarantors and Collateral Agent covenants that, as long as this Agreement remains in effect, it will execute and deliver any and all other documents or instruments reasonably requested by any other party hereto to give effect to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Security Instruments.14.    Assignment; Agreement Binding on Successors and Assigns.  As long as this Agreement remains in effect, neither Agent, any Lender, any Credit Agreement Approved Hedge Counterparty nor any Approved Hedge Counterparty will sell, assign or otherwise transfer all or any part of the Loan Obligations or the Approved Hedge Counterparty Obligations, as the case may be, owing to it unless such sale, assignment or transfer is made expressly subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and shall be binding upon and enforceable against, Borrower, Guarantors, Agent, Lenders, each Credit Agreement Approved Hedge Counterparty, each Approved Hedge Counterparty and Collateral Agent and their respective successors and permitted assigns.- 16 -15.    Notice.

THIS AGREEMENT MUST BE CONSTRUED, AND ITS PERFORMANCE ENFORCED, UNDER TEXAS LAW, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE LAWS OF TEXAS AS TO CONFLICTS OF LAWS.18.    Invalid Provisions.  If any part of this Agreement is for any reason found to be unenforceable, all other portions nevertheless remain enforceable. However, if the provision held to be unenforceable is a material part of the Agreement, such unenforceable provision may, to the extent permitted by law, be replaced by a clause or provision judicially construed and interpreted to be as similar in substance and content to the original terms of such provision as the context would reasonably allow, so that such clause or provision would thereafter be enforceable.19.    Multiple Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts with the same effect as if all signatories had signed the same document and will be effective upon the execution of one or more counterparts hereof by each of the parties hereto.  Delivery of an executed signature page of this Agreement by facsimile or other electronic means shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart thereof.  In this regard, each of the parties hereto acknowledges that a counterpart of this Agreement containing a set of counterpart execution pages reflecting the execution of each party hereto shall be sufficient to reflect the execution of this Agreement by each party hereto.  All counterparts will, taken together, constitute - 18 -one and the same instrument.  Delivery of an executed signature page of this Agreement by facsimile transmission or other electronic means shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart hereof.20.    Dispute Resolution.  THIS SECTION 20 CONTAINS A JURY WAIVER, A CLASS ACTION WAIVER AND AN ARBITRATION PROVISION.  READ CAREFULLY.(a)    This dispute resolution provision shall supersede and replace any prior “Jury Waiver,” “Judicial Reference,” “Class Action Waiver,” “Arbitration,” “Dispute Resolution” or similar alternative dispute agreement or provision between or among the parties hereto.(b)    As permitted by applicable law, each party hereto hereby knowingly, voluntarily, intentionally, irrevocably and unconditionally WAIVES ITS RIGHTS TO A TRIAL BEFORE A JURY IN CONNECTION WITH ANY CLAIM, DISPUTE OR CONTROVERSY WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT (each of the foregoing, a “Dispute”), and, except as provided below in this Section 20, DISPUTES, SHALL BE RESOLVED BY A JUDGE SITTING WITHOUT A JURY.  If a court determines that this provision is not enforceable for any reason and at any time prior to trial of the Dispute, but not later than 30 days after entry of the order determining this provision is unenforceable, any party hereto shall be entitled to move the court for an order compelling arbitration and staying or dismissing such litigation pending arbitration (an “Arbitration Order”).  If permitted by applicable law, EACH PARTY ALSO WAIVES THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE IN COURT OR AN ARBITRATION PROCEEDING ANY DISPUTE AS A CLASS ACTION, EITHER AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS OR AS A REPRESENTATIVE, OR TO ACT AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL.(c)    If a Dispute arises, and only if a jury trial waiver is not permitted by applicable law or ruling by a court, any party may require that the Dispute be resolved by binding arbitration before a single arbitrator.  BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATE A DISPUTE, EACH PARTY HERETO GIVES UP ANY RIGHT THAT PARTY MAY HAVE TO A JURY TRIAL AS WELL AS OTHER RIGHTS THAT IT WOULD HAVE IN COURT THAT ARE NOT AVAILABLE OR ARE MORE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION, SUCH AS THE RIGHTS TO DISCOVERY AND TO APPEAL.Arbitration shall be commenced by filing a petition with, and in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules of, JAMS or National Arbitration Forum (the “Administrator”) as selected by the initiating party.  If the parties to the Dispute agree, arbitration may be commenced by appointment of a licensed attorney who is selected by the parties to the Dispute and who agrees to conduct the arbitration without an Administrator.  Disputes include matters (i) relating to a deposit account, application for or denial of credit, enforcement of any of the obligations any party hereto has to any of the other parties hereto, compliance with applicable laws and/or regulations, performance of services provided under any agreement by any party hereto, (ii) based on or arising from an alleged tort or (iii) involving any party’s employees, agents, affiliates or assigns, Disputes do not, however, include the validity, enforceability, meaning or scope of this arbitration provision and such matters may be determined only by a court.  If a third party is a party to a Dispute, each party hereto consents to including the third party in the arbitration proceeding for resolving the - 19 -Dispute with the third party.  Venue for the arbitration proceeding shall be in Houston, Harris County, Texas.If a court issues an Arbitration Order, all parties to the Dispute that did not seek the Arbitration Order shall commence arbitration.  The party hereto that sought the Arbitration Order may commence arbitration, but shall have no obligation to do so, and shall not in any way be adversely prejudiced by initiating or participating in litigation or electing not to commence arbitration.  The arbitrator shall (i) hear and rule on appropriate dispositive motions for judgment on the pleadings, for failure to state a claim or for full or partial summary judgment, (ii) render a decision and any award applying applicable law, (iii) give effect to any limitations period in determining any Dispute or defense, (iv) enforce the doctrines of compulsory counterclaim, res judicata and collateral estoppel, if applicable, (v) with regard to motions and the arbitration hearing, apply rules of evidence governing civil cases and (vi) apply the law of the state specified in the agreement giving rise to the Dispute.  Filing of a petition for arbitration shall not prevent any party from (i) seeking and obtaining from a court of competent jurisdiction (notwithstanding ongoing arbitration) provisional or ancillary remedies including injunctive relief, property preservation orders, foreclosure, eviction, attachment, replevin, garnishment and/or the appointment of a receiver, (ii) pursuing non-judicial foreclosure or (iii) availing itself of any self-help remedies, such as setoff and repossession.  The exercise of such rights shall not constitute a waiver of the right to submit any Dispute to arbitration.Judgment upon an arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction, except that, if the arbitration award exceeds $4,000,000, any party to the relevant Dispute shall be entitled to a de novo appeal of the award before a panel of three arbitrators.  To allow for such appeal, if the award (including the Administrator’s, the arbitrator’s and attorney’s fees and costs) exceeds $4,000,000, the arbitrator will issue a written, reasoned decision supporting the award, including a statement of authority and its application to the Dispute.  A request for de novo appeal must be filed with the arbitrator within 30 days following the date of the arbitration award.  If such a request is not made within that time period, the arbitration decision shall become final and binding.  On appeal, the arbitrators shall review the award de novo, meaning that they shall reach their own findings of fact and conclusions of law, rather than deferring in any manner to the original arbitrator.  Appeal of an arbitration award shall be pursuant to the rules of the Administrator or, if the Administrator has no such rules, then the JAMS arbitration appellate rules shall apply.Arbitration under this provision concerns a transaction involving interstate commerce and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.  This arbitration provision shall survive any termination, amendment or expiration of this Agreement.  If the terms of this provision vary from the Administrator’s rules, this arbitration provision shall control.(d)    Each party hereto (i) certifies that no one has represented to such party that any other party would not seek to enforce jury and class action waivers in the event of suit, and (ii) acknowledges that it and the other parties have been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers, agreements and certifications in this Section 20.21.    Waiver of Punitive and Consequential Damages.  EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY, INTENTIONALLY AND IRREVOCABLY (A) WAIVES, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT IT MAY LAWFULLY AND - 20 -EFFECTIVELY DO SO, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO CLAIM OR RECOVER, IN ANY DISPUTE BASED HEREON, OR DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY AT ANY TIME ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES OTHER THAN, OR IN ADDITION TO, ACTUAL DAMAGES (IT BEING ACKNOWLEDGED AND AGREED THAT DAMAGES CONTEMPLATED BY SECTION 6(E) OF THE BP ISDA, THE SHELL ISDA OR ANY OTHER ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT BETWEEN BORROWER AND ANY OTHER APPROVED HEDGE COUNTERPARTY ARE ACTUAL DAMAGES FOR PURPOSES OF THIS WAIVER) AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION 21.22.    Reinstatement; Termination.(a)    If at any time any payment of the Loan Obligations or the Approved Hedge Counterparty Obligations is rescinded or must be restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of Borrower or any Guarantor or otherwise, the obligations of Borrower, Guarantors, Agent, Approved Hedge Counterparties and Collateral Agent under this Agreement, with respect to that payment, shall be reinstated as though the payment had been due but not made at that time.(b)    If all of the Approved Hedge Counterparty Obligations (other than contingent Approved Hedge Counterparty Obligations with respect to which no claim has been made) have been indefeasibly paid in full or terminated (and all settlement amounts, unpaid amounts, interest and other amounts then due to each Approved Hedge Counterparty thereunder have been paid in full) or the terms of all Approved Hedge Agreements have otherwise expired, in the sole determination of each Approved Hedge Counterparty under its Approved Hedge Agreement, then, at the request of Borrower, all of the parties hereto as of such time shall terminate this Agreement in writing and this Agreement shall thereupon be terminated in all respects and for all purposes.  (c)    If all of the Approved Hedge Agreements with an Approved Hedge Counterparty have been indefeasibly paid in full or terminated (and all settlement amounts, unpaid amounts, interest and other amounts then due to such Approved Hedge Counterparty have been paid in full) or the terms of all such contracts have otherwise expired, in the sole determination of each Approved Hedge Counterparty under its Approved Hedge Agreement, then, upon written notice from such Approved Hedge Counterparty or Borrower (confirmed in writing by the other) to each other Approved Hedge Counterparty, Agent and Collateral Agent of such circumstance, such counterparty shall cease to be an “Approved Hedge Counterparty” for all purposes, shall be deemed removed as an “Approved Hedge Counterparty” under this Agreement and shall thereafter have no rights under the Security Instruments.(d)    If Borrower has issued or arranged for a third party to issue to an Approved Hedge Counterparty a letter of credit as credit support replacement for the Security Instruments then securing such Approved Hedge Counterparty (such letter of credit to be in form and substance and in an amount and from an issuing bank satisfactory to such Approved Hedge Counterparty) to secure payment of any of its obligations under the Approved Hedge Agreements to which such Approved - 21 -Hedge Counterparty is a party, any Approved Hedge Counterparty Obligations supported by such a letter of credit (and only to the extent of the undrawn face amount thereof) shall not be secured by the Security Instruments so long as such a letter of credit remains legally enforceable and valid.(e)    Any Approved Hedge Counterparty under this Agreement and the Security Instruments may at any time elect to no longer be an “Approved Hedge Counterparty” under this Agreement and the Security Instruments by giving written notice to Collateral Agent, Agent, all other Approved Hedge Counterparties and Borrower, and upon delivery of such written notice, such counterparty shall cease to be an “Approved Hedge Counterparty” for all purposes, and each Commodity Hedge Agreement of such Person shall cease to be an Approved Hedge Agreement.23.    Controlling Agreement.  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any of the Loan Documents or the Approved Hedge Agreements, to the extent the terms of this Agreement directly conflict with a provision in any of the Loan Documents or the Approved Hedge Agreements, the terms of this Agreement shall control.24.    Integration.  THIS AGREEMENT AND ALL DOCUMENTS AND INSTRUMENTS REFERENCED HEREIN, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ALL JOINDER SUPPLEMENTS, REPRESENT THE FINAL AGREEMENT AMONG AGENT, APPROVED HEDGE COUNTERPARTIES, BORROWER, GUARANTORS AND COLLATERAL AGENT WITH RESPECT TO THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF AND THEREOF AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS BY SUCH PARTIES.  THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS AMONG SUCH PARTIES.25.    Confidentiality.  The contents of this Agreement, the Approved Hedge Agreements and any information provided by Borrower or Guarantors to Agent, Collateral Agent or any Lenders in connection with any Approved Hedge Agreement, and all other documents relating to this Agreement or the Approved Hedge Agreements, including, but not limited to, the prices and the mark to market data for existing transactions, and any information made available by one party to another party with respect to this Agreement and the Approved Hedge Agreements is confidential and shall not be disclosed to any third party (nor shall any public announcement relating to this Agreement be made by any party), except for such information (a) as may become generally available to the public, (b) as may be required or appropriate in response to any summons, subpoena or otherwise in connection with any litigation or to comply with any applicable law, order, regulation, ruling or accounting disclosure rule or standard or to comply with any request of any regulatory authority, (c) as may be obtained from a non-confidential source that disclosed such information in a manner that did not violate its confidential obligations to any party hereto in making such disclosure, (d) as may be furnished to the disclosing party’s Affiliates (as defined in the Credit Agreement), and to each of such Person’s auditors, attorneys, advisors or lenders which are required to keep the information that is disclosed in confidence or (e) identifying notional quantities.
