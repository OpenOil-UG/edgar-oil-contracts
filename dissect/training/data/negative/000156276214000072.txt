			In consideration for receipt of the Purchase Price, as of and from the Effective Date the Grantor hereby grants to the Grantee a production payment equal to the Production Payment Percentage of the proceeds of the sale of Available Production from the Subject Interests (the “Production Payment”), free and clear of any and all Encumbrances (except the Permitted Encumbrances) and all costs, expenses and deductions whatsoever, including all development, production, operational and Decommissioning Liabilities.

				 2.4
			
		
			
			The Grantee shall look solely to the proceeds from the sale of Available Production attributable to the Production Payment Percentage under this Agreement for satisfaction and discharge of all amounts due pursuant to such Production Payment, and the Grantor shall not be personally liable for the payment and discharge thereof.

				 (a)
			
		
			
			relieve the Grantor of its liability to account to the Grantee for the Production Payment Percentage of the proceeds of sale of Available Production which the Grantor received from the sale of such Available Production and which the Grantor fails to deliver to the Grantee in accordance with this Agreement; 
		
			
				 (b)
			
		
			
			relieve the Grantor of any obligation to respond in damages for breach of any of the warranties, covenants or other obligations set out in this Agreement and agreements entered into in connection herewith; 
		
			
				 (c)
			
		
			
			relieve the Grantor of its liability to make direct payment to the Grantee of any and all amounts falling due under and in accordance with Clause 3.2; and
		
			
				 (d)
			
		
			
			shall prevent the Grantee from being able to enforce its security in accordance with the terms of the Production Payment Security Documents and to look to the proceeds of such security for satisfaction and discharge of any and all amounts owing hereunder and in connection herewith, subject to the principle in Clause 2.4 that the Grantee shall only be entitled to enforce the security in order to recover amounts with respect to the proceeds from the sale of Available Production attributable to the Production Payment Percentage to which it would have been entitled under this Agreement.
		
			
				 2.6
			
		
			
			The Production Payment on Petroleum produced and saved from or allocated to the Subject Interests shall not be taken in kind by the Grantee and shall be payable only in money.
		
			
				 2.7
			
		
			
			All payments made pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, whether in respect of a Production Payment or otherwise, shall be made in Dollars.
		
			
				 2.8
			
		
			
			The Grantor shall use reasonable efforts to procure the written approval of the Secretary for the terms of the Production Payment to permit the maximum percentage of Available Production to which the Grantee shall be entitled pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, for all periods following the sixth (6th)  Settlement Date, to equal ninety per cent. (90%) of Available Production (the “Second Consent”).  The Grantor shall promptly deliver to the Grantee the request for the Second Consent and the response from the Secretary and any other written correspondence between the Secretary and the Grantor related to the Second Consent.
		
			
				 3.
			
		
			
			SALE AND PAYMENT
		
			
				 3.1
			
		
			
			With effect on and from the date hereof, the Grantor will be responsible for the marketing and sale of Available Production attributable to the Production Payment at the Current Market Value and the Grantor will disburse to the Grantee an amount equal to the sale proceeds thereof multiplied by the Production Payment Percentage to be paid within twenty (20) days after the end of each Relevant Period, provided that a sale has been made in such Relevant Period, by wire transfer to such account as shall be notified in writing by the Grantee to the Grantor. 
		
			
				 3.2
			
		
			
			If the Grantor fails to pay any amount payable by it in accordance with Clause 3.1 above on its due date (the “Unpaid Amount”), it shall become liable to pay forthwith

				 3.4
			
		
			
			The Grantor shall ensure that all proceeds it receives from or in connection with the sale of its share of Petroleum allocated to the Subject Interests for each Relevant Period is deposited directly by the relevant contract counterparties into the applicable Rochelle Payment Account.
		
			
				 3.5
			
		
			
			If the Grantor shall wish to sell any Petroleum attributable to the Production Payment for less than the Current Market Value, the Parties shall agree upon the fair market value at which such Petroleum may be sold and such fair market value shall be adopted (and shall replace the Current Market Value) for the purposes of quantifying the Production Payment relating to such Available Production. 
		
			
				 3.6
			
		
			
			If the Parties are unable to agree upon the fair market value or on a mechanism for determining the same pursuant to Clause 3.5 within seven (7) days, the matter may be referred by the Grantee to an independent expert pursuant to Clause 13, provided that in making such determination the independent expert will have regard to the principle that the Grantee should not be required to accept any price or mechanism if and to the extent that the application of the same would result in the Grantee receiving a lower price for the Production Payment than would otherwise have been the case if the same were sold on an open market, arm's length basis.
		
			
				 3.7
			
		
			
			The Parties hereby agree that the Grantor shall be entitled to enter into any forward sale, pre-payment or other similar arrangements without the prior consent of the Grantee provided that at any one time the aggregate Dollar value, based on the price actually payable under the relevant transaction, of all Petroleum required to be delivered by the Grantor to counterparties and outstanding under all such forward sale, pre-payment or other similar arrangements shall not be in excess of:

				 4.1

				 4.2
			
		
			
			Clause 4.1 above shall not apply: 
		
			
				 (a)
			
		
			
			to the extent the Tax liability arises as a result of:
		
			
				 (i)
			
		
			
			the Grantee being resident for tax purposes in the UK; or
		
			
				 (ii)
			
		
			
			the Grantee having a permanent establishment in the UK (other than a permanent establishment which arises solely as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement); or
		
			
				 (iii)
			
		
			
			the Grantee becoming resident for tax purposes in any jurisdiction other than Luxembourg other than as a result of the capitalisation or capital structure of the Grantee; or

			Any increase in the Production Payment Percentage pursuant to Clause 4.1 shall be satisfied on the Settlement Date immediately following the date on which the tax in question becomes recoverable by HMRC.  
		
			
				 4.4
			
		
			
			In the event the Grantor is required to indemnify the Grantee pursuant to Clause 4.1, the Grantee shall take such action, at the sole cost and expense of the Grantor, as the Grantor may reasonably request to avoid, dispute, resist, appeal, compromise or defend any assessment (a “Contest”) of the Grantee to tax by HMRC (the “Tax Assessment”).  The Grantor shall have the right to control any proceedings taken in connection with the Tax Assessment and agrees to pay directly to the taxing authority any required payments of tax, interest and penalties that are required to be paid in connection with, or as a precondition to, such Contest. The Grantee shall provide the Grantor with copies of all correspondence and documentation relating to the Tax Assessment and such other information, assistance and access to records and personnel as it reasonably requires.  The Grantee shall procure that no tax claim, action or issue in respect of which the Grantor could be required to make a payment under this Agreement is settled or otherwise compromised without the Grantor’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld).

			Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Grantee shall not be required to Contest or continue any Contest of a Tax Assessment if:
		 

		

			10

		

		

			 

		

		

			 

		

		

			 

		

 

		

			 

		


		
			
				 (a)
			
		
			
			the Grantee considers (acting reasonably) that it will not be properly reimbursed for costs and expenses already incurred in connection with the Contest of such Tax Assessment;
		
			
				 (b)
			
		
			
			the Grantor has not furnished the Grantee with written advice from a law firm practicing in relation to English law in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Grantee to the effect that there is a reasonable basis for the Contest; or
		
			
				 (c)
			
		
			
			the Grantee considers, in its reasonable discretion, such Contest might materially prejudice it or any MC Admin Co LLC affiliated entity.
		
			
				 4.6
			
		
			
			The Grantor shall indemnify the Grantee for its reasonable costs and expenses properly incurred in connection with any such action or proceedings as are referred to in Clause 4.4, such indemnity to be satisfied by way of an increase in the Production Payment Percentage.

			Subject to Clause 4.10, if the Grantor becomes aware that any deduction or withholding is required by law from any payment under this Agreement, then:
		
			
				 (a)
			
		
			
			the Grantor shall notify the Grantee of the requirement to deduct or withhold an amount; 
		
			
				 (b)
			
		
			
			the Grantor and the Grantee shall use reasonable endeavours so that payment can be made without such a withholding or deduction;
		
			
				 (c)
			
		
			
			in the event a withholding or deduction is required, the Grantor and the Grantee shall agree to increase the Production Payment Percentage so that, overall, the Grantee is in no better or worse position than it would have been had no withholding or deduction been imposed.
		
			
				 4.9
			
		
			
			To the extent that any deduction or withholding in respect of which an additional amount has been paid under Clause 4.8 above results in the Grantee obtaining a relief (all reasonable endeavours having been used to obtain such relief), the Grantee shall pay to the Grantor, within ten (10) Business Days of obtaining the benefit of the relief, an amount equal to the lesser of the value of the relief obtained and the additional sum paid under Clause 4.8. The Grantor, upon request of the Grantee, shall repay to the Grantee the amount paid to the Grantor pursuant to this Clause 4.9 (plus any interest, penalties or other charges imposed by the taxing authority) in the event that the Grantee is required to repay such relief.
		
			
				 4.10
			
		
			
			Clause 4.8(c) shall not apply to the extent that the deduction or withholding would not have arisen but for an assignment by the Grantee of any of its rights under this Agreement.

			Co-operation
		
		
			
				 4.12

				 4.13
			
		
			
			If requested by the Grantor, the Grantee shall use all reasonable endeavours to satisfy and maintain its tax residence for the purposes of any applicable double taxation treaty between the UK and the jurisdiction of incorporation of the Grantee, provided that the Grantee shall not be required to do so if it would cause financial loss for it, MC Admin Co LLC or any MC Admin Co LLC affiliated entity (unless the Grantor indemnifies the Grantee in respect of such loss). If the Grantee considers that maintaining its tax residence in such manner would cause such financial loss, the Grantee shall notify the Grantor.

				 11.2
			
		
			
			In the event that the Grantor sells, transfers or otherwise disposes of the whole or any part of the Subject Interests and such sale, transfer or disposal has been consented to by the Grantee pursuant to Clause 5.1, the Parties shall in good faith and using all reasonable endeavours agree upon a corresponding proportion of the rights, liabilities and obligations under this Agreement which shall be transferred to and assumed by

		the purchaser.

			Subject to Clause 13, the courts of England have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement (including a dispute relating to the existence, validity or termination of this Agreement or any non-contractual obligation arising out of or in connection with this Agreement) (a “Dispute”) and the Parties agree that the courts of England are the most appropriate and convenient forum to settle Disputes and accordingly no Party will argue to the contrary.
		
			
				 13.
			
		
			
			EXPERT DETERMINATION
		
			
				 13.1
			
		
			
			In the event of a request for expert determination pursuant to either Clause 3.6 or Clause 6.3, each matter of dispute shall be finally resolved and determined by a mutually acceptable partner in the London office of a leading international firm of chartered accountants, which individual shall have not less than ten (10) years of experience in the United Kingdom North Sea oil and gas industry.  If the Parties are unable to agree such appointment within a period of thirty (30) days after the date of any referral by the relevant Party, then either Party may request in writing such appointment be made by the President for the time being of the Institute of Chartered Accountants for England and Wales.  
		
			
				 13.2
			
		
			
			Any such independent chartered account appointed hereunder shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator.  The Parties shall cooperate fully with any such independent chartered accountant and for this purpose shall make available to such independent chartered accountant all such books, records and statements of account as he or she may reasonably require in order to reach a determination hereunder.  The decision of the independent chartered accountant shall be given in writing within sixty (60) days after the date of his or her appointment and, in the absence of fraud, mistake of fact or law or other manifest error, will be final and binding on the Parties.  The costs of the independent chartered accountant shall be borne by the Parties in such proportion as the independent chartered accountant shall determine and in the absence of such determination shall be borne equally.

		required by the other Party in order to fully perform and carry out the terms of this Agreement.
		
			
				 14.2
			
		
			
			This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Parties and their successors and permitted assigns.
		
			
				 14.3
			
		
			
			No supplement to or modification of any provision of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by each Party.
		
			
				 14.4

				 14.5
			
		
			
			This Agreement, the Sale and Purchase Agreement and the Completion Documents replace and supersede any and all previous agreements, whether written or oral, between the Parties with respect to the Subject Interests insofar as such agreements pertain to the payment to the Grantee by the Grantor of the Production Payment.

			Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as creating a partnership, association or trust of any kind or as imposing any partnership duty, liability or obligation.
		
			
				 14.7
			
		
			
			If any provision of this Agreement (or part of a provision) is found by any court or administrative body of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, the other provisions shall remain in force.  If any invalid, unenforceable or illegal provision would be valid, enforceable or legal if some part of it were deleted, the provision shall apply with whatever modification is necessary to give effect to the commercial intention of the Parties.
		
			
				 14.8
			
		
			
			The operation of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 is hereby excluded and no term of this Agreement is intended to be enforceable by any person who is not a party to this Agreement, notwithstanding that any such term of this Agreement may purport to confer, or may be construed as conferring any benefit on such person and irrespective of whether such person is identified in this Agreement.  
		
			
				 14.9
			
		
			
			This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which is an original and which together have the same effect as if each Party had signed the same document, provided, however, that none of the counterparts will be effective until both Parties have executed a counterpart hereof.  
		
			
				 14.10
			
		
			
			The Grantor shall, on demand, pay to the Grantee the amount of all costs and expenses (including legal fees) incurred by the Grantee in connection with the enforcement of or preservation of any rights under this Agreement.
		
			
				 14.11
			
		
			
			If, at any time on or after the date of this Agreement, EIC, the Grantor or any of their Subsidiaries grants or has granted security over any of their respective rights, interests or property to secure the Seller’s Grantor’s obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement and/or the New Pearl Reimbursement Agreement (including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 7.18 of the Revolving Credit Agreement or Section 7.18 of the New Pearl Reimbursement Agreement); which rights, interests and

		property are not subject to security granted in favour of Grantee to secure the obligations of Grantor hereunder, the Grantor shall, or shall procure that, concurrently therewith EIC, the Grantor or such Subsidiary (as applicable) grants security in respect of the same rights, interests and property to Grantee to secure the obligations of Grantor hereunder. Such security shall be granted pursuant to security agreements, mortgages, deeds of trust or other documents, instruments and agreements which are in substantially the same form (mutatis mutandis) as the security agreements, mortgages, deeds of trust or other documents, instruments and agreements pursuant to which security is granted to secure the obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement and/or the New Pearl Reimbursement Agreement, except such security may vary as to lien priority. Any collateral pledged to the Grantee in accordance with this Section 14.11 may be disposed of, and the lien thereon released, pursuant to provisions which are substantially the same as those set forth in Section 23(Termination)  of the New York law security agreement described in paragraph (d) of the definition of “Completion Documents” set out in the Sale and Purchase Agreement or clause 17 of the Security Agreement (as defined in the Sale and Purchase Agreement).
