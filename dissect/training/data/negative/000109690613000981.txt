This Common Stock Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement") is made as of April 17, 2013, among Worthington Energy, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the "Company") and Charles Volk (the "Investor").




The Investor understands that the Company proposes to offer and sell to the Investor 1,000,000 shares of its Series A Preferred Stock at a purchase price of $0.05 per share.




1.           Purchase and Sale of Common Stock.




a.           The Common Stock.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Investor agrees to purchase from the Company 1,000,000 shares of Company Series A Preferred Stock at a purchase price of $0.05 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $50,000.00.   The Common Stock is referred to as the “Securities”.




b.           Initial Closing.




The purchase and sale of the Securities shall take place at the offices of the Company at 220 Montgomery Street, Suite 1094, San Francisco, CA  94104 ("Closing").  At the Closing, the Company shall deliver to the Investor the Securities, which such Investor is purchasing against delivery to the Company by such Investor of cancellation of indebtedness in the ag­gregate amount of the purchase price due to the Investor for previously unpaid back salary.




2.           The Company's Representations and Warranties.  The Company represents and warrants to the Investor as follows:




a.           Organization and Standing.  The Company is a corporation duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the State of Nevada.




b.           Authorization.  The execution, delivery and perfor­mance of this Agreement by the Company has been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action, and this Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject as to enforcement of remedies to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights.  The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and compli­ance with the provisions hereof by the Company does not conflict with, or result in a breach or violation of the terms, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default (or an event with which the giving of notice or passage of time, or both could result in a default) under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien pursuant to the terms of, the Articles of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Company.




c.           Securities. When issued pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Securities will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and will be free of any liens or encumbrances caused or created by the Company; provided, however, that the Securities shall be subject to restrictions on transfer under state or federal securities laws as set forth in this Agreement or otherwise required at the time a transfer is proposed.






  



  







  






3.           Representations, Warranties of Investor and Restrictions on Transfer




a.           Representations and Warranties of Investor.  The Investor represents and warrants to the Company with respect to the purchase of Securities under this Agreement as follows:




i.           This Agreement constitutes the Investor’s valid and legally binding obligation, enforceable in accordance with its terms.




ii.           The Investor is acquiring the Securities for its own account for investment purposes only and not with a view to, or for the resale in connection with, any "distribution" thereof for purposes of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act").  The Investor understands that the Securities have not been registered under the Act or any applicable state securities laws by reason of a specific exemption therefrom that depends upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of the investment intent as expressed herein.




iii.           The Investor has discussed the Company and its plans, operations and financial condition with its officers and has received all such information as the Investor deems necessary and appropriate to enable the Investor to evaluate the financial risk inherent in making an investment in the Securities.  The Investor has received satisfactory and complete information concerning the business and financial condition of the Company in response to the Investor's inquiries.




iv.           The Investor realizes that the acquisition of the Securities will be a highly speculative investment.  The Investor is able, without impairing the Investor's financial condition, to hold the Securities for an indefinite period of time and to suffer a complete loss of the Investor's investment.  The Investor recognizes that the Company has only recently been organized and that it has a limited financial and operating history and the investment in the Company involves substantial risks.  The Investor understands all of the risks related to the acquisition of the Securities.  By virtue of the Investor's experience in evaluating and investing in private placement transactions of securities in companies similar to the Company, the Investor is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the Investor's investment in the Company and has the capacity to protect the Investor's own interests.




v.           The Investor understands that the Securities must be held indefinitely unless subsequently registered under the Act or unless an exemption from registration is otherwise available.  Moreover, the Investor understands that the Company is under no obligation to register the Securities.  The Investor is aware of Rule 144 promulgated under the Act that permits limited resale of secur­ities purchased in a private placement subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.  The Investor understands that the Securities will be imprinted with a legend which prohibits the transfer of the Securities unless they are registered or such registration is not required in the opinion of counsel for the Company.

 



  



  







  



 

vi. The Investor has substantial experience in evaluating and investing in securities of companies similar to the Company and acknowledges that it can protect its own interests. The Investor has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters so it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its investment in the Company.  The Investor is an “accredited investors” within the meaning of Regulation D, Rule 501(a), promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act.




 vii.           The Investor confirms that the statements made in the Confidential Prospective Purchaser Questionnaire are true on the date hereof, and acknowledges that the statements made therein have been relied upon by the Company in making its offering to Investor.  The Investor agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its respective officers, directors and stockholders, from any and all damages, losses, costs and expenses(including reasonable attorneys’ fees) that they may incur, by reason of any breach of any of the statements or representations made by Investor contained  herein or therein.

 

b.           Legends.  In addition to any legend imposed by state securities laws, each certificate representing the Securities shall be endorsed with the following legends:




THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "ACT"), OR UNDER THE SECURITIES LAWS OF CERTAIN STATES. THESE SECURITIES ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFERABILITY AND RESALE AND MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED OR RESOLD EXCEPT AS PERMITTED UNDER THE ACT AND THE APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS, PURSUANT TO REGISTRATION OR EXEMPTION THEREFROM. INVESTORS SHOULD BE AWARE THAT THEY MAY BE REQUIRED TO BEAR THE FINANCIAL RISKS OF THIS INVESTMENT FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD OF TIME. THE ISSUER OF THESE SECURITIES MAY REQUIRE AN OPINION OF COUNSEL IN FORM AND SUBSTANCE SATISFACTORY TO THE ISSUER TO THE EFFECT THAT ANY PROPOSED TRANSFER OR RESALE IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE ACT AND ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS.




The Company need not register a transfer of Securities unless the conditions specified in the foregoing legends are satisfied.  The Company may also instruct its transfer agent not to register the transfer of any of the Securities unless the conditions specified in the foregoing legends are satisfied.




c.           Removal of Legends and Transfer Restrictions.  The legend relating to the Act endorsed on a stock certificate pursuant to paragraph 4(b) of this Agreement and the stop transfer instruc­tions with respect to such Securities shall be removed and the Company shall issue a stock certificate without such legend to the holder of such Securities if such Shares are regis­tered under the Act and a prospectus meeting the requirements of Section 10 of the Act is available, or if such holder provides to the Company an opinion of counsel for such holder of the Shares or Note reasonably satisfactory to the Company or a no-action letter or interpretive opinion of the staff of the Commission to the effect that a public sale, transfer or assignment of such Shares or Note may be made without registration and without compliance with any restric­tion such as Rule 144.  Any legend imposed by state securities laws will be removed if the state agency imposing such legend has consented to its removal.




4.           Miscellaneous.




a.           Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of Nevada without regard to the conflict of law provisions thereof.




b.           Survival.  The representations and warranties con­tained herein shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the sale of the Securities.




c.           Successors and Assigns.  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the provisions hereof shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the successors, assigns, heirs, executors and administrators of the parties hereto.






  



  







  



 

d.           Entire Agreement.  This Agreement embodies the entire understanding and agreement between each Investor and the Company and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings relating to the subject matter hereof.
