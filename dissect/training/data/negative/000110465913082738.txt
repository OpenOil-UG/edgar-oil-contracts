Re:                             Waiver and Amendment for Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of May 31, 2013 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified to date, the Credit Agreement), among Sanchez Energy Corporation, SEP Holdings III, LLC, SN Marquis, LLC and SN Cotulla Assets, LLC (collectively, the Borrowers), each of the Lenders from time to time party thereto (the Lenders), and Royal Bank of Canada, as administrative agent for the Lenders (in such capacity, together with its successors in such capacity, the Administrative Agent)
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
This letter (this Letter) relates to the Credit Agreement.  Each capitalized term not defined herein shall have the meaning assigned to such term in the Credit Agreement.  All references to sections in this Letter shall be to sections of the Credit Agreement unless otherwise indicated.
 
Waiver
 
The Borrowers have informed the Administrative Agent that the Borrowers recently entered into certain oil Swap Agreements which, when aggregated with existing oil Swap Agreements, bring total oil Swap Agreements for the six month period ending on June 30, 2014 to 5,750 barrels per day (the Specified Swaps).  This results in oil Swap Agreement volumes of 50.8% of total Proved Reserves based off of the 6/30/13 Reserve Report.  This exceeds the maximum allowed limit of 50% of total Proved Reserves specified in Section 9.17 of the Credit Agreement (the Specified Event).
 
The Borrowers have requested, and the Required Lenders hereby consent to, a waiver with regard to the Specified Event as it relates to the Specified Swaps.
 
Amendments
 
A.            The Credit Agreement currently defines Unrestricted Cash to include Investments described in Section 9.05(c) (accounts receivable arising in the ordinary course of business) and excludes Investments described in Section 9.05(g) (deposits in money market funds).  The definition of Unrestricted Cash in the Credit Agreement is hereby amended to read as follows:
 






 
Unrestricted Cash means Investments of the Borrowers and their Unrestricted Subsidiaries described in Section 9.05(d), Section 9.05(e), Section 9.05(f) and Section 9.05(g) which are subject to no Liens other than Liens in favor of the Lenders and Secured Swap Providers.
 
B.            The Credit Agreement, in relevant part, currently limits commodity hedging through Swap Agreements to no more than the greater of (i) 90% of the value of proved developed producing reserves and (ii) 50% of total proved reserves during the first two years of the Agreement and to no more than the greater of (y) 85% of the value of proved developed producing reserves and (z) 50% of total proved reserves during the third and fourth years of the Agreement.  However, it is desired to have the 90% and 50% limits apply on a rolling 2-year basis from the testing date and the 85% and 50% limits apply on a rolling 2-year basis to the third and fourth years from the testing date.  It is also desired to make more explicit that certain types of Swap Agreements, specifically floor and put options, are permissible if entered into with an Approved Counterparty but are not subject to the percentage limits otherwise applicable to Swap Agreements.  Therefore, Section 9.17 of the Agreement is hereby amended to read in its entirety as follows:
 
Section 9.17. Swap Agreements.  The Borrowers will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into any Swap Agreements with any Person other than (a) Swap Agreements constituting floor or put options in respect of commodities with an Approved Counterparty, (b) Swap Agreements (other than floor or put options) in respect of commodities with an Approved Counterparty that are limited to notional quantities at any time no more than (i) during the first two years following such time the greater of (x) ninety percent (90%) of the value of proved developed producing reserves included in the then most recently delivered Reserve Report and (y) fifty percent (50%) of Borrowers total Proved Reserves (such amounts computed on a semi-annual basis and calculated on a product-by-product basis), (ii) during the third and fourth years following such time the greater of (x) eighty-five percent (85%) of the value of proved developed producing reserves included in the then most recently delivered Reserve Report and (y) fifty percent (50%) of Borrowers total Proved Reserves (such amounts computed on a semi-annual basis and calculated on a product-by-product basis), and (iii) after the fourth year following such time, zero (no commodity Swap Agreements other than floor or put options); provided that the aggregate amount of all such commodity Swap Agreements (other than floor or put options) shall not exceed the most recent months actual production, calculated separately on a product-by-product basis, in any given month, (c) Swap Agreements in respect of interest rates with an Approved Counterparty, as follows: (i) Swap Agreements effectively converting interest rates from fixed to floating, the notional amounts of which (when aggregated with all other Swap Agreements of the Borrowers and their Restricted Subsidiaries then in effect effectively converting interest rates from fixed to floating) do not exceed 75% of the then outstanding principal amount of the Borrowers Debt for borrowed money which bears interest at a fixed rate and (ii) Swap Agreements effectively converting interest rates from floating to fixed, the notional amounts of which

(when aggregated with all other Swap Agreements of the Borrowers and their respective Restricted Subsidiaries then in effect effectively converting interest rates from floating to fixed) do not exceed 75% of the then outstanding principal amount of the Borrowers Debt for borrowed money which bears interest at a floating rate and (d) those certain Swap Agreements existing on the date hereof and described on Schedule 9.17 between SEP and Shell Energy North America (US), L.P. and between SEP and Macquarie Bank Limited. The Borrowers will not, and will not permit any other Loan Party to, Liquidate any Swap Agreement in respect of commodities unless (x) if such Swap Liquidation would result in an automatic redetermination of the Borrowing Base pursuant to Section 2.07(b)(iv), the Borrowers deliver reasonable prior written notice thereof to the Administrative Agent, and (y) if a Borrowing Base Deficiency would result from such Swap Liquidation as a result of an automatic redetermination of the Borrowing Base pursuant to Section 2.07(b)(iv), the Borrowers prepay Borrowings, prior to or contemporaneously with the consummation of such Swap Liquidation to the extent that such prepayment would have been required under Section 3.04(c)(i) after giving effect to such automatic redetermination of the Borrowing Base.
