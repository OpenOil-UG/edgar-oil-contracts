NINTH AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT

 

This Ninth Amendment to Credit Agreement (this “Ninth Amendment”) is entered into as of November 2, 2012 (the “Ninth Amendment Effective Date”), by and among Denbury Resources Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Borrower”), JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent (“Administrative Agent”), and the financial institutions parties hereto as Banks (hereinafter collectively referred to as “Executing Banks”, and each individually, an “Executing Bank”).

 

W I T N E S S E T H

 

 WHEREAS, Borrower, Administrative Agent, the other agents party thereto and Banks are parties to that certain Credit Agreement dated as of March 9, 2010 (the “Credit Agreement”) (unless otherwise defined herein, all terms used herein with their initial letter capitalized shall have the meaning given such terms in the Credit Agreement, including, to the extent applicable, after giving effect to the amendments set forth in Section 1 of this Ninth Amendment);

 

 WHEREAS, pursuant to the Credit Agreement, Banks have made a Revolving Loan to Borrower and provided certain other credit accommodations to Borrower;

 

WHEREAS, Borrower has advised Administrative Agent and Banks that pursuant to that certain Exchange Agreement dated as of September 19, 2012 by and among Onshore, XTO Energy Inc. (“XTO Energy”) and Exxon Mobil Corporation (collectively, with XTO Energy, “XTO”), Onshore has agreed to transfer certain of its Mineral Interests located in the oil and gas field commonly referred to as the Bakken Shale (and defined as the “DRI Assets” in such Exchange Agreement) to XTO in exchange for certain Mineral Interests and cash consideration (such transaction, the “Bakken Exchange”);

 

WHEREAS, Borrower has further advised Administrative Agent and Banks that the loss of oil production as a result of the Bakken Exchange may cause the Credit Parties to have (a) hedged more than 100% of the reasonably anticipated projected production from Proved Mineral Interests of oil which would be prohibited by Section 9.11(a)(i) of the Credit Agreement, and (b) total production of oil that is less than the aggregate amount of oil which is the subject of Oil and Gas Hedge Transactions which would be prohibited by Section 9.11(b)(i) of the Credit Agreement (collectively, the “Temporary Potential Oil Hedging Noncompliance”), in each case during the period commencing on the effective date of the Bakken Exchange and continuing through and including December 31, 2013 (such period, the “Specified Period”), which Temporary Potential Oil Hedging Noncompliance would also be prohibited by Section 9.17 of the Credit Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, Borrower has requested that Banks (a) amend certain terms of the Credit Agreement to (i) permit the Bakken Exchange and (ii) make certain other changes thereto as more specifically described herein, and (b) provide a limited waiver of any Temporary Potential Oil Hedging Noncompliance that may occur during the Specified Period; and

 

 WHEREAS, subject to and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, Executing Banks have agreed to Borrower’s requests and to enter into this Ninth Amendment;

 

 NOW THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged and confessed, Borrower, Administrative Agent and Executing Banks hereby agree as follows:

Section 6. Miscellaneous.

 

6.1 No Waivers.  No failure or delay on the part of Administrative Agent or Banks to exercise any right or remedy under the Credit Agreement, any other Loan Papers or applicable law shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right or remedy preclude any other or further exercise of any right or remedy, all of which are cumulative and may be exercised without notice except to the extent notice is expressly required (and has not been waived) under the Credit Agreement, the other Loan Papers and applicable law.

 

6.2 Reaffirmation of Loan Papers.  Any and all of the terms and provisions of the Credit Agreement and the Loan Papers shall, except as amended and modified hereby, remain in full force and effect.  Except as provided in Section 2 hereof, the amendments contemplated hereby shall not limit or impair any Liens securing the Obligations, each of which are hereby ratified, affirmed and extended to secure the Obligations.

6.5 Counterparts.  This Ninth Amendment may be executed in counterparts (including, without limitation, by electronic signature), and all parties need not execute the same counterpart; however, no party shall be bound by this Ninth Amendment until Borrower, Majority Banks and each Restricted Subsidiary have executed a counterpart.  Facsimiles and counterparts executed by electronic signature shall be effective as originals.

 

6.6 Complete Agreement.  THIS NINTH AMENDMENT, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN PAPERS REPRESENT THE FINAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS OR ORAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES.  THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN OR AMONG THE PARTIES.

 

6.7 Headings.  The headings, captions and arrangements used in this Ninth Amendment are, unless specified otherwise, for convenience only and shall not be deemed to limit, amplify or modify the terms of this Ninth Amendment, nor affect the meaning thereof.

 



  



- 4 -







  



 

6.8 Governing Law.  THIS NINTH AMENDMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Ninth Amendment to be duly executed by their respective authorized officers on the date and year first above written.
