2.          NOTE MODIFICATION(S). As of the Effective Date, the outstanding principal balance

of the Note is NINE MILLION TWO HUNDRED NINETY-EIGHT THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY-THREE AND 18/100 DOLLARS ($9,298,183.18). No further sums remain to be advanced under the Note. The following amendments are made to the Note:

 

(a) Beginning one (1) month after the Effective Date, the Note shall be payable in monthly installments of principal including interest, all of such installments, except for the last, being in the amount of SEVENTY-FIVE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED TEN AND 35/100 DOLLARS ($75,310.35) each (or such greater amounts as may be required on account of the adjustment of the interest rate as provided for herein), the first such installment being due and payable one (1) month after the Effective Date, and each subsequent installment shall be due and payable on the same day of each succeeding calendar month thereafter until October 1, 2028, when the then remaining unpaid balance of principal of this Note, plus accrued interest, shall mature and finally become due and payable.

 

(b) Beginning on the Effective Date, the Note shall bear interest, except on past due sums, at a per annum rate equal to the lesser of either (i) the Prime Rate (as defined in the Note) plus TWO AND 25/100 PERCENT (2.25%), floating (which, if based on the Prime Rate in effect on the Effective Date, would result in a per annum interest rate of FIVE AND 50/100 PERCENT (5.50%)), or (ii) the Maximum Rate (as hereinafter defined) permitted by applicable law. All sums which become past due after the Effective Date shall bear interest as provided for in the Note for past due sums.

 

(c) The installments of principal and interest applicable to the Note, as modified hereby, have been calculated based on amortization of principal over a period of one hundred eighty-four (184) months and an interest rate of FIVE AND 50/100 PERCENT (5.50%) per annum. If the interest rate on the Note, as modified hereby, at any time after the effective date hereof exceeds FIVE AND 50/100 PERCENT (5.50%) per annum, the Borrower agrees that the Lender may recalculate the amount of the installment payments due under the Note, as modified hereby, to be sufficient to amortize the then outstanding principal balance of the Note, as modified hereby, over the remainder of its original period of amortization at the new interest rate, as provided for in the Note.

 

(d) After the Effective Date, if the Lender has not received the full amount of any installment payment due under the Note, as modified hereby, the Borrower understands that the Lender may impose, and if imposed, the Borrower shall pay to the Lender, a late charge in an amount and at such time as is provided for in the Note. These provisions shall not waive, modify or extend payment due dates or the Borrower's obligations to timely pay all installments due under the Note, as modified hereby.

 

(e) After the Effective Date, the Borrower agrees and understands that the pre-payment provisions contained in the Note shall remain in effect.

 

3.          USURY SAVINGS CLAUSE. It is the intention of the parties hereto to strictly comply

 

with and conform to all applicable law, including usury laws. Accordingly, notwithstanding any


 



  



3







  



 


provision of the Note, as modified hereby, any of the Security Instruments, any other document, instrument or agreement evidencing, securing or entered into in connection with the Note, as modified hereby, or the loan transaction evidenced thereby, it is expressly stipulated and agreed as follows:

 

(a) in no event shall the Borrower or any other liable party be required to pay interest in excess of the maximum non-usurious contract rate of interest (determined from time to time if the applicable maximum rate is a floating rate) that the Lender may charge the Borrower under applicable law and in regard to which the Borrower would be prevented successfully from raising the claim or defense of usury (the "Maximum Rate"), nor under any circumstances shall the aggregate of all consideration which constitutes interest under applicable law and taken, reserved, charged, received, contracted for, chargeable or receivable under the Note, as modified hereby, any of the Security Instruments, any other document, instrument or agreement evidencing, securing or entered into in connection with the Note, as modified hereby, or the loan transaction evidenced thereby, exceed the maximum amount of interest allowed by applicable law, and any excess interest shall be deemed a mistake and canceled automatically or, if theretofore paid, shall, at the option of the holder of the Note, as modified hereby, either be refunded to the Borrower or credited on the Note, as modified hereby, or any other obligation of the Borrower or any other liable party to the holder hereof; and

 

(b) in the event the maturity of the Note, as modified hereby, is accelerated for any reason before the due date thereof, or in the event of any prepayment hereof, then such consideration that constitutes interest under applicable law may never include or exceed more than the maximum amount allowed by applicable law, and excess interest, if any, provided for in the Note, as modified hereby, or otherwise shall be canceled automatically as of the date of such acceleration or prepayment, and, if theretofore paid, shall, at the option of the holder of the Note, as modified hereby, either be refunded to the Borrower or credited on the Note, as modified hereby, or any other obligation of the Borrower or any other liable party to the holder hereof.

 

In determining whether or not interest paid or payable exceeds the Maximum Rate, Lender and Borrower shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (a) characterize any non-principal payment as an expense, fee, or premium rather than as interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the indebtedness evidenced by the Note, as modified hereby, so that interest for the entire term does not exceed the Maximum Rate. The term "applicable law" shall mean the weekly ceiling from time to time in effect, as provided for in Chapter 303.002 of the Texas Finance Code, as amended, and also includes such other laws of the State of Texas and the United States, as such laws now exist or may be amended or changed in the future, or any new law enacted which is applicable to the Note, as modified hereby, or similar loans, whichever allows the greater rate of interest, provided however, it is expressly agreed that Chapter 346 of the Texas Finance Code, as amended (which regulates certain revolving credit accounts), shall not apply to this Note, as modified hereby, and the loan transaction contemplated thereby. The term "other liable party" includes, but is not limited to, the Borrower and each Guarantor.

 

4.           LIEN CONTINUATION AND OTHER PROVISIONS. The Liens are hereby ratified

and confirmed as continuing to secure payment of the Note, as modified hereby. Nothing herein shall in any manner diminish, impair or extinguish the Note, as modified hereby, any of the Security

Any exhibits, appendices and annexes described in this Agreement as being attached to it are hereby incorporated into it. The headings in this Agreement shall be accorded no significance in interpreting it.

 

5.            RELEASE. The Borrower and each Guarantor acknowledge that there are no existing claims or defenses, personal or otherwise, or rights of setoff whatsoever with respect to the Note, any of the Security Instruments, or any other document, agreement or instrument executed or delivered in connection with, to evidence or as security for the Note.

RE: Lazarus Energy, LLC

Nixon, Wilson County, Texas

Forbearance Agreement

Business & Industry Guarantee Loan Servicing — $10,000,000


12 DEC 2012





 

Dear Ms. del Valle:


 

This is in response to your October 25, 2012, memorandum and accompanying attachments. You have requested concurrence for the following servicing actions: 1) Extension of the Forbearance Agreement for the period of October 25, 2012, through October 25, 2013; 2) reamortization of the loan; 3) application of the additional payment of $83,333.33 from Genesis Energy, LLC (GEL) to go towards the $526,971.96 accrued interest on the Guaranteed Loan. Once the repaid interest has been paid, the $83,333.33 amount will be deposited into the Payment Reserve Account for a period of 12 months.

 

As part of previous servicing transaction, both Genesis and Lazarus asked the lender to forbear foreclosing on the refinery for a total of 24 months, split into two 12 months segments.

 

In the event of continued non-monetary default, the forbearance agreement could be extended for an additional 12 months if all three of the following conditions were met: Lien Holder submitted payments in the amount of either the Tank Storage Fee or Regular Monthly Payment, as applicable, during each of the twelve (12) months of the Forbearance Period; The Services must have been completed under the Construction Contract; The Facility must be operational and generating Gross Profits to the extent that Lien Holder is receiving regular monthly payments.

 

Based on the information provided, we concur with your request. However, in the event the borrower is unable to make the regular required payments and perform under the terms of the Forbearance Agreement, your lending institution should proceed to maximize recovery. Please note that RD Instruction 4279-A, section 4279.72(a), states in part: "The guarantee will be unenforceable to the extent that any loss is occasioned by a provision of interest on interest."

 

In the process of reamortizing the loan, please ensure that there is no capitalization of unpaid interest. Compounded interest is prohibited under Agency regulations.
