Default, the Forbearance Default) constitutes a default under the Credit Agreement.


(b) Forbearance Period. (i) During the period from the Effective Date (as defined
below) until August 8, 2011 (the Forbearance Period), each of the Administrative Agent and the
Lender hereby agrees to forbear (the Forbearance) from exercising its rights and remedies under

provided, however, that upon the occurrence of any Event of Default other than the
Forbearance Default, including the Events of Defaults set forth in Section 1(c) hereof, the
Forbearance Period shall automatically and immediately terminate, and the Administrative Agent and
the Lender shall be entitled to exercise any and all of their rights and remedies under the Credit
Agreement, the other Loan Documents and applicable law, without further notice other than as
required therein. Upon termination of the Forbearance Period, (A) the forbearance shall
automatically terminate and be of no further force or effect without any further action by the
Lender, (B) the Forbearance Default is, without further action, reinstated and shall have the same
force and effect as if the Forbearance had not been agreed to by the parties hereto and (C) subject
to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Loan Documents and applicable law, the Lender may
thereafter, without limitation, sue, ask for or demand from the Loan Parties payment of the
Obligations due and payable to such Lender, in whole or in part, and otherwise enforce any of its
rights and remedies (including rights of acceleration and foreclosure) provided for under the
Credit Agreement, the Loan Documents or applicable law against any party. Each of the Loan Parties
party hereto agrees that, subject to the agreement of the Lender to forbear from exercising certain
of their rights and remedies as and to the extent expressly set forth in this Agreement, all rights
and remedies of the Lender under the Credit Agreement, the Loan Documents or applicable law with
respect to such Loan Party shall continue to be available to the Lender from and after the
Effective Date.


(ii) It is understood and agreed that interest shall accrue from the Effective Date through
the remainder of the Forbearance Period on the outstanding Obligations at the applicable default
rates provided for pursuant to the Credit Agreement.


(c) Additional Events of Default. The following events shall constitute Events of
Default under the terms of the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents:

(v) any representation or warranty made or deemed made by any Loan Party herein or any

8. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the laws of the State of New York without giving effect to the conflict of laws provisions
thereof.


9. Limitation. Each party hereto hereby agrees that this Agreement does not impose on
Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. affirmative obligations or indemnities not existing, as of the date of
its petition commencing its proceeding under chapter 11 of the United States Code, and that could
give rise to administrative expense claims.


10. Indemnity. The Borrower, Holdings and the other Loan Parties further agree,
jointly and severally, to defend, protect, indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent and
the Lender, each of their respective Affiliates and their respective officers, directors,

liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, claims, costs,
expenses of any kind or nature whatsoever (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel for such Indemnitees in connection with any investigative, administrative or
judicial proceeding, whether or not such Indemnitees shall be designated as a party thereto),
imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against such Indemnitees in any manner relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or any other Loan Document (collectively the Indemnified Matters);
provided, however, that neither the Borrower, Holdings or any Loan Party shall have
an obligation to an Indemnitee hereunder with respect to Indemnified Matters caused or resulting
from (a) a dispute among the Lender or a dispute between the Lender and the Administrative Agent or
(b) the willful misconduct or gross negligence of such Indemnitee. If the undertaking to
indemnify, pay and hold harmless set forth in the preceding sentence may be unenforceable because
it violates any law or public policy, the Borrower, Holdings and the other Loan Parties shall
contribute the maximum portion which it is permitted to pay and satisfy under the applicable law,
to the payment and satisfaction of all Indemnified Matters incurred by Indemnities. This Section
10 shall survive the payment of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement or any other
Loan Document.
