Exhibit 10.13.1



NEWFIELD EXPLORATION COMPANY
RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT
(Amended and Restated Effective February 7, 2008)


THIS RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT (this Agreement) is made as of February 7, 2008 (the Date
of Grant) and is by and between Newfield Exploration Company (the Company) and
                                         (Employee).



1. Grant.



     (a) Restricted Stock Units. Pursuant to the Newfield Exploration Company 2007 Omnibus Stock
Plan (as amended from time to time, the Plan), this Agreement evidences the grant by the Company
of an award of                      restricted stock units to Employee subject to the Forfeiture Restrictions
described in Section 2(a) below (the Restricted Stock Units). Each Restricted Stock Unit
represents the right to receive one share of Common Stock as of the date on which the Restricted
Stock Unit is payable.


     (b) Plan Incorporated. Employee acknowledges receipt of a copy of the Plan and agrees that
the Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Plan, which
terms and conditions are incorporated herein for all purposes. Capitalized terms used but not
defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Plan.


     (c) No Rights as a Stockholder. Restricted Stock Units are not actual shares of Common Stock
and Employee will have no rights as a stockholder with respect to any Restricted Stock Units,
including no right to vote on matters submitted to stockholders of the Company and no right to
receive any dividends declared or paid on Common Stock. Employee will be a general and unsecured
creditor of the Company and will have no direct or secured claim in any specific assets of the
Company.

2. Restrictions. Employee hereby accepts the Restricted Stock Units and agrees with
respect thereto as follows:



     (a) Forfeiture Restrictions. Except as otherwise provided in Paragraph X of the Plan, (i) the
Restricted Stock Units may not be sold, assigned, pledged, exchanged, hypothecated or otherwise
transferred or disposed of to the extent then subject to Forfeiture Restrictions and (ii) if, prior
to the fourth year anniversary of the Date of Grant, Employees employment with the Company is
terminated for any reason (including as described in the last sentence of Paragraph XII(b) of the
Plan) other than (A) a Separation From Service by reason of death or Disability of Employee or (B)
a Qualified Retirement, Employee shall, for no consideration, forfeit to the Company all Restricted
Stock Units to the extent then subject to Forfeiture Restrictions. The prohibition against
transfer and the obligation to forfeit and surrender the Restricted Stock Units to the Company as
provided in this Section 2(a) are herein referred to as Forfeiture Restrictions. Forfeiture
Restrictions shall be binding upon and enforceable against any permitted transferee of the
Restricted Stock Units.


 




 



     (b) Death. If not previously forfeited, Forfeiture Restrictions with respect to the
Restricted Stock Units shall lapse on the date of the Employees termination of employment with the
Company by reason of Employees death.


     (c) Disability. If not previously forfeited, Forfeiture Restrictions with respect to the
Restricted Stock Units shall lapse on the date Employee incurs a Separation From Service with the
Company by reason of Employees Disability if Employee is not a Specified Employee or on the date
that is six months following Employees Separation From Service if Employee is a Specified
Employee; provided, however, that if Employee dies before the expiration of such six-month delay
period (if applicable) then all remaining Forfeiture Restrictions shall immediately lapse on the
date of Employees death.


     (d) Qualified Retirement. If Employee incurs a Separation From Service as a result of
Employees Qualified Retirement, if not previously forfeited, Forfeiture Restrictions shall lapse
with respect to that number of Restricted Stock Units equal to (i) the Pro Rata Units minus (ii)
the number of Restricted Stock Units with respect to which the Forfeiture Restrictions have
previously lapsed pursuant to Section 2(f) on the date Employee incurs a Separation From Service if
Employee is not a Specified Employee or on the date that is six months following Employees
Separation From Service if Employee is a Specified Employee; provided, however, that if Employee
dies before the expiration of such six-month delay period (if applicable) then all remaining
Forfeiture Restrictions shall immediately lapse on the date of Employees death.


     (e) Change of Control. The impact of a Change of Control of the Company on the Restricted
Stock Units shall be determined under the provisions of this Section 2(e) rather than under any
provisions of the Plan dealing with vesting or the lapse of Forfeiture Restrictions. If a Change
of Control of the Company occurs on or before the fourth anniversary of the Date of Grant and you
do not terminate employment with the Company and all direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries
of the Company before the date the Change of Control of the Company occurs, then all remaining
Forfeiture Restrictions shall lapse on the date the Change of Control of the Company occurs if the
Change of Control of the Company qualifies as a change in the ownership or effective control of the
corporation within the meaning of Section 409A.


     (f) Continuous Employment. If not previously forfeited, Forfeiture Restrictions with respect
to the Restricted Stock Units shall lapse on the indicated anniversary of the Date of Grant in
accordance with the following schedule:

outstanding Restricted Stock Units no longer subject to Forfeiture Restrictions.


5. Community Interest of Spouse. The community interest, if any, of any spouse of Employee
in any of the Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to all of the terms, conditions and
restrictions of this Agreement and the Plan, and shall be forfeited and surrendered to the Company
upon the occurrence of any of the events requiring Employees interest in such Restricted Stock
Units to be so forfeited and surrendered pursuant to this Agreement.

which the Company is operating or (ii) with respect to which the Company is actively considering
for operations, in the case of clause (b) only, as of the date hereof.


     Person means any individual, partnership, corporation, limited liability company, trust,
incorporated or unincorporated organization or association or other legal entity of any kind.


     Term means the period from the date hereof and the date on which Retiring Employee reaches

Persons Affiliates or (ii) own securities issued by the Company.


     3. Specific Performance; Injunctive Relief. Retiring Employee specifically

     4. Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal

economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith

provisions of this Agreement shall be binding unless the same shall be in writing and duly executed
by the Company and Retiring Employee, except that any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement
may be waived in writing at any time by the party that is entitled to the benefits of such waived
terms or provisions. No single waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
to or shall constitute, absent an express statement otherwise, a continuous waiver of such
provision or a waiver of any other provision hereof (whether or not similar).


     6. Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative. No failure or delay on the
part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder shall impair such right or be
construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any covenant or agreement herein,

thereof or of any other right. All rights and remedies existing under this Agreement are
cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.


     7. No Affect on Retiring Employees Obligations. This Agreement shall in no way

other for breach of any provision hereof, the losing party shall be liable for the costs and
expenses of the prevailing party, including without limitation its reasonable attorneys fees.
