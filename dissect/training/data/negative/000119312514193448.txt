Agreement be amended and restated in its entirety, (II) the Borrower has requested that the Lenders extend credit in the form of Loans made available to the Borrower and at any time and from time to time after the Closing Date subject to the
Available Commitment, (III) the Borrower has requested that the Letter of Credit Issuer issue Letters of Credit (subject to the Available Commitment) at any time and from time to time prior to the L/C Maturity Date, in an aggregate Stated Amount at
any time outstanding not in excess of $100,000,000 and (III) the Borrower has requested that the Swingline Lender extend credit in the form of Swingline Loans (subject to the Available Commitment) at any time and from time to time prior to the

THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows: 
SECTION 1. Definitions 
1.1 Defined Terms.  (a)
As used herein, the following terms shall have the meanings specified in this Section 1.1 unless the context otherwise requires (it being understood that defined terms in this Agreement shall include in the singular number the plural and
in the plural the singular):  ABR shall mean for any day a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of
(a) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus  1⁄2 of 1%, (b) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time
by the Administrative Agent as its prime rate and (c) the LIBOR Rate for a one-month Interest Period on such day (or if such day is not a Business Day, the immediately preceding Business Day) plus 1.0%; provided that,
for the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of calculating the LIBOR Rate pursuant to clause (c) above, the LIBOR Rate for any day shall be based on the rate per 
   1 





 
annum determined by the Administrative Agent at approximately 11:00 a.m. (London time) on such day by reference to the rate appearing on the Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page (or any successor page or
any successor service, or any substitute page or substitute for such service, providing rate quotations comparable to the Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page, as determined by the Administrative Agent from time to time for purposes of providing quotations
of interest rates applicable to dollar deposits in the London interbank market) for a period equal to one-month. The prime rate is a rate set by the Administrative Agent based upon various factors, including the Administrative
Agents costs and desired return, general economic conditions and other factors, and is used as a reference point for pricing some loans, which may be priced at, above, or below such announced rate. Any change in the ABR due to a change in such
rate announced by the Administrative Agent, in the Federal Funds Effective Rate or in the one-month LIBOR Rate shall take effect at the opening of business on the day specified in the public announcement of such change. 
ABR Loan shall mean each Loan bearing interest based on the ABR. 
Additional Lender shall have the meaning provided in Section 2.16(a). 
Adjusted Total Commitment shall mean, at any time, the Total Commitment less the aggregate amount of Commitments of
all Defaulting Lenders.  Administrative Agent shall mean JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as the administrative agent for the
Lenders under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, or any successor administrative agent appointed in accordance with the provisions of Section 12.9. 
Administrative Agents Office shall mean the Administrative Agents address and, as appropriate, account as set
forth on Schedule 13.2, or such other address or account as the Administrative Agent may from time to time notify in writing to the Borrower and the Lenders. 
Administrative Questionnaire shall mean, for each Lender, an administrative questionnaire in a form approved by the
Administrative Agent.  Affiliate shall mean, with respect to any Person, any other Person directly or indirectly
controlling, controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with such Person. A Person shall be deemed to control another Person if such Person possesses, directly or indirectly, the power to direct or cause the direction of the
management and policies of such other Person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise. Controlling (controlling) and controlled shall have meanings correlative thereto. 
Agreement shall mean this Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise
modified from time to time.  Applicable Equity Amount shall mean, at any time (the Applicable Equity Amount
Reference Time), an amount equal to, without duplication,  (a) the amount of any proceeds of an equity issuance received by the
Borrower during the period from and including the Business Day immediately following the Closing Date, through and including the Applicable Equity Amount Reference Time, but excluding all proceeds from the issuance of Disqualified Stock;
minus 
   2 





 (b) the sum, without duplication, of: 
(i) the aggregate amount of any Investments made by the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to Section 10.5(h)(B) after
the Closing Date, and prior to the Applicable Equity Amount Reference Time;  (ii) the aggregate amount of any Restricted Payments made by
the Borrower pursuant to Section 10.6(i) after the Closing Date, and prior to the Applicable Equity Amount Reference Time; and 
(iii) the aggregate amount of prepayments, repurchases, redemptions and defeasances made by the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary pursuant
to Section 10.7(c)(iii) after the Closing Date and prior to the Applicable Equity Amount Reference Time.  Applicable
Margin shall mean, for any day, with respect to any ABR Loan or LIBOR Loan, as the case may be,  (a) at any time other than
during an Investment Grade Period, the rate per annum set forth in the grid below based upon the Borrowing Base Utilization Percentage in effect on such day:

(ii) Each Lender may at its option make any LIBOR Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such
Loan, provided that (i) any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay such Loan and (ii) in exercising such option, such Lender shall use its reasonable efforts to minimize any increased costs
to the Borrower resulting therefrom (which obligation of the Lender shall not require it to take, or refrain from taking, actions that it determines would result in increased costs for which it will not be compensated hereunder or that it determines
would be otherwise disadvantageous to it and in the event of such request for costs for which compensation is provided under this Agreement, the provisions of Section 2.10 shall apply).

Lender pro rata based on each Lenders Commitment Percentage, and the proceeds thereof shall be applied directly to the Swingline Lender to repay the Swingline Lender for such outstanding Swingline Loans. Each Lender hereby
irrevocably agrees to make such Loans upon one Business Days notice pursuant to each Mandatory Borrowing in the amount and in the manner specified in the preceding sentence and on the date specified to it in writing by the Swingline Lender

that, in the sole judgment of the Swingline Lender, any Mandatory Borrowing cannot for any reason be made on the date otherwise required above (including as a result of the commencement of a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code in respect of the
Borrower), each Lender hereby agrees that it shall forthwith purchase from the Swingline Lender (without recourse or warranty) such participation of the outstanding Swingline Loans as shall be necessary to cause the Lenders to share in such
Swingline Loans ratably based upon their respective Commitment Percentages, provided that all principal and interest payable on such Swingline Loans shall be for the account of the Swingline Lender until the date the respective participation is

Lender will make available its pro rata portion of each Borrowing requested to be made on such date in the manner provided below; provided that on the Closing Date, such funds shall be made available by 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) or
such earlier time as may be agreed among the Lenders, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent for the purpose of consummating the Transactions; provided further that all Swingline Loans shall be made available in the full amount thereof by

available to the Borrower, by depositing or wiring to an account as designated by the Borrower in the Borrowing Notice to the Administrative Agent the aggregate of the amounts so made available in Dollars. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have
been notified by any Lender prior to the date of any such Borrowing that such Lender does not intend to make available to the Administrative Agent its portion of the Borrowing or Borrowings to be made on such date, the Administrative Agent may
assume that such Lender has made such amount available to the Administrative Agent on such date of Borrowing, and the Administrative Agent, in reliance upon such assumption, may (in its sole discretion and without any obligation to do so) make
available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender and the Administrative Agent has made available such amount to the Borrower, the Administrative
Agent shall be entitled to recover such corresponding amount from such Lender. If such Lender does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agents demand therefor the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the
Borrower and the Borrower shall immediately pay such corresponding amount to the Administrative Agent in Dollars. The Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover from such Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, interest on such
corresponding amount in respect of each day from the date such corresponding amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower to the date such corresponding amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent, at a rate per annum
equal to (i) if paid by such Lender, the Overnight Rate or (ii) if paid by the Borrower, the then-applicable rate of interest or fees, calculated in accordance with Section 2.8, for the respective Loans. 
(c) Nothing in this Section 2.4 shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its commitments hereunder or
to prejudice any rights that the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder (it being understood, however, that no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to fulfill its
commitments hereunder).  2.5 Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt.

principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender or the Swingline Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from the Borrower and each
Lenders share thereof. 
   40 





 (d) The entries made in the Register and accounts and subaccounts maintained pursuant to
clauses (b) and (c) of this Section 2.5 shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law, be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations of the Borrower therein recorded;
provided, however, that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such account, such Register or such subaccount, as applicable, or any error therein, shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the
Borrower to repay (with applicable interest) the Loans made to the Borrower by such Lender in accordance with the terms of this Agreement 
(e) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note substantially in the form of Exhibit I hereto. In such
event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns). Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such
promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 13.6) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such
promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).  2.6 Conversions and Continuations. 
(a) Subject to the penultimate sentence of this clause (a), (i) the Borrower shall have the option on any Business Day to
convert all or a portion equal to at least $1,000,000 (and in multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof) of the outstanding principal amount of Loans of one Type into a Borrowing or Borrowings of another Type and (ii) the Borrower shall have the
option on any Business Day to continue the outstanding principal amount of any LIBOR Loans as LIBOR Loans for an additional Interest Period; provided that (A) no partial conversion of LIBOR Loans shall reduce the outstanding principal
amount of LIBOR Loans made pursuant to a single Borrowing to less than $1,000,000, (B) ABR Loans may not be converted into LIBOR Loans if an Event of Default is in existence on the date of the conversion and the Administrative Agent has or the
Majority Lenders have determined in its or their sole discretion not to permit such conversion, (C) LIBOR Loans may not be continued as LIBOR Loans for an additional Interest Period if an Event of Default is in existence on the date of the
proposed continuation and the Administrative Agent has or the Majority Lenders have determined in its or their sole discretion not to permit such continuation, and (D) Borrowings resulting from conversions pursuant to this
Section 2.6 shall be limited in number as provided in Section 2.2. Each such conversion or continuation shall be effected by the Borrower by giving the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agents Office prior to
1:00 p.m. (New York City time) at least (1) three Business Days, in the case of a continuation of or conversion to LIBOR Loans or (2) the date of conversion, in the case of a conversion into ABR Loans, prior written notice (or
telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) (each, a Notice of Conversion or Continuation) specifying the Loans to be so converted or continued, the Type of Loans to be converted into or continued and, if such Loans are to be
converted into or continued as LIBOR Loans, the Interest Period to be initially applicable thereto (if no Interest Period is selected, the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one months duration). The Administrative
Agent shall give each applicable Lender notice as promptly as practicable of any such proposed conversion or continuation affecting any of its Loans. 
(b) If any Event of Default is in existence at the time of any proposed continuation of any LIBOR Loans and the Administrative Agent has or
the Majority Lenders have determined in its or their sole discretion not to permit such continuation, such LIBOR Loans shall be automatically converted on the last day of the current Interest Period into ABR Loans. If upon the expiration of any
Interest Period in respect of LIBOR Loans, the Borrower has failed to elect a new Interest Period to be applicable thereto as provided in clause (a) above, the Borrower shall be deemed to have elected to convert such Borrowing of LIBOR
Loans into a Borrowing of ABR Loans, effective as of the expiration date of such current Interest Period. 
   41 





 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Borrower may deliver a Notice of
Conversion or Continuation pursuant to which the Borrower elects to irrevocably continue the outstanding principal amount of any Revolving Loans subject to an interest rate Hedge Agreement as LIBOR Loans for each Interest Period until the expiration
of the term of such applicable Hedge Agreement; provided that any Notice of Conversion or Continuation delivered pursuant to this Section 2.6(c) shall include a schedule attaching the relevant interest rate Hedge Agreement or related
trade confirmation.  2.7 Pro Rata Borrowings. Each Borrowing of Loans under this Agreement shall be made by the Lenders pro rata on
the basis of their then applicable Commitment Percentages. It is understood that (a) no Lender shall be responsible for any default by any other Lender in its obligation to make Loans hereunder and that each Lender severally but not jointly
shall be obligated to make the Loans provided to be made by it hereunder, regardless of the failure of any other Lender to fulfill its commitments hereunder and (b) failure by a Lender to perform any of its obligations under any of the Credit
Documents shall not release any Person from performance of its obligation under any Credit Document.  2.8 Interest. 
(a) The unpaid principal amount of each ABR Loan shall bear interest from the date of the Borrowing thereof until maturity (whether by
acceleration or otherwise) at a rate per annum that shall at all times be the Applicable Margin plus the ABR, in each case, in effect from time to time. 
(b) The unpaid principal amount of each LIBOR Loan shall bear interest from the date of the Borrowing thereof until maturity thereof (whether
by acceleration or otherwise) at a rate per annum that shall at all times be the Applicable Margin plus the relevant LIBOR Rate, in each case, in effect from time to time. 
(c) If all or a portion of (i) the principal amount of any Loan or (ii) any interest payable thereon shall not be paid when due
(whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear interest at a rate per annum that is (the Default Rate) (A) in the case of overdue principal, the rate that would otherwise be
applicable thereto plus 2% or (B) in the case of any overdue interest, to the extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law, the rate described in Section 2.8(a) plus 2% from the date of such non-payment to the
date on which such amount is paid in full (after as well as before judgment).  (d) Interest on each Loan shall accrue from and including
the date of any Borrowing to but excluding the date of any repayment thereof and shall be payable in Dollars; provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same date on which it is made shall bear interest for one day. Except as provided
below, interest shall be payable (i) in respect of each ABR Loan, quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December, (ii) in respect of each LIBOR Loan, on the last day of each Interest Period
applicable thereto and, in the case of an Interest Period in excess of three months, on each date occurring at three-month intervals after the first day of such Interest Period, (iii) in respect of each Loan, (A) on any prepayment (on the
amount prepaid), (B) at maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) and (C) after such maturity, on demand.  (e) All
computations of interest hereunder shall be made in accordance with Section 5.5.  (f) The Administrative Agent, upon
determining the interest rate for any Borrowing of LIBOR Loans, shall promptly notify the Borrower and the relevant Lenders thereof. Each such determination shall, absent clearly demonstrable error, be final and conclusive and binding on all parties
hereto. 
   42 





 2.9 Interest Periods. At the time the Borrower gives a Notice of Borrowing or Notice of
Conversion or Continuation in respect of the making of, or conversion into or continuation as, a Borrowing of LIBOR Loans in accordance with Section 2.6(a), the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent written notice (or telephonic
notice promptly confirmed in writing) of the Interest Period applicable to such Borrowing, which Interest Period shall, at the option of the Borrower be a one, two, three or six or (if available to all the Lenders making such LIBOR Loans as
determined by such Lenders in good faith based on prevailing market conditions) a 12-month period or any shorter period requested by the Borrower; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the initial Interest Period beginning on the
Closing Date may be for a period less than one month if agreed upon by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above: 
(a) the initial Interest Period for any Borrowing of LIBOR Loans shall commence on the date of such Borrowing (including the date of any
conversion from a Borrowing of ABR Loans) and each Interest Period occurring thereafter in respect of such Borrowing shall commence on the day on which the next preceding Interest Period expires; 
(b) if any Interest Period relating to a Borrowing of LIBOR Loans begins on the last Business Day of a calendar month or begins on a day for
which there is no numerically corresponding day in the calendar month at the end of such Interest Period, such Interest Period shall end on the last Business Day of the calendar month at the end of such Interest Period; 
(c) if any Interest Period would otherwise expire on a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Period shall expire on the next
succeeding Business Day; provided that, if any Interest Period in respect of a LIBOR Loan would otherwise expire on a day that is not a Business Day, but is a day of the month after which no further Business Day occurs in such month, such
Interest Period shall expire on the next preceding Business Day; and  (d) the Borrower shall not be entitled to elect any Interest Period
in respect of any LIBOR Loan if such Interest Period would extend beyond the Maturity Date.  2.10 Increased Costs, Illegality, Etc.
 (a) In the event that (x) in the case of clause (i) below, the Majority Lenders or (y) in the case of
clauses (ii) and (iii) below, any Lender, shall have reasonably determined (which determination shall, absent clearly demonstrable error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto): 
(i) on any date for determining the LIBOR Rate for any Interest Period that (A) deposits in the principal amounts of the Loans comprising
such LIBOR Borrowing are not generally available in the relevant market, (B) by reason of any changes arising on or after the Closing Date affecting the interbank LIBOR market, adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining the
applicable interest rate on the basis provided for in the definition of LIBOR Rate, or (C) the LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in
such Borrowing for such Interest Period; or  (ii) that, due to a Change in Law occurring at any time or after the Closing Date, which
Change in Law shall (A) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender,
(B) subject any Lender to any Tax with respect to any Credit Document or any LIBOR Loan made by it (other than (i) Taxes indemnifiable under Section 5.4, 
   43 





 
or (ii) Excluded Taxes), or (C) impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or LIBOR Loans made by such Lender,
which results in the cost to such Lender of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining LIBOR Loans or participating in Letters of Credit (in each case hereunder) increasing by an amount which such Lender reasonably deems material or the
amounts received or receivable by such Lender hereunder with respect to the foregoing shall be reduced; or  (iii) at any time, that the
making or continuance of any LIBOR Loan has become unlawful as a result of compliance by such Lender in good faith with any Requirement of Law (or would conflict with any such Requirement of Law not having the force of law even though the failure to
comply therewith would not be unlawful);  then, and in any such event, such Lenders (or the Administrative Agent, in the case of clause (i)
above) shall within a reasonable time thereafter give notice (if by telephone, confirmed in writing) to the Borrower and to the Administrative Agent of such determination (which notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each of
the other Lenders). Thereafter (x) in the case of clause (i) above, LIBOR Loans shall no longer be available until such time as the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to
such notice by the Administrative Agent no longer exist (which notice the Administrative Agent agrees to give at such time when such circumstances no longer exist), and any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion given by the Borrower with
respect to LIBOR Loans that have not yet been incurred shall be deemed rescinded by the Borrower, (y) in the case of clause (ii) above, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender, promptly (but no later than fifteen days) after receipt
of written demand therefor such additional amounts as shall be required to compensate such Lender for such increased costs or reductions in amounts receivable hereunder (it being agreed that a written notice as to the additional amounts owed to such
Lender, showing in reasonable detail the basis for the calculation thereof, submitted to the Borrower by such Lender shall, absent clearly demonstrable error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto) and (z) in the case of
clause (iii) above, the Borrower shall take one of the actions specified in Section 2.10(b) as promptly as possible and, in any event, within the time period required by applicable Requirements of Law. 
(b) At any time that any LIBOR Loan is affected by the circumstances described in Section 2.10(a)(ii) or (iii), the
Borrower may (and in the case of a LIBOR Loan affected pursuant to Section 2.10(a)(iii) shall) either (i) if the affected LIBOR Loan is then being made pursuant to a Borrowing, cancel such Borrowing by giving the Administrative
Agent telephonic notice (confirmed promptly in writing) thereof on the same date that the Borrower was notified by a Lender pursuant to Section 2.10(a)(ii) or (iii) or (ii) if the affected LIBOR Loan is then outstanding,
upon at least three Business Days notice to the Administrative Agent, require the affected Lender to convert each such LIBOR Loan into an ABR Loan; provided that if more than one Lender is affected at any time, then all affected Lenders
must be treated in the same manner pursuant to this Section 2.10(b).  (c) If, after the Closing Date, any Change in Law
relating to capital adequacy or liquidity requirements of any Lender or compliance by any Lender or its parent with any Change in Law relating to capital adequacy or liquidity requirements occurring after the Closing Date, has or would have the
effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders or its parents capital or assets as a consequence of such Lenders commitments or obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender or its parent could have achieved
but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lenders or its parents policies with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity requirements), then from time to time, promptly (but in any event no later than fifteen days) after
written demand by such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or its parent for such reduction, it being understood and agreed,
however, that a 
   44 





 
Lender shall not be entitled to such compensation as a result of such Lenders compliance with, or pursuant to any request or directive to comply with, any applicable Requirement of Law as
in effect on the Closing Date (except as otherwise set forth in the definition of Change in Law). Each Lender, upon determining in good faith that any additional amounts will be payable pursuant to this Section 2.10(c), will give prompt
written notice thereof to the Borrower, which notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis of the calculation of such additional amounts, although the failure to give any such notice shall not, subject to Section 2.13, release
or diminish the Borrowers obligations to pay additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.10(c) upon receipt of such notice. 
2.11 Compensation. If (a) any payment of principal of any LIBOR Loan is made by the Borrower to or for the account of a Lender
other than on the last day of the Interest Period for such LIBOR Loan as a result of a payment or conversion pursuant to Sections 2.5, 2.6, 2.10, 5.1, 5.2 or 13.7, as a result of acceleration of the
maturity of the Loans pursuant to Section 11 or for any other reason, (b) any Borrowing of LIBOR Loans is not made on the date specified in a Notice of Borrowing, (c) any ABR Loan is not converted into a LIBOR Loan on the date
specified in a Notice of Conversion or Continuation, (d) any LIBOR Loan is not continued as a LIBOR Loan on the date specified in a Notice of Conversion or Continuation or (e) any prepayment of principal of any LIBOR Loan is not made as a
result of a withdrawn notice of prepayment pursuant to Section 5.1 or 5.2, the Borrower shall after the Borrowers receipt of a written request by such Lender (which request shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for
requesting such amount), pay to the Administrative Agent (within fifteen days after such request) for the account of such Lender any amounts required to compensate such Lender for any additional losses, costs or expenses that such Lender may
reasonably incur as a result of such payment, failure to convert, failure to continue or failure to prepay, including any loss, cost or expense (excluding loss of anticipated profits) actually incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of
deposits or other funds acquired by any Lender to fund or maintain such LIBOR Loan.  2.12 Change of Lending Office. Each Lender
agrees that, upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 2.10(a)(ii), 2.10(a)(iii), 2.10(c), 3.5 or 5.4 with respect to such Lender, it will, if requested by the Borrower use
reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to designate another lending office for any Loans affected by such event; provided that such designation is made on such terms that such Lender and its lending
office suffer no economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, with the object of avoiding the consequence of the event giving rise to the operation of any such Section. Nothing in this Section 2.12 shall affect or postpone any of the
obligations of the Borrower or the right of any Lender provided in Section 2.10, 3.5 or 5.4.  2.13 Notice of
Certain Costs. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent any notice required by Section 2.10, 2.11, 3.5 or 5.4 is given by any Lender more than 180 days after such Lender has
knowledge (or should have had knowledge) of the occurrence of the event giving rise to the additional cost, reduction in amounts, loss, tax or other additional amounts described in such Sections, such Lender shall not be entitled to compensation
under Section 2.10, 2.11, 3.5 or 5.4, as the case may be, for any such amounts incurred or accruing prior to the 181st day prior to the giving of such notice to
the Borrower; provided that if the circumstance giving rise to such claim is retroactive, then such 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. 
2.14 Borrowing Base. 
(a) Initial Borrowing Base. For the period from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the first Redetermination Date, the
amount of the Borrowing Base shall be $3,250,000,000. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrowing Base may be subject to further adjustments from time to time pursuant to Section 2.14(e). 
   45 





 (b) Scheduled and Interim Redeterminations. The Borrowing Base shall be redetermined
annually in accordance with this Section 2.14 (a Scheduled Redetermination), and, subject to Section 2.14(d), such redetermined Borrowing Base shall become effective and applicable to the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent, the Letter of Credit Issuers and the Lenders on May 1st of each year, commencing May 1, 2015. In addition, the Borrower may at any time (including prior to the
first Scheduled Redetermination date of May 1, 2015), by notifying the Administrative Agent thereof, not more than once between Scheduled Redeterminations, and the Administrative Agent, following the first Scheduled Redetermination date of
May 1, 2015, may, at the direction of the Required Lenders, by notifying the Borrower thereof, not more than once between Scheduled Redeterminations, in each case elect to cause the Borrowing Base to be redetermined between Scheduled
Redeterminations (an Interim Redetermination) in accordance with this Section 2.14. In addition to, and not including and/or limited by the Interim Redeterminations allowed above, the Borrower may, by notifying the
Administrative Agent thereof, at any time between Scheduled Redeterminations, request additional Interim Redeterminations of the Borrowing Base in the event it acquires Oil and Gas Properties with Proved Reserves which are to be Borrowing Base
Properties having a PV-9 (calculated at the time of acquisition) in excess of 10% of the Borrowing Base in effect immediately prior to such acquisition. 
(c) Scheduled and Interim Redetermination Procedure. 
(i) Each Scheduled Redetermination and each Interim Redetermination shall be effectuated as follows: Upon receipt by the Administrative Agent
of (A) the Reserve Report, and (B) such other reports, data and supplemental information, including the information provided pursuant to Section 9.13(b), as may, from time to time, be reasonably requested by the Required
Lenders (the Reserve Report and such other reports, data and supplemental information being the Engineering Reports), the Administrative Agent shall evaluate the information contained in the Engineering Reports and shall in good
faith propose a new Borrowing Base (the Proposed Borrowing Base) based upon such information and such other information (including the status of title information with respect to the Borrowing Base Properties as described in the
Engineering Reports and the existence of any Hedge Agreements or any other Indebtedness) as the Administrative Agent deems appropriate in good faith in accordance with its usual and customary oil and gas lending criteria as it exists at the
particular time.  (ii) The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the Proposed Borrowing Base (the
Proposed Borrowing Base Notice):  (A) in the case of a Scheduled Redetermination (1) if the Administrative Agent
shall have received the Engineering Reports required to be delivered by the Borrower pursuant to Sections 9.13(a) and (b) in a timely manner, then on or before April 15th
of such year following the date of delivery or (2) if the Administrative Agent shall not have received the Engineering Reports required to be delivered by the Borrower pursuant to Sections 9.13(a) and (b) in a timely
manner, then promptly after the Administrative Agent has received complete Engineering Reports from the Borrower and has had a reasonable opportunity to determine the Proposed Borrowing Base in accordance with Section 2.14(c)(i); and
 (B) in the case of an Interim Redetermination, promptly, and in any event, within 15 days after the Administrative Agent has received
the required Engineering Reports.  (iii) Any Proposed Borrowing Base that would increase the Borrowing Base then in effect must be
approved or deemed to have been approved by the Borrowing Base Required Lenders in each such Lenders sole discretion and consistent with each such Lenders normal and customary oil and gas lending criteria as it exists at the particular
time as provided in this Section 2.14(c)(iii) and any Proposed Borrowing Base that would decrease or maintain the Borrowing Base then in effect must be 
   46 





 
approved or be deemed to have been approved by Lenders constituting at least the Required Lenders in each such Lenders sole discretion and consistent with each such Lenders normal and
customary oil and gas lending criteria as it exists at the particular time as provided in this Section 2.14(c)(iii). Upon receipt of the Proposed Borrowing Base Notice, each Lender shall have 15 days to agree with the Proposed Borrowing
Base or disagree with the Proposed Borrowing Base by proposing an alternate Borrowing Base. If at the end of such 15-day period, any Lender has not communicated its approval or disapproval in writing to the Administrative Agent, such silence shall
be deemed to be an approval of the Proposed Borrowing Base. If, at the end of such 15-day period, the Borrowing Base Required Lenders, in the case of a Proposed Borrowing Base that would increase the Borrowing Base then in effect, or the Required
Lenders, in the case of a Proposed Borrowing Base that would decrease or maintain the Borrowing Base then in effect, have approved or deemed to have approved, as aforesaid, then the Proposed Borrowing Base shall become the new Borrowing Base,
effective on the date specified in Section 2.14(d). If, however, at the end of such 15-day period, the Borrowing Base Required Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable, have not approved or deemed to have approved, as aforesaid,
then the Administrative Agent shall promptly thereafter poll the Lenders to ascertain the highest Borrowing Base then acceptable to the Borrowing Base Required Lenders (in the case of any increase to the Borrowing Base) or a number of Lenders
sufficient to constitute the Required Lenders (in any other case) and such amount shall become the new Borrowing Base, effective on the date specified in Section 2.14(d). It is expressly understood that the Administrative Agent and
Lenders have no obligation to designate the Borrowing Base at any particular amount, except in the exercise of their discretion, whether in relation to the Total Commitment, the Maximum Aggregate Amount or otherwise. 
(d) Effectiveness of a Redetermined Borrowing Base. Subject to Section 2.14(f), after a redetermined Borrowing Base is
approved or is deemed to have been approved by the Borrowing Base Required Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable, pursuant to Section 2.14(c)(iii), the Administrative Agent shall promptly thereafter notify the Borrower and the
Lenders of the amount of the redetermined Borrowing Base (the New Borrowing Base Notice), and such amount shall become the new Borrowing Base, effective and applicable to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Letter of
Credit Issuers and the Lenders:  (i) in the case of a Scheduled Redetermination, (A) if the Administrative Agent shall have received
the Engineering Reports required to be delivered by the Borrower pursuant to Sections 9.13(a) and (b) in a timely and complete manner, on the May 1st following such notice,
or (B) if the Administrative Agent shall not have received the Engineering Reports required to be delivered by the Borrower pursuant to Sections 9.13(a) and (b) in a timely and complete manner, then on the Business Day
next succeeding delivery of such New Borrowing Base Notice; and  (ii) in the case of an Interim Redetermination, on the Business Day next
succeeding delivery of such New Borrowing Base Notice.  Subject to Section 2.14(f), such amount shall then become the
Borrowing Base until the next Scheduled Redetermination Date, the next Interim Redetermination Date or the next adjustment to the Borrowing Base under Section 2.14(e). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Scheduled Redetermination or
Interim Redetermination shall become effective until the New Borrowing Base Notice related thereto is received by the Borrower.  (e)
Reduction of Borrowing Base Upon Asset Dispositions or Termination of Hedge Positions. If (i) (1) the Borrower or one of the other Credit Parties Disposes of Oil and Gas Properties or Disposes of any Stock or Stock Equivalents in
any Restricted Subsidiary owning Oil and Gas Properties, and such Disposition involves Borrowing Base Properties included in the most recently delivered Reserve Report, or (2) the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary shall unwind, terminate or
create any off-setting 
   47 





 
positions in respect of any commodity hedge positions (whether evidenced by a floor, put or Hedge Agreement) upon which (i) the Lenders relied in determining the Borrowing Base, and
(ii) the sum of (1) in the case of clause (i)(1) the aggregate PV-9 (calculated at the time of such Disposition) of all such Borrowing Base Properties Disposed of since the later of (A) the last Scheduled Redetermination Date and
(B) the last adjustment of the Borrowing Base made pursuant to this Section 2.14(e), and (2) in the case of clause (i)(2), the Hedge PV (as calculated at the time of any such unwind, termination or creation of off-setting
positions) of such unwound, terminated and/or offsetting positions (after taking into account any other Hedge Agreement, executed contemporaneously with the taking of such actions) during such period, collectively, exceeds 10% of the then-effective
Borrowing Base, then, after the Administrative Agent has received the notice required to be delivered by the Borrower pursuant to Section 10.4(b) or (l) no later than one Business Day after the date of consummation of any
such Disposition, unwind, termination or off-set, as the case may be, the Required Lenders shall have the right to adjust the Borrowing Base in an amount equal to the sum of the Borrowing Base value, if any, attributable to such Disposed of
Borrowing Base Properties plus the Borrowing Base value, if any, attributable to such unwound, terminated or off-setting hedge positions in the calculation of the then-effective Borrowing Base and, if the Required Lenders in fact make any
such adjustment, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower in writing of the Borrowing Base value, if any, attributable to such Disposed of Borrowing Base Properties in the calculation of the then-effective Borrowing Base and upon
receipt of such notice, the Borrowing Base shall be simultaneously reduced by such amount.  (f) Borrowers Right to Elect Reduced
Borrowing Base. Within three Business Days of its receipt of a New Borrowing Base Notice, the Borrower may provide written notice to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders that specifies for the period from the effective date of the New
Borrowing Base Notice until the next succeeding Scheduled Redetermination Date, the Borrowing Base will be a lesser amount than the amount set forth in such New Borrowing Base Notice, whereupon such specified lesser amount will become the new
Borrowing Base. The Borrowers notice under this Section 2.14(f) shall be irrevocable, but without prejudice to its rights to initiate Interim Redeterminations. 
(g) Administrative Agent Data. The Administrative Agent hereby agrees to provide, promptly, and in any event within 3 Business Days,
following its receipt of a request by the Borrower, an updated Bank Price Deck. In addition, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders agree, upon request, to meet with the Borrower to discuss their evaluation of the reservoir engineering of the Oil
and Gas Properties included in the Reserve Report and their respective methodologies for valuing such properties and the other factors considered in calculating the Borrowing Base. 
(h) Investment Grade Period. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, during any Investment Grade Period, the
provisions of clauses (a) through (f) of Section 2.14 and Section 4.3(c) will be deemed to be inapplicable and shall be disregarded for all purposes. Upon the end of any Investment Grade Period, the Borrowing Base
will be the most recent Borrowing Base in effect until the next Redetermination Date, subject to further adjustments from time to time pursuant to Section 2.14(e). 
2.15 Defaulting Lenders. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender,
then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:  (a) Commitment Fees shall cease to accrue on
the unfunded portion of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 4.1(a); 
   48 





 (b) The Commitment and Total Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in
determining whether all Lenders, the Majority Lenders or the Required Lenders or Borrowing Base Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment or waiver pursuant to Section 13.1);
provided that (i) any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders pursuant to Section 13.1 (other than Section 13.1(x)) or requiring the consent of each affected Lender pursuant to
Section 13.1(i) or (ix), shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender (which for the avoidance of doubt would include any change to the Maturity Date applicable to such Defaulting Lender, decreasing or forgiving any
principal or interest due to such Defaulting Lender, any decrease of any interest rate applicable to Loans made by such Defaulting Lender (other than the waiving of post-default interest rates) and any increase in such Defaulting Lenders
Commitment) and (ii) any redetermination, whether an increase, decrease or affirmation, of the Borrowing Base shall occur without the participation of a Defaulting Lender; 
(c) If any Swingline Exposure or Letter of Credit Exposure exists at the time a Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then (i) all or any
part of such Swingline Exposure and Letter of Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender will, subject to the limitation in the first proviso below, automatically be reallocated (effective on the day such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender) among the
Non-Defaulting Lenders pro rata in accordance with their respective Commitment Percentages; provided that (A) each Non-Defaulting Lenders Total Exposure may not in any event exceed the Commitment Percentage of the Loan Limit of
such Non-Defaulting Lender as in effect at the time of such reallocation and (B) neither such reallocation nor any payment by a Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant thereto will constitute a waiver or release of any claim the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent, the Letter of Credit Issuers or any other Lender may have against such Defaulting Lender or cause such Defaulting Lender to be a Non-Defaulting Lender, (ii) to the extent that all or any portion (the unreallocated
portion) of the Defaulting Lenders Swingline Exposure or Letter of Credit Exposure cannot, or can only partially, be so reallocated to Non-Defaulting Lenders, whether by reason of the first proviso in Section 2.15(c)(i)
or otherwise, the Borrower shall within two Business Days following notice by the Administrative Agent or the applicable Letter of Credit Issuer (x) first, prepay such Swingline Exposure and (y) second, Cash Collateralize for
the benefit of the applicable Letter of Credit Issuer only the Borrowers obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lenders Letter of Credit Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause
(i) above), in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 3.8 for so long as such Letter of Credit Exposure is outstanding, (iii) if the Borrower Cash Collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lenders
Letter of Credit Exposure pursuant to Section 2.15(c), the Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 4.1(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lenders Letter of Credit
Exposure during the period such Defaulting Lenders Letter of Credit Exposure is Cash Collateralized, (iv) if the Letter of Credit Exposure of the Non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to Section 2.15(c), then the
Letter of Credit Fees payable for the account of the Lenders pursuant to Section 4.1(b) shall be adjusted in accordance with such Non-Defaulting Lenders Commitment Percentages and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any
Swingline or Letter of Credit Fees to the Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 4.1(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lenders Letter of Credit Exposure during the period that such Defaulting Lenders Letter of Credit Exposure
is reallocated, or (v) if any Defaulting Lenders Letter of Credit Exposure is neither Cash Collateralized nor reallocated pursuant to this Section 2.15(c), then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the Letter of
Credit Issuer or any Lender hereunder, all Letter of Credit Fees payable under Section 4.1(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lenders Letter of Credit Exposure shall be payable to the Letter of Credit Issuer until such Letter of
Credit Exposure is Cash Collateralized and/or reallocated;  (d) So long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Swingline Lender shall
not be required to fund any Swingline Loan and no Letter of Credit Issuer will be required to issue any new Letter of Credit or amend any outstanding Letter of Credit to increase the Stated Amount thereof, alter the drawing terms thereunder or
extend the expiry date thereof, unless the Letter of Credit Issuer is reasonably satisfied that any exposure that would result from the exposure to such Defaulting Lender is eliminated or fully covered by the Commitments of the Non-Defaulting
Lenders or by Cash Collateralization or a 
   49 





 
combination thereof in accordance with clause (c) above or otherwise in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Letter of Credit Issuer, and participating interests in any such newly
issued or increased Letter of Credit or newly made Swingline Loan shall be allocated among Non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 2.15(c)(i) (and Defaulting Lenders shall not participate therein); and 
(e) If the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender and each Letter of Credit Issuer agree in writing in their discretion that
a Lender that is a Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon, as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set
forth therein, such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender and will be a Non-Defaulting Lender and any applicable Cash Collateral shall be promptly returned to the Borrower and any Letter of Credit Exposure of such Lender reallocated pursuant
to Section 2.15(c) shall be reallocated back to such Lender; provided that, except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Non-Defaulting Lender will
constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from such Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender.  (f)
Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of that Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Section 11 or otherwise, and including any
amounts made available to the Administrative Agent by that Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 13.8), shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of
any amounts owing by that Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by that Defaulting Lender to each Letter of Credit Issuer and the Swingline Lender hereunder;
third, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined
by the Administrative Agent; fourth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a non-interest bearing deposit account and released in order to satisfy obligations of that Defaulting Lender to fund Loans
under this Agreement; fifth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders, the Letter of Credit Issuers or the Swingline Lender as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, such Letter of
Credit Issuer or the Swingline Lender against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; sixth, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any
amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and
seventh, to that Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or Unpaid Drawings, such payment shall be applied solely
to pay the relevant Loans of, and Unpaid Drawings owed to, the relevant non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied in the manner set forth in this Section 2.15(f). Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or
payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 3.8 shall be deemed paid to and redirected by that Defaulting Lender, and each Lender
irrevocably consents hereto.  2.16 Increase of Total Commitment. 
(a) Subject to the conditions set forth in Section 2.16(b), the Borrower may, from time to time (including in connection with any
redetermination of the Borrowing Base), increase the Total Commitment then in effect (any such increase an Incremental Increase) by increasing the Commitment of a Lender (an Increasing Lender) or by causing a
Person that at such time is not a Lender to become a Lender (an Additional Lender). 
   50 





 (b) Any increase in the Total Commitment shall be subject to the following additional conditions:
 (i) such increase shall not be less than $25,000,000 (and increments of $1,000,000 above that minimum) unless the Administrative Agent
otherwise consents, and no such increase shall be permitted if after giving effect thereto the Total Commitment would exceed the Maximum Aggregate Amount; 
(ii) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing after giving effect to such increase; 
(iii) no Lenders Commitment may be increased without the consent of such Lender; 
(iv) the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender and the Letter of Credit Issuer must consent to the increase in Commitments of an
Increasing Lender and the addition of any Additional Lender, in each case, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed;  (v)
the maturity date of such increase shall be the same as the Maturity Date; and  (vi) the increase shall be on the exact same terms and
pursuant to the exact same documentation applicable to this Agreement (other than with respect to any arrangement, structuring, upfront or other fees or discounts payable in connection with such Incremental Increase) (provided that the Applicable
Margin of the Facility may be increased to be consistent with that for such Incremental Increases).  (c) Each Increasing Lender or
Additional Lender shall execute and deliver to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender and the Letter of Credit Issuer customary documentation (any such documentation, an Incremental Agreement) implementing
any Incremental Increase. Upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of one or more executed Incremental Agreements increasing the Commitments of Lenders and/or adding Commitments from Additional Lenders as provided in this Section 2.16,
(i) the Total Commitment shall be increased automatically on the effective date set forth in such Incremental Agreements by the aggregate amount indicated in such Incremental Agreements without further action by the Borrower, the Administrative
Agent, the Swingline Lender and the Letter of Credit Issuer or any Lender, (ii) Schedule 1.1(a) and the Register shall each be amended to add such Additional Lenders Commitment or to reflect the increase in the Commitment of an
Increasing Lender, and the Commitment Percentages of the Lenders shall be adjusted accordingly to reflect the Incremental Increase of each Additional Lender and/or each Increasing Lender, (iii) the Administrative Agent shall distribute to the
Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender, the Letter of Credit Issuer and each Lender the revised Schedule 1.1(a), (iv) any such Additional Lender shall be deemed to be a party in all respects to this Agreement and any
other Credit Documents to which the Lenders are a party, and (v) upon the effective date set forth in such Incremental Agreement, any such Lender party to the Incremental Agreement shall purchase a pro rata portion of the outstanding Loans
(including participations in L/C Obligations or Swingline Loans) of each of the current Lenders such that each Lender (including any Additional Lender, if applicable) shall hold its respective Commitment Percentage of the outstanding Loans (and
participation interests in participations in L/C Obligations or Swingline Loans) as reflected in the revised Schedule 1.1(a) required by this Section 2.16. 
   51 





 SECTION 3. Letters of Credit 
3.1 Letters of Credit. 
(a) Subject to and upon the terms and conditions herein set forth, at any time and from time to time on and after the Closing Date and prior
to the L/C Maturity Date, the Letter of Credit Issuer agrees, in reliance upon the agreements of the Lenders set forth in this Section 3, to issue upon the request of the Borrower and for the direct or indirect benefit of the Borrower
and the Restricted Subsidiaries, a letter of credit or letters of credit (the Letters of Credit and each, a Letter of Credit) in such form and with such Issuer Documents as may be approved by the Letter of
Credit Issuer in its reasonable discretion; provided that the Borrower shall be a co-applicant of, and jointly and severally liable with respect to, each Letter of Credit issued for the account of a Restricted Subsidiary. 
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) no Letter of Credit shall be issued the Stated Amount of which, when added to the Letters of
Credit Outstanding at such time, would exceed the Letter of Credit Commitment then in effect, (ii) no Letter of Credit shall be issued the Stated Amount of which would cause the aggregate amount of all Lenders Total Exposures at such time
to exceed the Loan Limit then in effect, (iii) each Letter of Credit shall have an expiration date occurring no later than one year after the date of issuance or such longer period of time as may be agreed by the applicable Issuing Lender,
unless otherwise agreed upon by the Administrative Agent and the Letter of Credit Issuer or as provided under Section 3.2(b); provided that any Letter of Credit may provide for automatic renewal thereof for additional periods of
up to 12 months or such longer period of time as may be agreed by the applicable Letter of Credit Issuer, subject to the provisions of Section 3.2(b); provided, further, that in no event shall such expiration date occur
later than the L/C Maturity Date unless arrangements which are reasonably satisfactory to the Letter of Credit Issuer to Cash Collateralize (or backstop) such Letter of Credit have been made (provided, however, that no Lenders shall be
obligated to fund participations in respect of any Letter of Credit after the Maturity Date), (iv) each Letter of Credit shall be denominated in Dollars, (v) no Letter of Credit shall be issued if it would be illegal under any applicable
Requirement of Law for the beneficiary of the Letter of Credit to have a Letter of Credit issued in its favor and (vi) no Letter of Credit shall be issued by a Letter of Credit Issuer after it has received a written notice from any Credit Party
or the Administrative Agent or the Majority Lenders stating that a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing until such time as the Letter of Credit Issuer shall have received a written notice (A) of rescission of such notice
from the party or parties originally delivering such notice, (B) of the waiver of such Default or Event of Default in accordance with the provisions of Section 13.1 or (C) that such Default or Event of Default is no longer
continuing.  (c) Upon at least one Business Days prior written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) to the
Administrative Agent and the Letter of Credit Issuer (which notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the applicable Lenders), the Borrower shall have the right, on any day, permanently to terminate or reduce the Letter of
Credit Commitment in whole or in part; provided that, after giving effect to such termination or reduction, the Letters of Credit Outstanding shall not exceed the Letter of Credit Commitment. 
3.2 Letter of Credit Requests. 
(a) Whenever the Borrower desires that a Letter of Credit be issued for its account, the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent and the
Letter of Credit Issuer a Letter of Credit Request by no later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) at least two (or such lesser number as may be agreed upon by the Administrative Agent and the Letter of Credit Issuer) Business Days prior to the
proposed date of issuance. Each notice shall be executed by the Borrower and shall be in the form of Exhibit B or such other form (including by electronic or fax transmission) as reasonably agreed between the Borrower, the

   52 





 
Administrative Agent and the Letter of Credit Issuer (each a Letter of Credit Request). No Letter of Credit Issuer shall issue any Letters of Credit unless such Letter of
Credit Issuer shall have received notice from the Administrative Agent that the conditions to such issuance have been met, which notice shall be deemed given (i) if the Letter of Credit Issuer has not received notice from the Administrative
Agent that the conditions to such issuance have been met within two Business Days after the date of the applicable Letter of Credit Request or (ii) if the aggregate amount of Letters of Credit Outstanding issued by such Letter of Credit Issuer
then outstanding does not exceed the amount theretofore agreed to by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and such Letter of Credit Issuer, and the Administrative Agent has not otherwise notified such Letter of Credit Issuer that it may no longer
rely on this clause (i).  (b) If the Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Request, the Letter of Credit
Issuer may, in its sole and absolute discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic extension provisions (each, an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit); provided that any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit
must permit the Letter of Credit Issuer to prevent any such extension at least once in each 12-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the
Non-Extension Notice Date) in each such 12-month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued. Unless otherwise directed by the Letter of Credit Issuer, the Borrower shall not be required to make a specific
request to the Letter of Credit Issuer for any such extension. Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the Letter of Credit Issuer to permit the extension of such
Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the L/C Maturity Date; provided, however, that the Letter of Credit Issuer shall not permit any such extension if (i) the Letter of Credit Issuer has determined that it
would not be permitted, or would have no obligation, at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its revised form (as extended) under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of clause (b) of Section 3.1 or
otherwise), or (ii) it has received notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is five Business Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date (A) from the Administrative Agent that the Majority Lenders have
elected not to permit such extension or (B) from the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 7 are not then satisfied, and in each such case directing the
Letter of Credit Issuer not to permit such extension.  (c) Each Letter of Credit Issuer (other than the Administrative Agent or any of its
Affiliates) shall, at least once each week, provide the Administrative Agent with a list of all Letters of Credit issued by it that are outstanding at such time; provided that, upon written request from the Administrative Agent, such Letter
of Credit Issuer shall thereafter notify the Administrative Agent in writing on each Business Day of all Letters of Credit issued on the prior Business Day by such Letter of Credit Issuer. 
(d) The making of each Letter of Credit Request shall be deemed to be a representation and warranty by the Borrower that the Letter of Credit
may be issued in accordance with, and will not violate the requirements of, Section 3.1(b).  3.3 Letter of Credit
Participations.  (a) Immediately upon the issuance by the Letter of Credit Issuer of any Letter of Credit, the Letter of Credit Issuer
shall be deemed to have sold and transferred to each Lender (each such Lender, in its capacity under this Section 3.3, an L/C Participant), and each such L/C Participant shall be deemed irrevocably and unconditionally
to have purchased and received from the Letter of Credit Issuer, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation (each an L/C Participation), to the extent of such L/C Participants Commitment
Percentage, in each Letter of Credit, each substitute therefor, each drawing made thereunder and the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement with respect thereto, and any security therefor or guaranty pertaining thereto. 
   53 





 (b) In determining whether to pay under any Letter of Credit, the relevant Letter of Credit
Issuer shall have no obligation relative to the L/C Participants other than to confirm that (i) any documents required to be delivered under such Letter of Credit have been delivered, (ii) the Letter of Credit Issuer has examined the
documents with reasonable care and (iii) the documents appear to comply on their face with the requirements of such Letter of Credit. Any action taken or omitted to be taken by the relevant Letter of Credit Issuer under or in connection with
any Letter of Credit issued by it, if taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct, shall not create for the Letter of Credit Issuer any resulting liability. 
(c) In the event that the Letter of Credit Issuer makes any payment under any Letter of Credit issued by it and the Borrower shall not have
repaid such amount in full to the respective Letter of Credit Issuer pursuant to Section 3.4(a), or if any reimbursement payment is required to be refunded to the Borrower, the Letter of Credit Issuer shall promptly notify the
Administrative Agent and each L/C Participant of such failure, and each such L/C Participant shall promptly and unconditionally pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Letter of Credit Issuer, the amount of such L/C Participants
Commitment Percentage of such unreimbursed payment in Dollars and in immediately available funds; provided, however, that no L/C Participant shall be obligated to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Letter of Credit
Issuer its Commitment Percentage of such unreimbursed amount arising from any wrongful payment made by the Letter of Credit Issuer under any such Letter of Credit as a result of acts or omissions constituting willful misconduct or gross negligence
on the part of the Letter of Credit Issuer (as determined in a final and non appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction). Each L/C Participant shall make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Letter of Credit
Issuer such L/C Participants Commitment Percentage of the amount of such payment no later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the first Business Day after the date notified by the Letter of Credit Issuer in immediately available funds. If
and to the extent such L/C Participant shall not have so made its Commitment Percentage of the amount of such payment available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Letter of Credit Issuer, such L/C Participant agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Letter of Credit Issuer, forthwith on demand, such amount, together with interest thereon for each day from such date until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent for the account of the
Letter of Credit Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the Overnight Rate from time to time then in effect, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Letter of Credit Issuer in connection with the foregoing. The
failure of any L/C Participant to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Letter of Credit Issuer its Commitment Percentage of any payment under any Letter of Credit shall not relieve any other L/C Participant of its
obligation hereunder to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Letter of Credit Issuer its Commitment Percentage of any payment under such Letter of Credit on the date required, as specified above, but no L/C Participant
shall be responsible for the failure of any other L/C Participant to make available to the Administrative Agent such other L/C Participants Commitment Percentage of any such payment. 
(d) Whenever the Letter of Credit Issuer receives a payment in respect of an unpaid reimbursement obligation as to which the Administrative
Agent has received for the account of the Letter of Credit Issuer any payments from the L/C Participants pursuant to clause (c) above, the Letter of Credit Issuer shall pay to the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent shall
promptly pay to each L/C Participant that has paid its Commitment Percentage of such reimbursement obligation, in Dollars and in immediately available funds, an amount equal to such L/C Participants share (based upon the proportionate
aggregate amount originally funded by such L/C Participant to the aggregate amount funded by all L/C Participants) of the principal amount so paid in respect of such reimbursement obligation and interest thereon accruing after the purchase of the
respective L/C Participations at the Overnight Rate. 
   54 





 (e) The obligations of the L/C Participants to make payments to the Administrative Agent for the
account of a Letter of Credit Issuer with respect to Letters of Credit shall be irrevocable and not subject to counterclaim, set-off or other defense or any other qualification or exception whatsoever and shall be made in accordance with the terms
and conditions of this Agreement under all circumstances, including under any of the following circumstances:  (i) any lack of validity or
enforceability of this Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents;  (ii) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other right
that the Borrower may have at any time against a beneficiary named in a Letter of Credit, any transferee of any Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such transferee may be acting), the Administrative Agent, the Letter of Credit Issuer, any
Lender or other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, the transactions contemplated herein or any unrelated transactions (including any underlying transaction between the Borrower and the beneficiary named in any
such Letter of Credit);  (iii) any draft, certificate or any other document presented under any Letter of Credit proving to be forged,
fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect;  (iv) the surrender
or impairment of any security for the performance or observance of any of the terms of any of the Credit Documents; or  (v) the occurrence
of any Default or Event of Default;  provided, however, that no L/C Participant shall be obligated to pay to the Administrative Agent for
the account of the Letter of Credit Issuer its Commitment Percentage of any unreimbursed amount arising from any wrongful payment made by the Letter of Credit Issuer under a Letter of Credit as a result of acts or omissions constituting willful
misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence on the part of the Letter of Credit Issuer (as determined in a final and non appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction). 
3.4 Agreement to Repay Letter of Credit Drawings. 
(a) The Borrower hereby agrees to reimburse the Letter of Credit Issuer by making payment in Dollars to the Administrative Agent for the
account of the Letter of Credit Issuer in immediately available funds, for any payment or disbursement made by the Letter of Credit Issuer under any Letter of Credit issued by it (each such amount so paid until reimbursed, an Unpaid
Drawing) (i) within one Business Day of the date of such payment or disbursement if the Letter of Credit Issuer provides notice to the Borrower of such payment or disbursement prior to 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on such next
succeeding Business Day (from the date of such payment or disbursement or (ii) if such notice is received after such time, on the next Business Day following the date of receipt of such notice (such required date for reimbursement under clause
(i) or (ii), as applicable, on such Business Day (the Reimbursement Date)), with interest on the amount so paid or disbursed by such Letter of Credit Issuer, from and including the date of such payment or disbursement to but
excluding the Reimbursement Date, at the per annum rate for each day equal to the rate described in Section 2.8(a); provided that, notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect to any Letter of
Credit, (i) unless the Borrower shall have notified the Administrative Agent and the Letter of Credit Issuer prior to 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Reimbursement Date that the Borrower intends to reimburse the Letter of Credit Issuer
for the amount of such drawing with funds other than the proceeds of Loans, the Borrower shall be deemed to have given a Notice of Borrowing requesting that the Lenders make Loans (which shall be ABR Loans) on the Reimbursement Date in an amount
equal to the amount at such drawing, and 
   55 





 
(ii) the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Letter of Credit Participant of such drawing and the amount of its Loan to be made in respect thereof, and each Letter of Credit
Participant shall be irrevocably obligated to make a Loan to the Borrower in the manner deemed to have been requested in the amount of its Commitment Percentage of the applicable Unpaid Drawing by 12:00 noon (New York City time) on such
Reimbursement Date by making the amount of such Loan available to the Administrative Agent. Such Loans made in respect of such Unpaid Drawing on such Reimbursement Date shall be made without regard to the limits of Section 2.2 and
without regard to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 7. The Administrative Agent shall use the proceeds of such Loans solely for purpose of reimbursing the Letter of Credit Issuer for the related Unpaid Drawing. In
the event that the Borrower fails to Cash Collateralize any Letter of Credit that is outstanding on the Maturity Date, the full amount of the Letters of Credit Outstanding in respect of such Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be an Unpaid Drawing
subject to the provisions of this Section 3.4 except that the Letter of Credit Issuer shall hold the proceeds received from the Lenders as contemplated above as cash collateral for such Letter of Credit to reimburse any Drawing under
such Letter of Credit and shall use such proceeds first, to reimburse itself for any Drawings made in respect of such Letter of Credit following the L/C Maturity Date, second, to the extent such Letter of Credit expires or is returned
undrawn while any such cash collateral remains, to the repayment of obligations in respect of any Loans that have not paid at such time and third, to the Borrower or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this
Section 3.4(a) shall affect the Borrowers obligation to repay all outstanding Loans when due in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 
(b) The obligations of the Borrower under this Section 3.4 to reimburse the Letter of Credit Issuer with respect to Unpaid
Drawings (including, in each case, interest thereon) shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any set-off, counterclaim or defense to payment that the Borrower or any other Person may have or have had
against the Letter of Credit Issuer, the Administrative Agent or any Lender (including in its capacity as an L/C Participant), including any defense based upon the failure of any drawing under a Letter of Credit (each a Drawing)
to conform to the terms of the Letter of Credit or any non-application or misapplication by the beneficiary of the proceeds of such Drawing; provided that the Borrower shall not be obligated to reimburse the Letter of Credit Issuer for any
wrongful payment made by the Letter of Credit Issuer under the Letter of Credit issued by it as a result of acts or omissions constituting willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence on the part of the Letter of Credit Issuer (as determined in
a final and non appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction).  3.5 Increased Costs. If, after the Closing Date, the
adoption of any Change in Law shall either (a) impose, modify or make applicable any reserve, deposit, capital adequacy, liquidity or similar requirement against letters of credit issued by the Letter of Credit Issuer, or any L/C
Participants L/C Participation therein, or (b) impose on the Letter of Credit Issuer or any L/C Participant any other conditions, costs or expenses affecting its obligations under this Agreement in respect of Letters of Credit or L/C
Participations therein or any Letter of Credit or such L/C Participants L/C Participation therein, and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to the Letter of Credit Issuer or such L/C Participant of issuing, maintaining or
participating in any Letter of Credit, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by the Letter of Credit Issuer or such L/C Participant hereunder (other than (i) Taxes indemnifiable under Section 5.4, or
(ii) Excluded Taxes) in respect of Letters of Credit or L/C Participations therein, then, promptly (and in any event no later than 15 days) after receipt of written demand to the Borrower by the Letter of Credit Issuer or such L/C Participant,
as the case may be (a copy of which notice shall be sent by the Letter of Credit Issuer or such L/C Participant to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to the Letter of Credit Issuer or such L/C Participant such additional amount or
amounts as will compensate the Letter of Credit Issuer or such L/C Participant for such increased cost or reduction, it being understood and agreed, however, that the Letter of Credit Issuer or an L/C Participant shall not be entitled to such
compensation as a result of such Persons compliance with, or 
   56 





 
pursuant to any request or directive to comply with, any such Requirement of Law as in effect on the Closing Date (except as otherwise set forth in the definition of Change in Law). A certificate
submitted to the Borrower by the relevant Letter of Credit Issuer or an L/C Participant, as the case may be (a copy of which certificate shall be sent by the Letter of Credit Issuer or such L/C Participant to the Administrative Agent), setting forth
in reasonable detail the basis for the determination of such additional amount or amounts necessary to compensate the Letter of Credit Issuer or such L/C Participant as aforesaid shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower absent clearly
demonstrable error.  3.6 New or Successor Letter of Credit Issuer. 
(a) The Letter of Credit Issuer may resign as a Letter of Credit Issuer upon 30 days prior written notice to the Administrative Agent,
the Lenders and the Borrower. The Borrower may replace the Letter of Credit Issuer for any reason upon written notice to the Letter of Credit Issuer and the Administrative Agent and may add Letter of Credit Issuers at any time upon notice to the
Administrative Agent. If the Letter of Credit Issuer shall resign or be replaced, or if the Borrower shall decide to add a new Letter of Credit Issuer under this Agreement, then the Borrower may appoint from among the Lenders a successor issuer of
Letters of Credit or a new Letter of Credit Issuer, as the case may be, or, with the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) and such new Letter of Credit Issuer, another successor or new issuer of Letters
of Credit, whereupon such successor issuer shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the replaced or resigning Letter of Credit Issuer under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, or such new issuer of Letters of Credit shall be
granted the rights, powers and duties of a Letter of Credit Issuer hereunder, and the term Letter of Credit Issuer shall mean such successor or such new issuer of Letters of Credit effective upon such appointment. The acceptance of any
appointment as a Letter of Credit Issuer hereunder whether as a successor issuer or new issuer of Letters of Credit in accordance with this Agreement, shall be evidenced by an agreement entered into by such new or successor issuer of Letters of
Credit, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and, from and after the effective date of such agreement, such new or successor issuer of Letters of Credit shall become a Letter of Credit Issuer
hereunder. After the resignation or replacement of a Letter of Credit Issuer hereunder, the resigning or replaced Letter of Credit Issuer shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of a Letter of Credit
Issuer under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such resignation or replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit. In connection with any resignation
or replacement pursuant to this clause (a) (but, in case of any such resignation, only to the extent that a successor issuer of Letters of Credit shall have been appointed), either (i) the Borrower, the resigning or replaced Letter
of Credit Issuer and the successor issuer of Letters of Credit shall arrange to have any outstanding Letters of Credit issued by the resigning or replaced Letter of Credit Issuer replaced with Letters of Credit issued by the successor issuer of
Letters of Credit or (ii) the Borrower shall cause the successor issuer of Letters of Credit, if such successor issuer is reasonably satisfactory to the replaced or resigning Letter of Credit Issuer, to issue back-stop Letters of
Credit naming the resigning or replaced Letter of Credit Issuer as beneficiary for each outstanding Letter of Credit issued by the resigning or replaced Letter of Credit Issuer, which new Letters of Credit shall have a Stated Amount equal to the
Letters of Credit being back-stopped and the sole requirement for drawing on such new Letters of Credit shall be a drawing on the corresponding back-stopped Letters of Credit. After any resigning or replaced Letter of Credit Issuers
resignation or replacement as Letter of Credit Issuer, the provisions of this Agreement relating to a Letter of Credit Issuer shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it (A) while it was a Letter of Credit
Issuer under this Agreement or (B) at any time with respect to Letters of Credit issued by such Letter of Credit Issuer. 
   57 





 (b) To the extent that there are, at the time of any resignation or replacement as set forth in
clause (a) above, any outstanding Letters of Credit, nothing herein shall be deemed to impact or impair any rights and obligations of any of the parties hereto with respect to such outstanding Letters of Credit (including any obligations
related to the payment of fees or the reimbursement or funding of amounts drawn), except that the Borrower, the resigning or replaced Letter of Credit Issuer and the successor issuer of Letters of Credit shall have the obligations regarding
outstanding Letters of Credit described in clause (a) above.  3.7 Role of Letter of Credit Issuer. Each Lender and the
Borrower agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the Letter of Credit Issuer shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of
Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of the Letter of Credit Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective
affiliates nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of the Letter of Credit Issuer shall be liable to any Lender for (a) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Majority Lenders,
(b) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct or (c) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Issuer Document.
The Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit; provided that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Borrowers
pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of the Letter of Credit Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective affiliates nor any correspondent,
participant or assignee of the Letter of Credit Issuer shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in Section 3.3(e); provided that anything in such Section to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower may
have a claim against the Letter of Credit Issuer, and the Letter of Credit Issuer may be liable to the Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to special, indirect, consequential, exemplary or punitive, damages
suffered by the Borrower which the Borrower proves were caused by the Letter of Credit Issuers willful misconduct or gross negligence (as determined in a final and non appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction) or the Letter of
Credit Issuers willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not
in limitation of the foregoing, the Letter of Credit Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and the Letter of
Credit Issuer shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part,
which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason.  3.8 Cash Collateral. 
(a) Upon the request of the Majority Lenders if, as of the L/C Maturity Date, there are any Letters of Credit Outstanding, the Borrower shall
immediately Cash Collateralize the then Letters of Credit Outstanding.  (b) If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the
Majority Lenders may require that the L/C Obligations be Cash Collateralized; provided that, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default referred to in Section 11.5 with respect to the Borrower, the Borrower shall immediately Cash
Collateralize the Letters of Credit then outstanding and no notice or request by or consent from the Majority Lenders shall be required. 
(c) For purposes of this Agreement, Cash Collateralize shall mean to pledge and deposit with or deliver to the
Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Letter of Credit Issuer and the Lenders, as collateral for the L/C Obligations, cash or deposit account balances in an amount equal to the amount 
   58 





 
of the Letters of Credit Outstanding required to be Cash Collateralized pursuant to documentation in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Letter of
Credit Issuer (which documents are hereby consented to by the Lenders). Derivatives of such term have corresponding meanings. The Borrower hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Letter of Credit Issuer and the L/C
Participants, a security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein and all proceeds of the foregoing. Such cash Collateral shall be maintained in blocked, interest bearing deposit accounts established by and in the name of
the Borrower, but under the control (as defined in Section 9-104 of the UCC) of the Administrative Agent.  3.9
Applicability of ISP and UCP. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the Letter of Credit Issuer and the Borrower when a Letter of Credit is issued, (a) the rules of the ISP shall apply to each standby Letter of Credit and (b) the
rules of the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits, as most recently published by the International Chamber of Commerce at the time of issuance, shall apply to each commercial Letter of Credit. 
3.10 Conflict with Issuer Documents. In the event of any conflict between the terms hereof and the terms of any Issuer Document, the
terms hereof shall control.  3.11 Letters of Credit Issued for Restricted Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding that a Letter of Credit
issued or outstanding hereunder is in support of any obligations of, or is for the account of, a Restricted Subsidiary, the Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse the Letter of Credit Issuer hereunder for any and all drawings under such Letter of
Credit. The Borrower hereby acknowledges that the issuance of Letters of Credit for the account of Restricted Subsidiaries inures to the benefit of the Borrower, and that the Borrowers business derives substantial benefits from the businesses
of such Restricted Subsidiaries.  SECTION 4. Fees; Commitments 
4.1 Fees.  (a) The
Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent in Dollars, for the account of each Lender (in each case pro rata according to the respective Commitment Percentages of the Lenders), a commitment fee (the Commitment Fee) for
each day from the Closing Date until but excluding the Termination Date. Each Commitment Fee shall be payable by the Borrower (i) quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December (for the three-month
period (or portion thereof) ended on such day for which no payment has been received) and (ii) on the Termination Date (for the period ended on such date for which no payment has been received pursuant to clause (i) above), and
shall be computed for each day during such period at a rate per annum equal to the Commitment Fee Rate in effect on such day on the Available Commitment (assuming for this purpose that there is no reference to Swingline Exposure in the
definition of Total Exposure) in effect on such day.  (b) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent in Dollars for the
account of the Lenders pro rata on the basis of their respective Letter of Credit Exposure, a fee in respect of each Letter of Credit (the Letter of Credit Fee), for the period from the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit
until the termination or expiration date of such Letter of Credit computed at the per annum rate for each day equal to the Applicable Margin for LIBOR Loans on the average daily Stated Amount of such Letter of Credit. Such Letter of Credit Fees
shall be due and payable (i) quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December and (ii) on the Termination Date (for the period for which no payment has been received pursuant to clause
(i) above). 
   59 





 (c) The Borrower agrees to pay to each Letter of Credit Issuer a fee in respect of each Letter of
Credit issued by it (the Fronting Fee), for the period from the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit to the termination or expiration date of such Letter of Credit, computed at the rate for each day equal to 0.125% per
annum (or such other amount a may be agreed in a separate writing between the Borrower and any Letter of Credit Issuer) on the average daily Stated Amount of such Letter of Credit (or at such other rate per annum as agreed in writing between the
Borrower and the Letter of Credit Issuer). Such Fronting Fees shall be due and payable by the Borrower (i) quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December and (ii) on the Termination Date (for the
period for which no payment has been received pursuant to clause (i) above).  (d) The Borrower agrees to pay directly to the
Letter of Credit Issuer upon each issuance of, drawing under, and/or amendment of, a Letter of Credit issued by it such amount as the Letter of Credit Issuer and the Borrower shall have agreed upon for issuances of, drawings under or amendments of,
letters of credit issued by it.  (e) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent the administrative agent fees in the amounts
and on the dates as set forth in writing from time to time between the Administrative Agent and the Borrower.  4.2 Voluntary Reduction
of Commitments.  (a) Upon at least two Business Days prior written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing)
to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agents Office (which notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the Lenders), the Borrower shall have the right, without premium or penalty, on any day, to permanently
terminate or reduce the Commitments, as determined by the Borrower, in whole or in part; provided that (i) any such termination or reduction shall apply ratably to reduce each Lenders Commitment, (b) any partial reduction
pursuant to this Section 4.2 shall be in the amount of at least $500,000 and in an integral multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof and (c) after giving effect to such termination or reduction and to any prepayments of Loans or
cancellation or Cash Collateralization of Letters of Credit made on the date thereof in accordance with this Agreement, the aggregate amount of all Lenders Total Exposures shall not exceed the Loan Limit. 
(b) The Borrower may terminate the unused amount of the Commitment of a Defaulting Lender upon not less than two (2) Business Days
prior notice to the Administrative Agent (which will promptly notify the Lenders thereof), and in such event the provisions of Section 2.15(f) will apply to all amounts thereafter paid by the Borrower for the account of such Defaulting
Lender under this Agreement (whether on account of principal, interest, fees, indemnity or other amounts), provided that such termination will not be deemed to be a waiver or release of any claim the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, any
Letter of Credit Issuer, the Swingline Lender or any Lender may have against such Defaulting Lender.  4.3 Mandatory Termination or
Reduction of Commitments.  (a) The Total Commitment shall terminate at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the Termination Date. 
(b) The Swingline Commitment shall terminate at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the earlier of (x) the Swingline Maturity Date and
(y) the Termination Date. 
   60 





 (c) If any reduction in the Borrowing Base would result in the Borrowing Base being less than the
Total Commitments, the Total Commitments shall be automatically and permanently (but subject to Section 2.16) reduced, without premium or penalty, contemporaneously with such reduction in the Borrowing Base so that the Total Commitment
equals the Borrowing Base as reduced; provided that any such reduction shall apply ratably to reduce each Lenders Commitment. Concurrently with, and effective on, the Redetermination Date applicable to such Borrowing Base reduction,
(i) Schedule 1.1(a) and the Register shall each be amended to reflect the decrease in the Total Commitment and the Commitment of each Lender and (ii) the Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute to the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender, the Letter of Credit Issuer and each Lender the revised Schedule 1.1(a).  SECTION
5. Payments  5.1 Voluntary Prepayments. The Borrower shall have the right to prepay Loans and Swingline Loans, in each case,
without premium or penalty, in whole or in part from time to time on the following terms and conditions:  (a) the Borrower shall give the
Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agents Office written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) of its intent to make such prepayment, the amount of such prepayment and (in the case of LIBOR Loans) the specific
Borrowing(s) being prepaid, which notice shall be given by the Borrower no later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) (i) in the case of LIBOR Loans, three Business Days prior to and (ii) in the case of ABR Loans on the date of such
prepayment and shall promptly be transmitted by the Administrative Agent to each of the Lenders;  (b) each partial prepayment of
(i) LIBOR Loans shall be in a minimum amount of $500,000 and in multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof, and (ii) any ABR Loans shall be in a minimum amount of $500,000 and in multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof; provided that
no partial prepayment of LIBOR Loans made pursuant to a single Borrowing shall reduce the outstanding LIBOR Loans made pursuant to such Borrowing to an amount less than $1,000,000 for such LIBOR Loans; and 
(c) any prepayment of LIBOR Loans pursuant to this Section 5.1 on any day other than the last day of an Interest Period applicable
thereto shall be subject to compliance by the Borrower with the applicable provisions of Section 2.11.  Each such notice shall specify the
date and amount of such prepayment and the Type of Loans to be prepaid. At the Borrowers election in connection with any prepayment pursuant to this Section 5.1, such prepayment shall not be applied to any Loans of a Defaulting
Lender.  5.2 Mandatory Prepayments. 
(a) Repayment following Optional Reduction of Commitments. If, after giving effect to any termination or reduction of the Commitments
pursuant to Section 4.2(a), the aggregate Total Exposures of all Lenders exceeds the Loan Limit (as reduced), then the Borrower shall on the same Business Day (i) prepay the Swingline Loans and, after all Swingline Loans have been
paid in full, the remaining Loans on the date of such termination or reduction in an aggregate principal amount equal to such excess and (ii) if any excess remains after prepaying all of the Loans as a result of any Letter of Credit Exposure,
pay to the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Letter of Credit Issuer and the L/C Participants an amount in cash equal to such excess to be held as cash collateral as provided in Section 3.8. 
   61 





 (b) Repayment of Loans Following Redetermination or Adjustment of Borrowing Base. 
(i) Upon any redetermination of the Borrowing Base in accordance with Section 2.14(b), if the aggregate Total Exposures of all
Lenders exceeds the redetermined Borrowing Base, then the Borrower shall, within 10 Business Days after its receipt of a New Borrowing Base Notice indicating such Borrowing Base Deficiency, inform the Administrative Agent of the Borrowers
election to: (A) within 30 days following such election prepay the Loans in an aggregate principal amount equal to such excess, (B) prepay the Loans in six equal monthly installments, commencing on the 30th day following its receipt of
such New Borrowing Base Notice with each payment being equal to 1/6th of the aggregate principal amount of such excess, (C) within 30 days following such election, provide additional Collateral in the form of additional Oil and Gas Properties
not evaluated in the most recently delivered Reserve Report or other Collateral reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent having a Borrowing Base value (as proposed by the Administrative Agent and approved by the Required Lenders)
sufficient, after giving effect to any other actions taken pursuant to this Section 5.2(b)(i) to eliminate any such excess or (D) undertake a combination of clauses (A), (B) and (C); provided that
if, because of Letter of Credit Exposure, a Borrowing Base Deficiency remains after prepaying all of the Loans, the Borrower shall Cash Collateralize such remaining Borrowing Base Deficiency as provided in Section 3.8; provided
further, that all payments required to be made pursuant to this Section 5.2(b)(i) must be made on or prior to the Termination Date. 
(ii) Upon any adjustment to the Borrowing Base pursuant to Section 2.14(e), if the aggregate Total Exposures of all Lenders
exceeds the Borrowing Base, as adjusted, then the Borrower shall (A) prepay the Loans in an aggregate principal amount equal to such excess and (B) if any excess remains after prepaying all of the Loans as a result of any Letter of Credit
Exposure, Cash Collateralize such excess as provided in Section 3.8. The Borrower shall be obligated to make such prepayment and/or deposit of cash collateral no later than two Business Days following the date it receives written notice
from the Administrative Agent of the adjustment of the Borrowing Base and the resulting Borrowing Base Deficiency; provided that all payments required to be made pursuant to this clause must be made on or prior to the Termination Date. 
(iii) If the Borrower issues any Indebtedness permitted under Section 10.1(m) or (n) at any time a Borrowing Base
Deficiency exists, the Borrower shall prepay the Loans on the date the Borrower receives the net proceeds from the issuance of such Senior Notes in an amount sufficient to eliminate such Borrowing Base Deficiency. For the avoidance of doubt,
Borrower shall be required to continue to comply with Section 5.2(b)(ii) with respect to any Borrowing Base Deficiency existing at the time of such issuance of Senior Notes for any reason other than any Disposition of Borrowing Base
Properties.  (c) Application to Loans. With respect to each prepayment of Loans elected under Section 5.1 or required
by Section 5.2, the Borrower may designate (i) the Types of Loans that are to be prepaid and the specific Borrowing(s) being repaid and (ii) the Loans to be prepaid; provided that (A) each prepayment of any Loans
made pursuant to a Borrowing shall be applied pro rata among such Loans and (B) notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding clause (A), no prepayment of Loans shall be applied to the Loans of any Defaulting Lender unless otherwise
agreed in writing by the Borrower. In the absence of a designation by the Borrower as described in the preceding sentence, the Administrative Agent shall, subject to the above, make such designation in its reasonable discretion with a view, but no
obligation, to minimize breakage costs owing under Section 2.11.  (d) LIBOR Interest Periods. In lieu of making any
payment pursuant to this Section 5.2 in respect of any LIBOR Loan, other than on the last day of the Interest Period therefor so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Borrower at its option may deposit,
on behalf of the Borrower, with the Administrative Agent an amount equal to the amount of the LIBOR Loan to be prepaid and such LIBOR Loan shall be repaid on the last day of the Interest Period therefor in the required amount. Such deposit shall be
held by the Administrative Agent in a corporate time deposit account established on terms reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, earning interest at the then customary rate for accounts of such type. Such deposit shall constitute cash
collateral for the LIBOR Loans to be so prepaid; provided that the Borrower may at any time direct that such deposit be applied to make the applicable payment required pursuant to this Section 5.2. 
   62 





 5.3 Method and Place of Payment. 
(a) Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all payments under this Agreement shall be made by the Borrower without set-off,
counterclaim or deduction of any kind, to the Administrative Agent for the ratable account of the Lenders entitled thereto or the Letter of Credit Issuer or the Swingline Lender entitled thereto, as the case may be, not later than 2:00 p.m.
(New York City time), in each case, on the date when due and shall be made in immediately available funds at the Administrative Agents Office or at such other office as the Administrative Agent shall specify for such purpose by notice to the
Borrower; it being understood that written or facsimile notice by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent to make a payment from the funds in the Borrowers account at the Administrative Agents Office shall constitute the making of such
payment to the extent of such funds held in such account. All repayments or prepayments of any Loans (whether of principal, interest or otherwise) hereunder and all other payments under each Credit Document shall be made in Dollars. The
Administrative Agent will thereafter cause to be distributed on the same day (if payment was actually received by the Administrative Agent prior to 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) or, otherwise, on the next Business Day in the sole discretion of
the Administrative Agent) like funds relating to the payment of principal or interest or fees ratably to the Lenders or the Letter of Credit Issuer, as applicable, entitled thereto. 
(b) For purposes of computing interest or fees, any payments under this Agreement that are made later than 2:00 p.m. (New York City time)
shall be deemed to have been made on the next succeeding Business Day in the sole discretion of the Administrative Agent. Whenever any payment to be made hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the due date thereof
shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, with respect to payments of principal, interest shall be payable during such extension at the applicable rate in effect immediately prior to such extension. 
5.4 Net Payments.  (a)
Any and all payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower or any Guarantor under this Agreement or any other Credit Document shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes; provided that if the Borrower or any Guarantor or the Administrative Agent shall be required by applicable Requirements of Law to deduct or withhold any Taxes from such payments, then (i) the Borrower or such Guarantor or the
Administrative Agent shall make such deductions or withholdings as are reasonably determined by the Borrower, such Guarantor or the Administrative Agent to be required by any applicable Requirement of Law, (ii) the Borrower, such Guarantor or
the Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority within the time allowed and in accordance with applicable Requirements of Law, and (iii) to the extent
withholding or deduction is required to be made on account of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, the sum payable by the Borrower or such Guarantor shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions and withholdings
(including deductions or withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 5.4) the Administrative Agent, any Letter of Credit Issuer or any Lender, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have
received had no such deductions or withholdings been made. Whenever any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes are payable by the Borrower or such Guarantor, as promptly as possible thereafter, the Borrower or Guarantor shall send to the Administrative
Agent for its own account or for the account of such Letter of Credit Issuer or Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy of an official receipt (or other evidence acceptable to such Letter of Credit Issuer or Lender, acting

   63 





 
reasonably) received by the Borrower or such Guarantor showing payment thereof. After any payment of Taxes by any Credit Party or the Administrative Agent to a Governmental Authority as provided
in this Section 5.4, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent or the Administrative Agent shall deliver to the Borrower, as the case may be, a copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment,
a copy of any return required by laws to report such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be. 
(b) The Borrower shall timely pay and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent and each Lender with regard to any Other
Taxes (whether or not such Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority).  (c) The
Borrower shall indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent and each Lender within 15 Business Days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed on the Administrative Agent or such
Lender, as the case may be (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 5.4), and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or
not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the basis and calculation of the amount of such payment or liability
delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or the Administrative Agent (as applicable) on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
(d) Each Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law and such other reasonably requested information as will permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, to determine
(A) whether or not any payments made hereunder or under any other Credit Document are subject to Taxes, (B) if applicable, the required rate of withholding or deduction, and (C) such Lenders entitlement to any available
exemption from, or reduction of, applicable Taxes in respect of any payments to be made to such Lender by any Credit Party pursuant to any Credit Document or otherwise to establish such Lenders status for withholding tax purposes in the
applicable jurisdiction. In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as
will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. 
(e) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Non-U.S. Lender with respect to any Loan made to the Borrower shall, to the extent
it is legally entitled to do so:  (i) deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, prior to the date on which the first payment to
the Non-U.S. Lender is due hereunder, two copies of (A) in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of portfolio
interest, United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or any applicable successor form) (together with a certificate representing that such Non-U.S. Lender is not a bank for purposes of Section 881(c) of the Code, is not a 10%
shareholder (within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code) of the Borrower, is not a CFC related to the Borrower (within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the Code) and the interest payments in question are not effectively
connected with the United States trade or business conducted by such Lender), (B) Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Form W-8ECI (or any applicable successor form), in each case properly completed and duly executed by such Non-U.S. Lender
claiming complete exemption from, or reduced rate of, U.S. Federal withholding tax on payments by the Borrower under this Agreement, (C) Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY (or any applicable successor form) and all necessary attachments

   64 





 
(including the forms described in clauses (A) and (B) above, as required) or (D) any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or
a reduction in United States federal withholding tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and 
(ii) deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two further copies of any such form or certification (or any applicable successor
form) on or before the date that any such form or certification expires or becomes obsolete or invalid, after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form previously delivered by it to the Borrower, and from time to time
thereafter if reasonably requested by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent;  unless in any such case any Change in Law has occurred prior to the date
on which any such delivery would otherwise be required that renders any such form inapplicable or would prevent such Non-U.S. Lender from duly completing and delivering any such form with respect to it and such Non-U.S. Lender promptly so advises
the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. Each Person that shall become a Participant pursuant to Section 13.6 or a Lender pursuant to Section 13.6 shall, upon the effectiveness of the related transfer, be required to
provide all the forms and statements required pursuant to this Section 5.4(e); provided that in the case of a Participant such Participant shall furnish all such required forms and statements to the Lender from which the related
participation shall have been purchased.  (f) If any Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, determines, in its sole
discretion, that it had received and retained a refund of an Indemnified Tax or Other Tax for which a payment has been made by the Borrower or any Guarantor pursuant to this Agreement or any other Credit Document, which refund in the good faith
judgment of such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, is attributable to such payment made by the Borrower or any Guarantor, then such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, shall reimburse the Borrower or such
Guarantor for such amount (net of all out-of-pocket expenses of such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, and without interest other than any interest received thereon from the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such
refund) as such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, determines in its sole discretion to be the proportion of the refund as will leave it, after such reimbursement, in no better or worse position (taking into account expenses or
any taxes imposed on the refund) than it would have been in if the payment had not been required; provided that the Borrower or such Guarantor, upon the request of such Lender or the Administrative Agent, agrees to repay the amount paid over
to the Borrower or such Guarantor (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to such Lender or the Administrative Agent in the event such Lender or the Administrative Agent is required to repay
such refund to such Governmental Authority. In such event, such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, shall, at the Borrowers request, provide the Borrower with a copy of any notice of assessment or other evidence of the
requirement to repay such refund received from the relevant Governmental Authority (provided that such Lender or the Administrative Agent may delete any information therein that it deems confidential). Each Lender and the Administrative Agent shall
claim any refund that it determines is available to it, unless it concludes in its sole discretion that it would be adversely affected by making such a claim. No Lender nor the Administrative Agent shall be obliged to make available its tax returns
(or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to any Credit Party in connection with this clause (f) or any other provision of this Section 5.4. 
(g) If the Borrower determines that a reasonable basis exists for contesting a Tax, each Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may
be, shall use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower as the Borrower may reasonably request in challenging such Tax. The Borrower shall indemnify and hold each Lender and the Administrative Agent harmless against any out-of-pocket

   65 





 
expenses incurred by such Person in connection with any request made by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 5.4(g). Nothing in this Section 5.4(g) shall obligate any
Lender or the Administrative Agent to take any action that such Person, in its sole judgment, determines may result in a material detriment to such Person. 
(h) The Administrative Agent and each Lender that is a United States person under Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (each, a U.S.

Agent or the Majority Lenders (as accompanied by the Administrative Agent) to visit and inspect any of the properties or assets of the Borrower or such Subsidiary in whomsoevers possession to the extent that it is within such partys
control to permit such 
   77 





 
inspection (and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such inspection to be permitted to the extent that it is not within such partys control to permit such inspection), and to
examine the books and records of the Borrower and any such Subsidiary and discuss the affairs, finances and accounts of the Borrower and of any such Subsidiary with, and be advised as to the same by, its and their officers and independent
accountants, upon reasonable advance notice to the Borrower, all at such reasonable times and intervals during normal business hours and to such reasonable extent as the Administrative Agent or the Majority Lenders may desire (and subject, in the
case of any such meetings or advice from such independent accountants, to such accountants customary policies and procedures); provided that, excluding any such visits and inspections during the continuation of an Event of Default
(i) only the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Majority Lenders may exercise rights of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under this Section 9.2, and (ii) only one such visit shall be at the Borrowers expense;
provided, further, that when an Event of Default exists, the Administrative Agent (or any of its representatives or independent contractors) or any representative of the Majority Lenders may do any of the foregoing at the expense of
the Borrower at any time during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice. The Administrative Agent and the Majority Lenders shall give the Borrower the opportunity to participate in any discussions with the Borrowers
independent public accountants. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 9.1(f)(iii) or this Section 9.2, neither the Borrower nor any Restricted Subsidiary will be required to disclose, permit the inspection,
examination or making copies or abstracts of, or discussion of, any document, information or other matter (i) that constitutes non-financial trade secrets or non-financial proprietary information, (ii) in respect of which disclosure to the
Administrative Agent or any Lender (or their respective representatives or contractors) is prohibited by any Requirement of Law or any binding agreement or (iii) that is subject to attorney-client or similar privilege or constitutes attorney
work product.  (b) The Borrower will, and will cause each of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, maintain proper books of record and account,
in which entries that are full, true and correct in all material respects and are in conformity with GAAP consistently applied shall be made of all material financial transactions and matters involving the assets and business of the Borrower or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be.  9.3 Maintenance of Insurance. The Borrower will, and will cause each Restricted
Subsidiary to, at all times maintain in full force and effect, pursuant to self-insurance arrangements or with insurance companies that the Borrower believes (in the good faith judgment of the management of the Borrower) are financially sound and
responsible at the time the relevant coverage is placed or renewed, insurance in at least such amounts (after giving effect to any self-insurance which the Borrower believes (in the good faith judgment of management of the Borrower) is reasonable
and prudent in light of the size and nature of its business) and against at least such risks (and with such risk retentions) as the Borrower believes (in the good faith judgment of management of the Borrower) is reasonable and prudent in light of
the size and nature of its business; and will furnish to the Administrative Agent, upon written request from the Administrative Agent, information presented in reasonable detail as to the insurance so carried. The Secured Parties shall be the
additional insureds on any such liability insurance as their interests may appear and, if casualty insurance is obtained, the Administrative Agent shall be the additional loss payee under any such casualty insurance; provided that, so long as
no Event of Default has occurred and is then continuing, the Secured Parties will provide any proceeds of such casualty insurance to the Borrower to the extent that the Borrower undertakes to apply such proceeds to the reconstruction, replacement or
repair of the property insured thereby. All policies of insurance required by the terms of this Agreement or any Security Document shall provide that each insurer shall endeavor to give at least 30 days prior written notice to the
Administrative Agent of any cancellation of such insurance (or at least 10 days prior written notice in the case of cancellation of such insurance due to non-payment of premiums). 
   78

Subsidiaries to pay and discharge, all taxes, assessments and governmental charges or levies imposed upon it or upon its income or profits, or upon any properties belonging to it, prior to the date on which material penalties attach thereto, and all
lawful material claims in respect of any Taxes imposed, assessed or levied that, if unpaid, would reasonably be expected to become a material Lien upon any properties of the Borrower or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries; provided that
neither the Borrower nor any of the Subsidiaries shall be required to pay or discharge any such tax, assessment, charge, levy or claim that is being contested in good faith and by proper proceedings if it has maintained adequate reserves (in the
good faith judgment of management of the Borrower) with respect thereto to the extent required by, and in accordance with, GAAP or the failure to pay or discharge would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. 
9.5 Consolidated Corporate Franchises. The Borrower will do, and will cause each Restricted Subsidiary to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its existence, corporate rights and authority, except to the extent that the failure to do so would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; provided,
however, that the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries may consummate any transaction permitted under Section 10.3, 10.4 or 10.5. 
9.6 Compliance with Statutes, Regulations, Etc. The Borrower will, and will cause each Restricted Subsidiary to, comply with all
Requirements of Law applicable to it or its property, including all governmental approvals or authorizations required to conduct its business, and to maintain all such governmental approvals or authorizations in full force and effect, in each case

Effect, the Borrower will deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of an Authorized Officer or any other senior officer of the Borrower setting forth details as to such occurrence and the action, if any, that the Borrower or such ERISA
Affiliate is required or proposes to take, together with any notices (required, proposed or otherwise) given to or filed with or by the Borrower, such ERISA Affiliate, the PBGC, a Plan participant (other than notices relating to an individual
participants benefits) or the Plan administrator with respect thereto: that a Reportable Event has occurred; that an accumulated funding deficiency has been incurred or an application is to be made to the Secretary of the Treasury for a waiver
or modification of the minimum funding standard (including any required installment payments) or an extension of any amortization period under Section 412 of the Code with respect to a Plan; that a Plan having an Unfunded Current Liability has
been or is to be terminated, reorganized, partitioned or declared insolvent under Title IV of ERISA (including the giving of written notice thereof); that a Plan has an Unfunded Current Liability that has or will result in a lien under ERISA or
the Code; that proceedings will be or have been instituted to terminate a Plan having an Unfunded Current Liability (including the giving of written notice thereof); that a proceeding has been instituted against the Borrower or an ERISA Affiliate
pursuant to Section 515 of ERISA to collect a delinquent contribution to a Plan; that the PBGC has notified the Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate of its intention to appoint a trustee to administer any Plan; that the Borrower or any ERISA
Affiliate has failed to make a required installment or other payment pursuant to Section 412 of the Code with respect to a Plan; or that the Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate has incurred or will incur (or has been notified in writing that it

and (ii) any notices described in Section 101(l) of ERISA that the Borrower and any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate may request with respect to any Multiemployer Plan; provided that if the Borrower, any of its
Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate has not requested such documents or notices from the administrator or sponsor of the applicable Multiemployer Plan, the Borrower, the applicable Subsidiary(ies) or the ERISA Affiliate(s) shall promptly make a
request for such documents or notices from such administrator or sponsor and shall provide copies of such documents and notices promptly after receipt thereof. 
9.8 Maintenance of Properties. The Borrower will, and will cause each of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, except in each case, where the
failure to so comply would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect:  (a) operate its Oil and Gas Properties and
other material properties or cause such Oil and Gas Properties and other material properties to be operated in a careful and efficient manner in accordance with the practices of the industry and in compliance with all applicable Contractual
Requirements and all applicable Requirements of Law, including applicable proration requirements and Environmental Laws, and all applicable Requirements of Law of every other Governmental Authority from time to time constituted to regulate the

hereby authorized by the Lenders to, make any adjustments to this Agreement that are necessary in order to reflect such change in financial reporting.

(ii) any Subsidiary of the Borrower that ceases to be an Excluded Subsidiary, in each case within 30 days from the date of such formation, acquisition or cessation, as applicable (or such longer period as the Administrative Agent may agree in
its reasonable discretion) to execute a supplement to each of the Guarantee, the Security Agreement and the Pledge Agreement, substantially in the form of Annex A, Exhibit 1 or Annex A, as applicable, to the respective

   80 





 (b) On any date that is not during an Investment Grade Period, subject to any applicable
limitations set forth in the Pledge Agreement, the Borrower will pledge, and, if applicable, will cause each other Subsidiary Guarantor (or Person required to become a Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to Section 9.10(a)) to pledge, to the
Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties all of the Stock (other than any Excluded Stock) of each Subsidiary owned by the Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor (or Person required to become a Guarantor pursuant to
Section 9.10(a)), in each case, formed or otherwise purchased or acquired after the Closing Date, pursuant to a supplement to the Pledge Agreement substantially in the form of Annex A thereto. 
(c) In connection with each redetermination (but not any adjustment) of the Borrowing Base, the Borrower shall review the applicable Reserve
Report, if any, and the list of current Mortgaged Properties (as described in Section 9.13(b)), to ascertain whether the PV-9 of the Collateral (calculated at the time of redetermination) meets the Collateral Coverage Minimum after
giving effect to exploration and production activities, acquisitions, Dispositions and production. In the event that the Collateral Coverage Ratio (calculated at the time of redetermination) does not meet the Collateral Coverage Minimum, then the
Borrower shall, and shall cause its Credit Parties to, grant, within 60 days of delivery of the certificate required under Section 9.13(b) (or such longer period as the Administrative Agent may agree in its reasonable discretion), to the
Administrative Agent as security for the Obligations a first-priority Lien (subject to Liens permitted by Section 10.2) on additional Oil and Gas Properties not already subject to a Lien of the Security Documents such that, after giving
effect thereto, the Collateral Coverage Ratio (calculated at the time of redetermination) meets the Collateral Coverage Minimum. All such Liens will be created and perfected by and in accordance with the provisions of the Security Documents,
including, if applicable, any additional Mortgages. In order to comply with the foregoing, if any Restricted Subsidiary places a Lien on its property and such Subsidiary is not a Guarantor, then it shall become a Guarantor and comply with the

to which the Borrower or its Subsidiaries may acquire Oil and Gas Properties and other assets.  9.12 Further Assurances. 
(a) Subject to the applicable limitations set forth in the Security Documents, the Borrower will, and will cause each other Credit Party to,
execute any and all further documents, financing statements, agreements and instruments, and take all such further actions (including the filing and recording of financing statements, fixture, filings, assignments of as-extracted collateral,

grant, preserve, protect and perfect the validity and priority of the security interests created or intended to be created by the applicable Security Documents, all at the expense of the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries. 
(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the Administrative Agent and the Borrower reasonably determine in writing that the
cost of creating or perfecting any Lien on any property is excessive in relation to the benefits afforded to the Lenders thereby, then such property may be excluded from the Collateral for all purposes of the Credit Documents.

Petroleum Engineers provided so long as such report covers at least 85% of the total value of Proved Reserves set forth in such Reserve Report, with the remaining value covered by a report prepared by or under the supervision of the chief
engineer of the Borrower.  (b) In the event of an Interim Redetermination, the Borrower shall furnish to the Administrative Agent a

obtain any improper advantage, in violation of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977.  9.17 Post-Closing
Covenant. On or prior to the date that is sixty (60) days following the Closing Date (or such later date as agreed to by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent shall be reasonably satisfied that the Collateral Coverage Minimum
is satisfied as of such date of determination.  SECTION 10. Negative Covenants.

owing by a Credit Party to a Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor shall be permitted so long as such Indebtedness is evidenced by an intercompany note and subject to subordination terms acceptable to the Administrative Agent, to the extent permitted
by Requirements of Law and not giving rise to material adverse tax consequences, (ii) any Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor owing to any other Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor and (iii) to the extent permitted by

Credit Party, except as otherwise specifically provided for in this Agreement (provided that, if an Event of Default specified in Section 11.5 shall occur with respect to the Borrower, the result that would occur upon the giving
of written notice by the Administrative Agent as specified in clauses (a), (b) and (d) below shall occur automatically without the giving of any such notice): (a) declare the Total Commitment and Swingline
Commitment terminated, whereupon the Commitment of each Lender and the Swingline Lender, as the case may be, shall forthwith terminate immediately and any fees theretofore accrued shall forthwith become due and payable without any other notice of
any kind; (b) declare the principal of and any accrued interest and fees in respect of any or all Loans and any or all Obligations owing hereunder and thereunder to be, whereupon the same shall become, forthwith due and payable without
presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower; (c) terminate any Letter of Credit that may be terminated in accordance with its terms; and/or (d) direct the Borrower to pay (and

Office such additional amounts of cash, to be held as security for the Borrowers respective reimbursement obligations for Drawings that may subsequently occur thereunder, equal to the aggregate Stated Amount of all Letters of Credit issued and
then outstanding. In addition, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders will have all other rights and remedies available at law and equity. 
Any amount received by the Administrative Agent from any Credit Party (or from proceeds of any Collateral) following any acceleration of the
Obligations under this Agreement or any Event of Default with respect to the Borrower under Section 11.5 shall be applied:  (i)
first, to payment or reimbursement of that portion of the Obligations constituting fees, expenses and indemnities payable to the Administrative Agent in each Persons capacity as such; 
(ii) second, to the Secured Parties, an amount equal to all Obligations due and owing to them on the date of distribution and, if such
moneys shall be insufficient to pay such amounts in full, then ratably (without priority of any one over any other) to such Secured Parties in proportion to the unpaid amount thereof; and 
(iii) third, pro rata to any other Obligations then due and owing; and 
(iv) fourth, any surplus then remaining, after all of the Obligations then due shall have been indefeasibly paid in full in cash, shall
be paid to the Borrower or its successors or assigns or to whomever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same or as a court of competent jurisdiction may award. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, amounts received from the Borrower or any Credit Party that is not an eligible contract participant under the
Commodity Exchange Act shall not be applied to any Excluded Hedge Obligations (it being understood, that in the event that any amount is applied to Obligations other than Excluded Hedge Obligations as a result of this clause, the Administrative
Agent shall make such adjustments as it determines are appropriate to distributions pursuant to clause second above from amounts received from eligible contract participants under the Commodity Exchange Act to ensure, as nearly as
possible, that the proportional aggregate recoveries with respect to Obligations described in clause second above by the holders of any Excluded Hedge Obligations are the same as the proportional aggregate recoveries with respect to other
Obligations pursuant to clause second above). 
   106 





 SECTION 12. The Administrative Agent 
12.1 Appointment.  (a)
Each Lender hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Administrative Agent as the agent of such Lender under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents and irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent, in such capacity, to take such
action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of this Agreement and the other Credit
Documents, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The provisions of this Section 12 (other than Section 12.1(b) with respect to the Joint Lead Arrangers, the Joint Bookrunners, the
Co-Syndication Agents and the Co-Documentation Agents and Section 12.9 with respect to the Borrower) are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and the Borrower shall not have rights as third party
beneficiary of any such provision. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary
relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Credit Document or otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent. 
(b) Each of the Co-Syndication Agents, the Co-Documentation Agents, the Joint Lead Arrangers and the Joint Bookrunners, each in its capacity
as such, shall not have any obligations, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement but shall be entitled to all benefits of this Section 12. 
12.2 Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents
by or through agents, sub-agents, employees or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any
agents, sub-agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined in the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction). 
12.3 Exculpatory Provisions. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact
or Affiliates shall be (a) liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by any of them under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Credit Document (except for its or such Persons own gross negligence or willful
misconduct, as determined in the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, in connection with its duties expressly set forth herein (IT BEING THE INTENTION OF THE PARTIES HERETO THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND ANY RELATED PARTIES SHALL,
IN ALL CASES, BE INDEMNIFIED FOR ITS ORDINARY, COMPARATIVE, CONTRIBUTORY OR SOLE NEGLIGENCE)) or (b) responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders or any participant for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by any of
the Borrower, any other Credit Party or any officer thereof contained in this Agreement or any other Credit Document or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the Administrative Agent
under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Credit Document or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Credit Document, or the perfection or priority of any Lien
or security interest created or purported to be created under the Security Documents, or for any failure of the Borrower or any other Credit Party to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. The Administrative Agent shall not be under any
obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Credit Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of any
Credit Party or any Affiliate thereof. The Administrative Agent shall not be under any obligation to any Lender, the Swingline Lender or any Letter of Credit Issuer to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the
agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Credit Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of any Credit Party. 
   107 





 12.4 Reliance. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully
protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telecopy, telex or teletype message, statement, order or other document or instruction believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been
signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may
deem and treat the Lender specified in the Register with respect to any amount owing hereunder as the owner thereof for all purposes unless a written notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall have been filed with the Administrative
Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Credit Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Majority Lenders as it deems
appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense that may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Administrative Agent shall in all
cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents in accordance with a request of the Majority Lenders, and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto
shall be binding upon all the Lenders and all future holders of the Loans; provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or in the opinion of its counsel, may expose it to liability or
that is contrary to any Credit Document or applicable Requirements of Law. For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions specified in Section 6 and Section 7 on the Closing Date, each Lender that has signed this
Agreement shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with, each document or other matter required thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to a Lender unless the Administrative
Agent shall have received notice from such Lender prior to the proposed Closing Date specifying its objection thereto.  12.5 Notice of
Default. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default hereunder unless the Administrative Agent has received written notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring
to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a notice of default. In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, it shall give notice thereof to the Lenders. The
Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Majority Lenders; provided that unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions,
the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders. 
12.6 Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders. Each Lender expressly acknowledges that neither the Administrative Agent
nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates has made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by the Administrative Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs
of the Borrower or any other Credit Party, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by the Administrative Agent to any Lender, the Swingline Lender or any Letter of Credit Issuer. Each Lender, the Swingline Lender and each Letter
of Credit Issuer represents to the Administrative Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
appraisal of and investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and each other Credit Party and made its own decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter into this
Agreement. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance 
   108 





 
upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and
decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Borrower and any other Credit Party. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or
responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, assets, operations, properties, financial condition, prospects or creditworthiness of the Borrower or any other Credit Party that may come into the
possession of the Administrative Agent any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates. 
12.7 Indemnification. The Lenders agree to indemnify the Administrative Agent in its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by
the Credit Parties and without limiting the obligation of the Credit Parties to do so), ratably according to their respective portions of the Commitments or Loans, as applicable, outstanding in effect on the date on which indemnification is sought
(or, if indemnification is sought after the date upon which the Commitments shall have terminated and the Loans shall have been paid in full, ratably in accordance with their respective portions of the Total Exposure in effect immediately prior to
such date), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever that may at any time occur (including at any time following the payment
of the Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out of the Commitments, this Agreement, any of the other Credit Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein
or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided that no Lender shall be liable to the Administrative Agent for
the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the Administrative Agents gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct as
determined by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction (IT BEING THE INTENTION OF THE PARTIES HERETO THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND ANY RELATED PARTIES SHALL, IN ALL CASES, BE INDEMNIFIED FOR ITS ORDINARY, COMPARATIVE, CONTRIBUTORY
OR SOLE NEGLIGENCE); provided, further, that no action taken in accordance with the directions of the Majority Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be required by the Credit Documents) shall be deemed to
constitute gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct for purposes of this Section 12.7. In the case of any investigation, litigation or proceeding giving rise to any liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever that may at any time occur (including at any time following the payment of the Loans), this Section 12.7 applies whether any such investigation, litigation or
proceeding is brought by any Lender or any other Person. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse the Administrative Agent upon demand for its ratable share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including attorneys
fees) incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice rendered in
respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Credit Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent that the Administrative Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the
Borrower; provided that such reimbursement by the Lenders shall not affect the Borrowers continuing reimbursement obligations with respect thereto. If any indemnity furnished to the Administrative Agent for any purpose shall, in the
opinion of the Administrative Agent, be insufficient or become impaired, the Administrative Agent may call for additional indemnity and cease, or not commence, to do the acts indemnified against until such additional indemnity is furnished;
provided, in no event shall this sentence require any Lender to indemnify the Administrative Agent against any liability, obligation, loss, damage, 
   109 





 
penalty, action, judgment, suit, cost, expense or disbursement in excess of such Lenders pro rata portion thereof; and provided further, this sentence shall not be deemed to require
any Lender to indemnify the Administrative Agent against any liability, obligation, loss, damage, penalty, action, judgment, suit, cost, expense or disbursement resulting from the Administrative Agent gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct. The agreements in this Section 12.7 shall survive the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. 
12.8 Agent in Its Individual Capacity. The Administrative Agent and its Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and
generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower and any other Credit Party as though the Administrative Agent were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Credit Documents. With respect to the Loans made by it, the
Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the terms Lender and
Lenders shall include the Administrative Agent in its individual capacity.  12.9 Successor Agent. The Administrative
Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders, the Swingline Lender, the Letter of Credit Issuer and the Borrower. If the Administrative Agent and/or Swingline Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then such Administrative Agent
or Swingline Lender may be removed as the Administrative Agent or Swingline Lender, as the case may be, at the reasonable request of the Borrower and the Required Lenders. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation or removal, as the case may
be, the Majority Lenders shall have the right, subject to the consent of the Borrower (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) so long as no Default under Section 11.1 or 11.5 is continuing, to appoint a successor, which shall
be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States. If, in the case of the resignation of the Administrative Agent, no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Majority
Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the Administrative Agent may on behalf of the Lenders, the Swingline Lender and the Letter of Credit Issuer, appoint
a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above. Upon the acceptance of a successors appointment as the Administrative Agent hereunder, and upon the execution and filing or recording of such financing statements, or
amendments thereto, and such other instruments or notices, as may be necessary or desirable, or as the Majority Lenders may request, in order to continue the perfection of the Liens granted or purported to be granted by the Security Documents, such
successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations
hereunder or under the other Credit Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section). The fees payable by the Borrower (following the effectiveness of such appointment) to the successor Administrative Agent shall be
the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the retiring Administrative Agents resignation hereunder and under the other Credit Documents, the provisions of this
Section 12 (including Section 12.7) and Section 13.5 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or
omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as the Administrative Agent.  Any resignation of any
Person as Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section shall also constitute its resignation as Letter of Credit Issuer and Swingline Lender. Upon the acceptance of a successors appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, (a) such
successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Letter of Credit Issuer, (b) the retiring Letter of Credit Issuer shall be discharged from all of their respective duties and
obligations hereunder or under the other Credit Documents, and (c) the successor Letter of Credit Issuer shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other
arrangements satisfactory to the retiring Letter of Credit Issuer to effectively assume the obligations of the retiring Letter of Credit Issuer with respect to such Letters of Credit. 
   110 





 12.10 Withholding Tax. To the extent required by any applicable Requirement of Law, the
Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding tax. If the Internal Revenue Service or any authority of the United States or other jurisdiction asserts a claim that the
Administrative Agent did not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender (because the appropriate form was not delivered, was not properly executed, or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of
a change in circumstances that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax ineffective, or for any other reason), such Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent (to the extent that the Administrative Agent has not already
been reimbursed by any applicable Credit Party and without limiting the obligation of any applicable Credit Party to do so) fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as Tax or otherwise, including penalties,
additions to Tax and interest, together with all expenses incurred, including legal expenses, allocated staff costs and any out of pocket expenses. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at
any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Credit Document against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this Section 12.10. For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this Section 12.10, the term
Lender includes any Letter of Credit Issuer and any Swingline Lender.  12.11 Security Documents and Guarantee. Each
Secured Party hereby further authorizes the Administrative Agent, on behalf of and for the benefit of Secured Parties, to be the agent for and representative of the Secured Parties with respect to the Collateral and the Security Documents. Subject
to Section 13.1, without further written consent or authorization from any Secured Party, the Administrative Agent may (a) execute any documents or instruments necessary in connection with a Disposition of assets permitted by this
Agreement, (b) release any Lien encumbering any item of Collateral that is the subject of such Disposition of assets or with respect to which Majority Lenders (or such other Lenders as may be required to give such consent under
Section 13.1) have otherwise consented or (c) release any Guarantor from the Guarantee with respect to which Majority Lenders (or such other Lenders as may be required to give such consent under Section 13.1) have
otherwise consented.  12.12 Right to Realize on Collateral and Enforce Guarantee. Anything contained in any of the Credit Documents
to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each Secured Party hereby agree that (a) no Secured Party shall have any right individually to realize upon any of the Collateral or to enforce the Guarantee; it being
understood and agreed that all powers, rights and remedies hereunder may be exercised solely by the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Secured Parties in accordance with the terms hereof and all powers, rights and remedies under the Security
Documents may be exercised solely by the Administrative Agent, and (b) in the event of a foreclosure by the Administrative Agent on any of the Collateral pursuant to a public or private sale or other disposition, the Administrative Agent or any
Lender may be the purchaser or licensor of any or all of such Collateral at any such sale or other disposition and the Administrative Agent, as agent for and representative of the Secured Parties (but not any Lender or Lenders in its or their
respective individual capacities unless Majority Lenders shall otherwise agree in writing) shall be entitled, for the purpose of bidding and making settlement or payment of the purchase price for all or any portion of the Collateral sold at any such
public sale, to use and apply any of the Obligations as a credit on account of the purchase price for any collateral payable by the Administrative Agent at such sale or other disposition. 
12.13 Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim . In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy,
reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding, constituting an Event of Default under Section 11.5, the Administrative 
   111 





 
Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent
shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:  (a) to file
and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans and all other Indebtedness that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the
claims of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel, to the extent due
under Section 13.5) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and  (b) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable
or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;  and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar
official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, to
pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, to the extent due under Section 13.5. 
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any
Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Indebtedness or the rights of any Lender or to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding. 
SECTION 13. Miscellaneous

Administrative Agent shall, from time to time, (a) enter into with the relevant Credit Party or Credit Parties written amendments, supplements or modifications hereto and to the other Credit Documents for the purpose of adding any provisions to
this Agreement or the other Credit Documents or changing in any manner the rights of the Lenders or of the Credit Parties hereunder or thereunder or (b) waive in writing, on such terms and conditions as the Majority Lenders or the

such waiver and each such amendment, supplement or modification shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given; provided, further, that no such waiver and no such amendment, supplement or
modification shall (i) forgive or reduce any portion of any Loan or reduce the stated rate (it being understood that only the consent of the Majority Lenders shall be necessary to waive any obligation of the Borrower to pay interest at the
Default Rate or amend Section 2.8(e)), or forgive any portion, or extend the date for the payment, of any interest or fee payable hereunder (other than as a result of waiving the applicability of any post-default increase in interest
rates), or extend the final expiration date of any Lenders Commitment (provided that any Lender, upon the request of the 
   112 





 
Borrower, may extend the final expiration date of its Commitment without the consent of any other Lender, including the Majority Lenders) or extend the final expiration date of any Letter of
Credit beyond the L/C Maturity Date, or increase the amount of the Commitment of any Lender (provided that, any Lender, upon the request of the Borrower, may increase the amount of its Commitment without the consent of any other Lender,

which it is a party (except as permitted pursuant to Section 10.3) or alter the order of application set forth in the final paragraph of Section 11 or modify any definition used in such final paragraph if the effect thereof
would be to alter the order of payment specified therein, in each case without the written consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby, or (iii) amend, modify or waive any provision of Section 12 without the
written consent of the then-current Administrative Agent, as applicable, or any other former Administrative Agent to whom Section 12 then applies in a manner that directly and adversely affects such Person, or (iv) amend, modify or
waive any provision of Section 3 with respect to any Letter of Credit without the written consent of each Letter of Credit Issuer to whom Section 3 then applies in a manner that directly and adversely affects such Person, or

that a Scheduled Redetermination may be postponed by the Majority Lenders, or (x) affect the rights or duties of, or any fees or other amounts payable to the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any other Credit Document without the
prior written consent of the Administrative Agent; provided, further, that any provision of this Agreement or any other Credit Document may be amended by an agreement in writing entered into by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent
to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency so long as, in each case, the Lenders shall have received at least five Business Days prior written notice thereof and the Administrative Agent shall not have received, within five
Business Days of the date of such notice to the Lenders, a written notice from the Majority Lenders stating that the Majority Lenders object to such amendment. Any such waiver and any such amendment, supplement or modification shall apply equally to
each of the affected Lenders and shall be binding upon the Borrower, such Lenders, the Administrative Agent and all future holders of the affected Loans. In the case of any waiver, the Borrower, the Lenders and the Administrative Agent shall be
restored to their former positions and rights hereunder and under the other Credit Documents, and any Default or Event of Default waived shall be deemed to be cured and not continuing; it being understood that no such waiver shall extend to any
subsequent or other Default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon. In connection with the foregoing provisions, the Administrative Agent may, but shall have no obligations to, with the concurrence of any Lender, execute
amendments, modifications, waivers or consents on behalf of such Lender. 
   113

reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the preparation and execution and delivery of, and any amendment, waiver, supplement or modification to, this Agreement and the other Credit Documents and any

   114 





 
Borrower, any of its Related Parties or any other third Person, including reasonable and documented fees, disbursements and other charges of one primary counsel for all such Persons, taken as a
whole, and, if necessary, by a single firm of local counsel in each appropriate jurisdiction for all such Persons, taken as a whole (unless there is an actual or perceived conflict of interest in which case each such Person may, with the consent of
the Borrower (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) retain its own counsel), with respect to the execution, delivery, enforcement, performance and administration of this Agreement, the other Credit Documents and any such other documents,
including, without limitation, any of the foregoing relating to the violation of, noncompliance with or liability under, any Environmental Law (other than by such indemnified person or any of its Related Parties (other than any trustee or advisor))
or to any actual or alleged presence, release or threatened release of Hazardous Materials involving or attributable to the operations of the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries or any of the Oil and Gas Properties (all the foregoing in this clause
(d), collectively, the Indemnified Liabilities); provided that the Borrower shall have no obligation hereunder to the Administrative Agent or any Lender or any of their respective Related Parties with respect to
Indemnified Liabilities to the extent it has been determined by a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from (i) the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of the party to be indemnified
or any of its Related Parties (IT BEING THE INTENTION OF THE PARTIES HERETO THAT EACH LENDER, LETTER OF CREDIT ISSUER AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THEIR RESPECTIVE RELATED PARTIES SHALL, IN ALL CASES, BE INDEMNIFIED FOR ITS ORDINARY COMPARATIVE,
CONTRIBUTORY OR SOLE NEGLIGENCE), (ii) any material breach of any Credit Document by the party to be indemnified or (iii) disputes, claims, demands, actions, judgments or suits not arising from any act or omission by the Borrower or its
Affiliates, brought by an indemnified Person against any other indemnified Person (other than disputes, claims, demands, actions, judgments or suits involving claims against the Administrative Agent in its capacity as such). NO PERSON ENTITLED TO
INDEMNIFICATION UNDER CLAUSE (D) OF THIS SECTION 13.5 SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM THE USE BY UNINTENDED RECIPIENTS OF ANY INFORMATION OR OTHER MATERIALS DISTRIBUTED BY IT THROUGH TELECOMMUNICATIONS,
ELECTRONIC OR OTHER INFORMATION TRANSMISSION SYSTEMS IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS, ELECTRONIC OR OTHER INFORMATION TRANSMISSION SYSTEMS
USED BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT IS PROVIDED AS IS AND AS AVAILABLE. NONE OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR ANY OF ITS RELATED PARTIES WARRANT THE ADEQUACY OF SUCH TELECOMMUNICATIONS, ELECTRONIC OR OTHER INFORMATION TRANSMISSION
SYSTEMS AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM LIABILITY FOR ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN THE COMMUNICATIONS. NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS OR FREEDOM FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER CODE DEFECTS, IS MADE BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR ANY OF ITS RELATED PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH ANY COMMUNICATIONS OR ANY TELECOMMUNICATIONS, ELECTRONIC OR OTHER INFORMATION
TRANSMISSION SYSTEMS. No Person entitled to indemnification under clause (d) of this Section 13.5, nor the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, shall have any liability for any special, punitive, indirect, exemplary or
consequential damages (including, without limitation, any loss of profits, business or anticipated savings) relating to this Agreement or any other Credit Document or arising out of its activities in connection herewith or therewith (whether before
or after the Closing Date); provided that the foregoing shall not negate the Borrowers obligations with respect to Indemnified Liabilities. All amounts payable under this Section 13.5 shall be paid within 10 Business Days of
receipt by the Borrower of an invoice relating thereto setting forth such expense in reasonable detail. The agreements in this Section 13.5 shall survive repayment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. This

   115 





 13.6 Successors and Assigns; Participations and Assignments. 
(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the Letter of Credit Issuer that issues any Letter of Credit), except that (i) except as expressly permitted by Section 10.3, the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any
of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may
assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section 13.6. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto,
their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the Letter of Credit Issuer that issues any Letter of Credit), Participants (to the extent provided in clause (c) of this Section 13.6) and,
to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent, the Letter of Credit Issuer and the Lenders and each other Person entitled to indemnification under Section 13.5) any legal or
equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.  (b) (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in
clause (b)(ii) below, any Lender may at any time assign to one or more assignees (other than the Borrower, its Subsidiaries or any natural person) all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a
portion of its Commitments and the Loans (including participations in L/C Obligations or Swingline Loans) at the time owing to it) with the prior written consent (such consent not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; it being understood that the
Borrower shall have the right to withhold or delay its consent to any assignment solely if, in order for such assignment to comply with applicable Requirements of Law, the Borrower would be required to obtain the consent of, or make any filing or
registration with, any Governmental Authority) of:  (A) the Borrower; provided that no consent of the Borrower shall be required
for an assignment if an Event of Default under Section 11.1 or Section 11.5 has occurred and is continuing; and 
(B) the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender and each Letter of Credit Issuer (in each case, not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed).  (ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions: 
(A) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund or an assignment of the entire remaining
amount of the assigning Lenders Commitment or Loans, the amount of the Commitment or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment is
delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000 and increments of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, unless each of the Borrower, each Letter of Credit Issuer and the Administrative Agent otherwise consents (which consents shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided that no such consent of the Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default under Section 11.1 or Section 11.5 has occurred and is continuing; provided,
further, that contemporaneous assignments to a single assignee made by Affiliates of Lenders and related Approved Funds shall be aggregated for purposes of meeting the minimum assignment amount requirements stated above; 
   116 





 (B) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the
assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement;  (C) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the
Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a processing and recordation fee in the amount of $3,500; provided that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such processing and recordation fee
in the case of any assignment; and  (D) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an
Administrative Questionnaire.  (iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to clause (b)(iv) of this
Section 13.6, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights
and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an
Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.10,
2.11, 3.5, 5.4 and 13.5). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 13.6 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a
sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with clause (c) of this Section 13.6. 
(iv) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at the Administrative
Agents Office a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amount (and stated interest amounts) of the Loans and
L/C Obligations and any payment made by the Letter of Credit Issuer under any Letter of Credit owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register). Further, the Register shall contain the name and
address of the Administrative Agent and the lending office through which each such Person acts under this Agreement. The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Letter of Credit Issuer and the
Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by
the Borrower, the Letter of Credit Issuer, the Swingline Lender and, solely with respect to itself, each other Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. 
(v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignees
completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in clause (b) of this Section 13.6 (unless waived) and any written consent to
such assignment required by clause (b) of this Section 13.6, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Acceptance and record the information contained therein in the Register. 
(c) (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, any Swingline Lender or any Letter of Credit Issuer,
sell participations to one or more banks or other entities other than the Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower (each, a Participant) in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement
(including all or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans owing to it); provided that (A) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other
parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Letter of Credit 
   117 





 
Issuer and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or
instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any
other Credit Document; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in clauses (i) or
(ii) of the proviso to Section 13.1 that affects such Participant, provided that the Participant shall have no right to consent to any modification to the percentages specified in the definitions of the terms
Majority Lenders, Required Lenders or Borrowing Base Required Lenders. Subject to clause (c)(ii) of this Section 13.6, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits
of Sections 2.10, 2.11, 3.5 and 5.4 to the same extent as if it were a Lender (subject to the limitations and requirements of those Sections as though it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant
to clause (b) of this Section 13.6, including the requirements of clause (e) of Section 5.4). To the extent permitted by Requirements of Law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of
Section 13.8(b) as though it were a Lender; provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 13.8(a) as though it were a Lender. 
(ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.10, 2.11, 3.5 or 5.4
than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrowers prior written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld); provided that the Participant shall be subject to the provisions in Section 2.12 as if it were an assignee under clauses (a) and (b) of this Section 13.6.
Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each participant and the principal amounts (and related interest
amounts) of each participants interest in the Loans or other obligations under this Agreement (the Participant Register). The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, and such Lender
shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. No Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any
portion of the Participant Register to any Person (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Credit
Document) except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. 
(d) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all
or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or any central bank having jurisdiction over such Lender, and this
Section 13.6 shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any
such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. In order to facilitate such pledge or assignment or for any other reason, the Borrower hereby agrees that, upon request of any Lender at any time and from time to time after the Borrower
has made its initial borrowing hereunder, the Borrower shall provide to such Lender, at the Borrowers own expense, a promissory note, substantially in the form of Exhibit I-1 or I-2, as the case may be, evidencing the Loans and
Swingline Loans, respectively, owing to such Lender.  (e) Subject to Section 13.16, the Borrower authorizes each Lender to
disclose to any Participant, secured creditor of such Lender or assignee (each, a Transferee) and any prospective Transferee any and all financial information in such Lenders possession concerning the Borrower and its
Affiliates that has been delivered to such Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower and its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement or that has been delivered to such Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower and its Affiliates in connection with such
Lenders credit evaluation of the Borrower and its Affiliates prior to becoming a party to this Agreement. 
   118 





 (f) The words execution, signed, signature, and words of like
import in any Assignment and Acceptance shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or
the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and
Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.  13.7 Replacements of Lenders under
Certain Circumstances.  (a) The Borrower shall be permitted to replace any Lender that (i) requests reimbursement for amounts
owing pursuant to Section 2.10, 3.5 or 5.4, (ii) is affected in the manner described in Section 2.10(a)(iii) and as a result thereof any of the actions described in such Section is required to be taken or
(iii) becomes a Defaulting Lender, with a replacement bank, lending institution or other financial institution; provided that (A) such replacement does not conflict with any Requirement of Law, (B) no Event of Default under
Section 11.1 or 11.5 shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such replacement, (C) the replacement bank or institution shall purchase, at par, all Loans and the Borrower shall pay all other amounts (other than
any disputed amounts), pursuant to Section 2.10, 3.5 or 5.4, as the case may be) owing to such replaced Lender prior to the date of replacement, (D) the replacement bank or institution, if not already a Lender, and the
terms and conditions of such replacement, shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent (and if a Commitment is being assigned, the Letter of Credit Issuer), (E) the replaced Lender shall be obligated to make such replacement in
accordance with the provisions of Section 13.6(b) (provided that the Borrower shall be obligated to pay the registration and processing fee referred to therein) and (F) any such replacement shall not be deemed to be a waiver
of any rights that the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender shall have against the replaced Lender.  (b) If any Lender
(such Lender, a Non-Consenting Lender) (i) has failed to consent to a proposed amendment, waiver, discharge or termination that pursuant to the terms of Section 13.1 requires the consent of all of the Lenders
affected or the Required Lenders and with respect to which the Majority Lenders shall have granted their consent, or (ii) does not agree to increase its Commitment pursuant to Section 2.16 to the prior maximum level of its
Commitment before giving effect to any mandatory reduction in its Commitment pursuant to Section 5.2(c) (but after giving effect to any Assignment and Assumption occurring after such reduction), then provided no Event of Default then
exists, the Borrower shall have the right (unless such Non-Consenting Lender grants such consent) to replace such Non-Consenting Lender by requiring such Non-Consenting Lender to assign its Loans and its Commitments hereunder to one or more
assignees reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent (and if a Commitment is being assigned, the Letter of Credit Issuer); provided that: (i) all Obligations of the Borrower owing to such Non-Consenting Lender being replaced
(other than principal and interest) shall be paid in full to such Non-Consenting Lender concurrently with such assignment, and (ii) the replacement Lender shall purchase the foregoing by paying to such Non-Consenting Lender a price equal to the
principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. In connection with any such assignment, the Borrower, Administrative Agent, such Non-Consenting Lender and the replacement Lender shall otherwise comply with
Section 13.6.  (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each party hereto agrees that any assignment pursuant to
the terms of this Section 13.7 may be effected pursuant to an Assignment and Acceptance executed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the assignee and that the Lender making such assignment need not be a party thereto. 
   119 





 13.8 Adjustments; Set-off. 
(a) If any Lender (a benefited Lender) shall at any time receive any payment in respect of any principal of or interest on
all or part of the Loans made by it, or the participations in Letter of Credit Obligations held by it, or receive any collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature
referred to in Section 11.5, or otherwise), in a greater proportion than any such payment to or collateral received by any other Lender, if any, in respect of such other Lenders Loans, or interest thereon, such benefited Lender
shall (i) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (ii) purchase for cash at face value from the other Lenders a participating interest in such portion of each such other Lenders Loans, or shall provide such other Lenders
with the benefits of any such collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as shall be necessary to cause such benefited Lender to share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral or proceeds ratably in accordance with the aggregate principal of and
accrued interest on their respective Loans and other amounts owing them; provided, however, that, (A) if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such benefited Lender, such purchase shall
be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest and (B) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to (1) any payment made by the Borrower or any other
Credit Party pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, (2) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans,
Commitments or participations in Drawings to any assignee or participant or (3) any disproportionate payment obtained by a Lender as a result of the extension by Lenders of the maturity date or expiration date of some but not all Loans or
Commitments or any increase in the Applicable Margin in respect of Loans or Commitments of Lenders that have consented to any such extension. Each Credit Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under
Requirements of Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Credit Party rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a
direct creditor of such Credit Party in the amount of such participation.  (b) After the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event
of Default, in addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by Requirements of Law, each Lender shall have the right, without prior notice to the Borrower, any such notice being expressly waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted
by applicable Requirements of Law, upon any amount becoming due and payable by the Borrower hereunder or under any Credit Document (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) to set-off and appropriate and apply against such
amount any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or
unmatured, at any time held or owing by such Lender or any branch or agency thereof to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower (and the Credit Parties, if applicable) and the
Administrative Agent after any such set-off and application made by such Lender; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.

(a) it has been advised by counsel in the negotiation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents; 
   121 





 (b) (i) the credit facilities provided for hereunder and any related arranging or other services
in connection therewith (including in connection with any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Credit Document) are an arms-length commercial transaction between the Borrower and the other Credit Parties, on the one
hand, and the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, on the other hand, and the Borrower and the other Credit Parties are capable of evaluating and understanding and understand and accept the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions
contemplated hereby and by the other Credit Documents (including any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or thereof); (ii) in connection with the process leading to such transaction, each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
is and has been acting solely as a principal and is not the financial advisor, agent or fiduciary for any of the Borrower, any other Credit Parties or any of their respective Affiliates, equity holders, creditors or employees or any other Person;
(iii) neither the Administrative Agent, any Joint Bookrunner, any Joint Lead Arranger, nor any Lender has assumed or will assume an advisory, agency or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Borrower or any other Credit Party with respect to

provided and none will provide any legal, accounting, regulatory or tax advice with respect to any of the transactions contemplated hereby (including any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Credit Document) and the
Borrower has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it has deemed appropriate. The Borrower hereby waives and releases, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims that it may have against the
Administrative Agent with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty; and  (c) no joint venture is created hereby
or by the other Credit Documents or otherwise exists by virtue of the transactions contemplated hereby among the Lenders or among the Borrower, on the one hand, and any Lender, on the other hand. 
13.15 WAIVERS OF JURY TRIAL. THE BORROWER, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, EACH LETTER OF CREDIT ISSUER AND EACH LENDER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENT AND FOR ANY COUNTERCLAIM THEREIN. 
13.16 Confidentiality. The Administrative Agent, each other Agent, any Letter of Credit Issuer, the Swingline Lender and each other
Lender shall hold all non-public information furnished by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with such Lenders evaluation of whether to become a Lender hereunder or obtained by such Lender, the Swingline
Lender, the Administrative Agent, any Letter of Credit Issuer or such other Agent pursuant to the requirements of this Agreement (Confidential Information), confidential in accordance with its customary procedure for handling
confidential information of this nature and in any event may make disclosure (a) as required or requested by any Governmental Authority, self-regulatory agency or representative thereof or pursuant to legal process or applicable Requirements of
Law, (b) to such Lenders or the Administrative Agents, any 
   122 





 
Letter of Credit Issuers or such other Agents attorneys, professional advisors, independent auditors, trustees or Affiliates, in each case who need to know such information in
connection with the administration of the Credit Documents and are informed of the confidential nature of such information, (c) to an investor or prospective investor in a securitization that agrees its access to information regarding the
Credit Parties, the Loans and the Credit Documents is solely for purposes of evaluating an investment in a securitization and who agrees to treat such information as confidential, (d) to a trustee, collateral manager, servicer, backup servicer,
noteholder or secured party in connection with the administration, servicing and reporting on the assets serving as collateral for a securitization and who agrees to treat such information as confidential, and (e) to a nationally recognized
ratings agency that requires access to information regarding the Credit Parties, the Loans and Credit Documents in connection with ratings issued with respect to a securitization; provided that unless specifically prohibited by applicable
Requirements of Law, each Lender, the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender, any Letter of Credit Issuer and each other Agent shall endeavor to notify the Borrower (without any liability for a failure to so notify the Borrower) of any request
made to such Lender, the Administrative Agent, any Letter of Credit Issuer or such other Agent, as applicable, by any governmental, regulatory or self-regulatory agency or representative thereof (other than any such request in connection with an
examination of the financial condition of such Lender by such governmental agency) for disclosure of any such non-public information prior to disclosure of such information; provided further that in no event shall any Lender, the
Administrative Agent, any Letter of Credit Issuer or any other Agent be obligated or required to return any materials furnished by the Borrower or any Subsidiary. In addition, each Lender, the Administrative Agent and each other Agent may provide
Confidential Information to prospective Transferees or to any pledgee referred to in Section 13.6 or to prospective direct or indirect contractual counterparties in Hedge Agreements to be entered into in connection with Loans made
hereunder as long as such Person is advised of and agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Section 13.16 or confidentiality provisions at least as restrictive as those set forth in the Section 13.16. 
13.17 Release of Collateral and Guarantee Obligations. 
(a) The Lenders hereby irrevocably agree that the Liens granted to the Administrative Agent by the Credit Parties on any Collateral shall be
automatically released (i) in full, as set forth in clauses (b) or (c) below, (ii) upon the Disposition of such Collateral (including as part of or in connection with any other Disposition permitted hereunder) to any Person other
than another Credit Party, to the extent such Disposition is made in compliance with the terms of this Agreement (and the Administrative Agent may rely conclusively on a certificate to that effect provided to it by any Credit Party upon its
reasonable request without further inquiry), (iii) to the extent such Collateral is comprised of property leased to a Credit Party, upon termination or expiration of such lease, (iv) if the release of such Lien is approved, authorized or
ratified in writing by the Majority Lenders (or such other percentage of the Lenders whose consent may be required in accordance with Section 13.1), (v) to the extent the property constituting such Collateral is owned by any
Guarantor, upon the release of such Guarantor from its obligations under the Guarantee (in accordance with the second succeeding sentence and Section 5.14(b) of the Guarantee) and (vi) as required by the Administrative Agent to effect any
Disposition of Collateral in connection with any exercise of remedies of the Administrative Agent pursuant to the Security Documents. Any such release shall not in any manner discharge, affect, or impair the Obligations or any Liens (other than
those being released) upon (or obligations (other than those being released) of the Credit Parties in respect of) all interests retained by the Credit Parties, including the proceeds of any Disposition, all of which shall continue to constitute part
of the Collateral except to the extent otherwise released in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Documents. Additionally, the Lenders hereby irrevocably agree that the Guarantors shall be released from the Guarantees upon consummation of
any transaction permitted hereunder resulting in such Subsidiary ceasing to constitute a Restricted Subsidiary or otherwise becoming an Excluded Subsidiary. The Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent to execute and deliver any
instruments, documents, and agreements necessary or desirable to evidence and confirm 
   123 





 
the release of any Guarantor or Collateral pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, all without the further consent or joinder of any Lender. Any representation, warranty or
covenant contained in any Credit Document relating to any such Collateral or Guarantor shall no longer be deemed to be repeated.  (b)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or any other Credit Document, when all Obligations (other than (i) Hedging Obligations in respect of any Secured Hedge Agreements, (ii) Cash Management Obligations in respect of any
Secured Cash Management Agreements and (iii) any contingent or indemnification obligations not then due) have been paid in full, all Commitments have terminated or expired and no Letter of Credit shall be outstanding that is not Cash
Collateralized or back-stopped, upon request of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall (without notice to, or vote or consent of, any Secured Party) take such actions as shall be required to release its security interest in all Collateral, and
to release all obligations under any Credit Document, whether or not on the date of such release there may be any (i) Hedging Obligations in respect of any Secured Hedge Agreements, (ii) Cash Management Obligations in respect of any
Secured Cash Management Agreements and (iii) any contingent or indemnification obligations not then due. Any such release of Obligations shall be deemed subject to the provision that such Obligations shall be reinstated if after such release
any portion of any payment in respect of the Obligations guaranteed thereby shall be rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of the Borrower or any Guarantor, or
upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, the Borrower or any Guarantor or any substantial part of its property, or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made.
 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or any other Credit Document, upon the Borrowers election to enter
into an Investment Grade Period pursuant to Section 13.23(a) and delivery of the written notice contemplated therein, the Administrative Agent shall (without notice to, or vote or consent of, any Secured Party) take such actions as shall
be required to release its security interest in all Collateral, and to release all obligations under any Security Document.  13.18 USA
PATRIOT Act. The Administrative Agent and each Lender hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the Patriot
Act), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each Credit Party, which information includes the name and address of each Credit Party and other information that will allow the Administrative Agent and such
Lender to identify each Credit Party in accordance with the Patriot Act.  13.19 Payments Set Aside. To the extent that any payment
by or on behalf of the Borrower is made to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, or the Administrative Agent or any Lender exercises its right of setoff, and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently
invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent or such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in
connection with any proceeding or otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been
made or such setoff had not occurred, and (b) each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand its applicable share of any amount so recovered from or repaid by the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the
date of such demand to the date such payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect. 
   124 





 13.20 Reinstatement. This Agreement shall continue to be effective, or be reinstated, as
the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any of the Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution,
liquidation or reorganization of the Borrower, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, the Borrower or any substantial part of its property, or otherwise, all as
though such payments had not been made.  13.21 Disposition of Proceeds. The Security Documents contain an assignment by the
Borrower and/or the Guarantors unto and in favor of the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders of all of the Borrowers or each Guarantors interest in and to their as-extracted collateral in the form of production and all
proceeds attributable thereto which may be produced from or allocated to the Mortgaged Property. The Security Documents further provide in general for the application of such proceeds to the satisfaction of the Obligations described therein and
secured thereby. Notwithstanding the assignment contained in such Security Documents, until the occurrence of an Event of Default, (a) the Administrative Agent and the Lenders agree that they will neither notify the purchaser or purchasers of
such production nor take any other action to cause such proceeds to be remitted to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, but the Lenders will instead permit such proceeds to be paid to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and (b) the Lenders
hereby authorize the Administrative Agent to take such actions as may be necessary to cause such proceeds to be paid to the Borrower and/or such Subsidiaries. 
13.22 Collateral Matters; Hedge Agreements. The benefit of the Security Documents and of the provisions of this Agreement relating to
any Collateral securing the Obligations shall also extend to and be available on a pro rata basis to any Person (a) under any Secured Hedge Agreement, in each case, after giving effect to all netting arrangements relating to such Hedge
Agreements or (b) under any Secured Cash Management Agreement; provided that, with respect to any Secured Hedge Agreement or Secured Cash Management Agreement that remains secured after the Hedge Bank thereto or the Cash Management Bank
thereunder is no longer a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender, the provisions of Section 12 shall also continue to apply to such Hedge Bank or Cash Management Bank in consideration of its benefits hereunder and each such Hedge Bank or
Cash Management Bank, as applicable, shall, if requested by the Administrative Agent, promptly execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent all such other documents, agreements and instruments reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent to
evidence the continued applicability of the provisions of Section 12. No Person shall have any voting rights under any Credit Document solely as a result of the existence of obligations owed to it under any such Secured Hedge Agreement
or Secured Cash Management Agreement.  13.23 Investment Grade Election. 
(a) At any time that is not an Investment Grade Period, on any date on which the Borrower has either (i) an unsecured rating from
Moodys of Baa3 or better or (ii) an unsecured rating from S&P of BBB- or better, the Borrower may provide written notice to the Administrative Agent of its election to enter into an Investment Grade Period, together with a certificate
of an Authorized Officer of the Borrower confirming that (A) no Event of Default exists, (B) the release of the Security Documents securing the Obligations does not violate the terms of any Secured Hedge Agreement or Secured Cash
Management Agreement, and (C) the Hedge Agreements (including the Secured Hedge Agreements) and the Cash Management Agreements (including any Secured Cash Management Agreements) of the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not otherwise
secured (except to the extent secured by a Permitted Lien), which Investment Grade Period will commence upon the Administrative Agents receipt of such notice. 
(b) At any time during an Investment Grade Period, the Borrower may provide notice to the Administrative Agent of its election to exit such
Investment Grade Period, which Investment Grade Period will end upon the Administrative Agents receipt of such notice. 
   125 





 13.24 Existing Credit Agreement. On the Closing Date, this Agreement shall supersede and
replace in its entirety the Existing Credit Agreement; provided, however, that (a) all loans, letters of credit, and other indebtedness, obligations and liabilities outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement on such date shall continue to
constitute Loans, Letters of Credit and other indebtedness, obligations and liabilities under this Agreement, (b) the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any of the Credit Documents hereunder shall not constitute a novation, refinancing
or any other fundamental change in the relationship among the parties and (c) the Loans, Letters of Credit, and other indebtedness, obligations and liabilities outstanding hereunder, to the extent outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement
immediately prior to the date hereof, shall constitute the same loans, letters of credit, and other indebtedness, obligations and liabilities as were outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement. 
13.25 Reaffirmation and Grant of Security Interest. Each Credit Party hereby (a) confirms that each Security Instrument (as
defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) to which it is a party or is otherwise bound and all Collateral encumbered thereby, will continue to guarantee or secure, as the case may be, to the fullest extent possible in accordance with the Credit
Documents, the payment and performance of all Obligations under this Agreement and the Secured Obligations (as such term is defined in the Security Instruments) under the Security Instruments, as the case may be, including without limitation the
payment and performance of all such Obligations under this Agreement and the Secured Obligations under the Security Instruments, and (b) reaffirms its grant to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties of a continuing Lien
on and security interest in and to such Credit Partys right, title and interest in, to and under all Collateral as collateral security for the prompt payment and performance in full when due of the Obligations under this Agreement and the
Secured Obligations under the Security Instruments (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) in accordance with the terms thereof. 
13.26 Reallocation of Commitments. The Lenders (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) have agreed among themselves to reallocate
the Aggregate Commitment (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) as contemplated by this Agreement and to adjust their interests in the Aggregate Commitment and the Revolving Loans (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) accordingly. On
the Closing Date and after giving effect to such reallocation and adjustment of such Commitment and such Loans, the Lenders shall hold the Commitments set forth on Schedule 1.1(a). The outstanding Revolving Loans (as defined in the Existing
Credit Agreement) and the funds delivered to the Administrative Agent on the Closing Date by the Lenders shall be allocated such that after giving effect to such allocation each of the Lenders shall hold the Commitments set forth on Schedule
1.1(a) and such Lenders shall own the Loans consistent with their percentage of the Commitments set forth on Schedule 1.1(a). The Borrower shall pay any funding indemnification amounts required by Section 2.16 of the Existing
Credit Agreement in the event the payment of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) or the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto is required
in connection with the reallocation contemplated by this Section 13.26.
