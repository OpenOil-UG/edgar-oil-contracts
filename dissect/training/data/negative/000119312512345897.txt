 ###EMPLOYEE_GRANT_VEST_SCHEDULE_TABLE###  This DIRECTOR STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT (this Agreement) is made by and between Harvest Natural
Resources, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company), and ###PARTICIPANT_NAME### (the Grantee) as of the ###ISSUE_DATE### (the Grant Date). 
WHEREAS, the Company desires to grant to the Grantee, for his service as a member of the Board of Directors of the
Company (a Director), the stock unit award specified herein (the Award), subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and  WHEREAS, the Award is not a stock value right as that term is defined in Treasury Regulation §31.3121(v)(2)-1(b)(4)(ii) so the Award constitutes a
deferral of compensation for purposes of section 3121(v)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; and 
WHEREAS, the Grantee desires to have the opportunity to hold the Award, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement;  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, mutual covenants and
agreements contained herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows:

the applicable date as reported by the New York Stock Exchange or the principal stock exchange on which the Stock is then traded. The Stock Units that are awarded hereby to the Grantee shall be
subject to the prohibitions and restrictions set forth herein with respect to the sale or other disposition of such Stock Units and the obligation to forfeit and surrender such Stock Units to the Company (the Forfeiture
Restrictions). In accepting the award of Stock Units set forth in this Agreement the Grantee accepts and agrees to be bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

Agreement, if subsequent to the Grant Date the stockholders of the Company approve an equity compensation plan under which the Stock Units may be paid in the medium of Stock, the Committee may in the future, in its sole discretion, determine (by any
means so determined by the Committee in its sole discretion) to cause all or any portion of the Stock Units to be paid in the medium of Stock. Any fractional shares will be paid in cash.

Capital Adjustments and Reorganizations.

The existence of the Stock Units shall not affect in any way the right or power of the Company to make or authorize any adjustment, recapitalization, reorganization or
other change in its capital structure or its business, engage in any merger or consolidation, issue any debt or equity securities, dissolve or liquidate, or sell, lease, exchange or otherwise dispose of all or any part of its assets or business, or

(b)
If the Company shall effect a subdivision or consolidation of the Stock or other capital readjustment, the payment of a stock dividend with respect to the Stock, or
other increase or reduction of the number of shares of the Stock outstanding, without receiving compensation therefore in money, services or property, then the number of Stock Units awarded under this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted in the
same manner as if the Grantee was the holder of an equivalent number of shares of the Stock immediately prior to the event requiring the adjustment.   


8.
Not a Service Agreement. This Agreement is not a service agreement, and no provision of this Agreement shall be construed or interpreted to create a
service relationship between the Grantee and the Board, the Company, its subsidiaries or any of its Affiliates or guarantee the right to remain a Director for any specified term. 
 


9.
Notices. Any notice, instruction, authorization, request or demand required hereunder shall be in writing, and shall be delivered either by

executed by the Company and the Grantee. Only a written instrument executed and delivered by the party waiving compliance hereof shall waive any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement. Any waiver granted by the Company shall be effective only
if executed and delivered by a duly authorized executive officer of the Company other than the Grantee. The failure of any party at any time or times to require performance of any provisions hereof shall in no manner effect the right to enforce the
same. No waiver by any party of any term or condition, or the breach of any term or condition contained in this Agreement, in one or more instances, shall be construed as a continuing waiver of any such condition or breach, a waiver of any other
condition, or the breach of any other term or condition.   


11.
Governing Law and Severability. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Texas without regard to its conflicts of law
provisions. The invalidity of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.

No Rights as Stockholder. Unless and until shares of Stock are issued to the Grantee under this Agreement, the Grantee shall have no rights as a
stockholder as a result of this Award.
