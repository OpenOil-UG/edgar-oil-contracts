made by the Borrower and each of the other Obligors in favor of the Administrative Agent (as heretofore amended, modified or supplemented,

C.           The
Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders have agreed to amend certain provisions of the Credit Agreement as more fully
set forth herein.

 

D.           NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants herein contained, for good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 

Section
1.          Defined Terms. Each capitalized term which is defined

    Page 1
     
    

 

“Agreement”
means this Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, including the Schedules and Exhibits hereto, as amended by the First Amendment,
the Second Amendment, the Third Amendment, the Fourth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, and as the same may be amended, modified
or supplemented from time to time.

 

(b)          The
definition of “Indebtedness” is hereby amended by adding the following proviso in place of the period at the end thereto:

 

“;
provided, however, that the definition of ‘Indebtedness’ shall not create any guarantee by any Guarantor of (or grant
of security interest by any Guarantor to support, as applicable) any Excluded Swap Obligations of such Guarantor for purposes of
determining any obligations of any Guarantor.”

 

(c)          The
following definitions are hereby added where alphabetically appropriate to read as follows:

 

“Commodity
Exchange Act” means the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.), as amended from time to time, and any
successor statute.

 

“Excluded
Swap Obligation” means, with respect to any Guarantor, any Swap Obligation if, and to the extent that, all or a portion
of the guarantee of such Guarantor of, or the grant by such Guarantor of a security interest to secure, such Swap Obligation (or
any guarantee thereof) is or becomes illegal under the Commodity Exchange Act or any rule, regulation or order of the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission (or the application or official interpretation of any thereof) (a) by virtue of such Guarantor’s
failure for any reason to constitute an “eligible contract participant” as defined in the Commodity Exchange Act and
the regulations thereunder at the time the guarantee of such Guarantor or the grant of such security interest becomes or would
become effective with respect to such obligation or liability in respect of a Secured Hedge Agreement or (b) in the case of
an obligation or liability in respect of a Secured Hedge Agreement that is required to be cleared pursuant to Section 2(h)
of the Commodity Exchange Act (or any successor provision thereto), because such Guarantor is a “financial entity,”
as defined in Section 2(h)(7)(C)(i) the Commodity Exchange Act (or any successor provision thereto), at the time the guarantee
of (or grant of security interest by, as applicable) such Guarantor becomes or would become effective with respect to such Swap
Obligation. If a Swap Obligation arises under a master agreement governing more than one Swap Agreement, such exclusion shall apply
only to the portion of such Swap Obligation that is attributable to Swap Agreements for which such guarantee or security interest
is or becomes illegal.

 

“Fifth
Amendment” means that certain Fifth Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of August 7,
2013, among the Borrower, the Guarantors, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders party thereto.

 

“Fifth
Amendment Effective Date” has the meaning set forth in the Fifth Amendment.

 



    Page 2
     
    

 

“Qualified
ECP Guarantor” means, in respect of any Swap Obligation, the Borrower and each Guarantor that, at the time the relevant
guaranty obligation or other liability (or grant of the relevant security interest, as applicable) becomes or would become effective
with respect to such obligation or liability, has total assets exceeding $10,000,000 or otherwise constitutes an “eligible
contract participant” under the Commodity Exchange Act or any regulations promulgated thereunder and can cause another person
to qualify as an “eligible contract participant” with respect to such Swap Obligation at such time by entering into
a keepwell pursuant to section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the Commodity Exchange Act.

 

“Swap
Obligation” shall mean, with respect to any person, any obligation to pay or perform under any Swap Agreement.

 

2.2           Amendment
to Article VIII.

 

(a)          Article
VIII is hereby amended by inserting the following new Section 8.18 at the end thereto:

 

“Section
8.18         Keepwell. The Parent will, and will cause each Qualified ECP Guarantor
to, provide such funds or other support as may be needed from time to time by the Borrower or each Guarantor to honor all of its
obligations under this Agreement or any Swap Agreements (provided, however, that each Qualified ECP Guarantor shall only be liable
under this Section 8.18 for the maximum amount of such liability that can be hereby incurred without rendering its obligations
under this Section 8.18 or otherwise voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and
not for any greater amount). The obligations of each Qualified ECP Guarantor under this Section 8.18 shall remain in full force
and effect until payment in full of the Indebtedness and the termination of this Agreement. The Borrower intends that this Section
8.18 constitute, and this Section 8.18 shall be deemed to constitute, a “keepwell, support, or other agreement” for
the benefit of each other Credit Party for all purposes of section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the Commodity Exchange Act.”	

 

2.3           Amendments
to Section 9.01.

 

(a)          Section
9.01(a) is hereby amended in its entirety to read as follows:

 

(a)          Ratio
of Total Debt to EBITDAX. The Parent will not, as of any date of determination from and after March 31, 2015, permit its ratio
of Total Debt as of such date to EBITDAX for the most recent period of four fiscal quarters for which financial statements are
available to be greater than 4.25 to 1.0.

 

(b)          Section
9.01(c) is hereby added which reads in its entirety as follows:

 

(c)          Ratio
of Senior Secured Funded Debt to EBITDAX. The Parent will not, as of any date of determination from and after the Fifth Amendment

Section
3.          Additional Amendment to Credit Agreement Upon Approval
of All Lenders. If the Administrative Agent shall have received executed counterpart signature pages to this Amendment from
all of the Lenders, then Section 10.02(c) of the Credit Agreement is hereby further amended by inserting the following new sentence
immediately following the paragraph that begins with the word “fifth”:

 

“Notwithstanding
the foregoing, amounts received from the Borrower or any other Guarantor that is not a Qualified ECP Guarantor shall not be applied
to any Excluded Swap Obligations.”

 

Section
4.          Conditions Precedent. This Fifth Amendment shall become
effective on the date (such date, the “Fifth Amendment Effective Date”) when each of the following conditions
is satisfied (or waived in accordance with Section 12.02):

 

4.1           The
Administrative Agent shall have received from the Majority Lenders and the Obligors counterparts (in such number as may be requested
by the Administrative Agent) of this Fifth Amendment signed on behalf of such Persons.

 

4.2           Both
before and immediately after giving effect to this Fifth Amendment, no Default shall have occurred and be continuing.

 

4.3           The
Administrative Agent shall have received such other documents as the Administrative Agent or its special counsel may reasonably
require.

 

The Administrative
Agent is hereby authorized and directed to declare this Fifth Amendment to be effective (and the Fifth Amendment Effective Date
shall occur) when it has received documents confirming or certifying, to the satisfaction of the Administrative Agent, compliance
with the conditions set forth in this Section 4 or the waiver of such conditions as permitted in Section 12.02. Such declaration
shall be final, conclusive and binding upon all parties to the Credit Agreement for all purposes.

 

For the avoidance of
doubt, the amendment to Section 10.02(c) of the Credit Agreement set forth in Section 3 of this Amendment shall only be implemented
if (a) the Fifth Amendment Effective Date shall have occurred and (b) the Administrative Agent shall have received executed counterpart
signature pages to this Amendment from all of the Lenders and the Obligors.

each Loan Document remains in full force and effect as expressly amended hereby; (c) agrees that from and after the Fifth Amendment
Effective Date each reference to the Credit Agreement in the Guaranty Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be deemed to

material respects (without duplication of materiality), except to the extent any such representations and warranties are expressly

respects (without duplication of materiality) as of such specified earlier date, (ii) no Default has occurred and is continuing
and (iii) no event, development or circumstance has have occurred or exists that has resulted in, or could reasonably be expected
to have, a Material Adverse Effect.

This Fifth Amendment may be executed by one or more of the parties hereto in any number of separate counterparts, and all of such
counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a
signature page of this Fifth Amendment by telecopy, facsimile or email transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart of this Fifth Amendment.

 

5.4           No
Oral Agreement. This Fifth Amendment, the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents executed in connection herewith and
therewith represent the final agreement between the parties and may not be contradicted by evidence of prior, contemporaneous,

5.7           Severability.
Any provision of this Fifth Amendment which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and

other jurisdiction.
