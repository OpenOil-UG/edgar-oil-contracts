<PAGE>

WHEREAS,  the  Parties  desire to jointly  explore  and  develop  the  Objective
Horizons and any other prospective targets within the joint development area, as
hereinafter defined, as outlined below.

NOW, THEREFORE,  for and in consideration of the sum of ten dollars ($10.00) and
other good and valuable consideration,  the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby   acknowledged  and  confessed,   together  with  the  mutual  covenants,
conditions and obligations contained herein, the Parties agree as follows:

                         I. JOINT DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT

1.1   The Parties hereby agree to enter into a Joint Development  Agreement (the
      "Agreement")  covering  a joint  development  area (the  "Contract  Area")
      established between the Parties covering the following portion of WC 77:

                West Cameron Block 77: S/2N/2SW/4 and N/2S/2SW/4

      Insofar,  and  only  insofar,  as the  Contract  Area  is  limited  to the
      following depths:

      From  the  surface  down  to  but  not  including  the  depths  below  the
      stratigraphic  equivalent seen at a two way time of 3861 ms (approximately
      16,400' SSTVD) on the Fairfield 3D Pre-Stack  Time Migration  In-Line 3170
      at CrossLine 1600;

      In the event the Test Well is drilled and does not encounter  hydrocarbons
      in commercial  quantities  (sufficient to satisfy 30 CFR 250.115 or 30 CFR
      250.116),  or the  participating  parties  agree not to complete  the Test
      Well, then the Contract Area shall terminate,

1.2   A fixed interest  allocation of fifty-six  percent (56%) to the S/2N/2SW/4
      of WC 77 and forty-four  percent (44%) to the N/2S/2SW/4 of WC 77 shall be
      utilized for the


                                        2
<PAGE>

      allocation of drilling and completion costs, operating costs, platform and
      facilities  costs  required to produce  well(s) from the Contract Area and
      working interest  ownership of production and reserves  developed.  Unless
      agreed otherwise, there shall be no equity interest redetermination within
      the Contract  Area.  Based upon the current  ownership and proposed  fixed
      interest  allocation,  the working interest  ownership within the Contract
      Area shall be as follows:

              BHP               43.66%
              Dominion          22.40%
              THEX              19.40%
              Ridgewood         14.54%

                                  II. TEST WELL

2.1   Subject to the limitations set out herein, BHP shall commence, or cause to
      be commenced on or before December 1, 2004, the drilling of an approximate
      16,200' SSTVD ("Test  Well").  BHP shall be designated  operator under the
      Operating   Agreement  (defined  in  Article  111  below)  and  shall  use
      reasonable  efforts to commence actual drilling of the Test Well,  subject
      to rig availability and obtaining all requisite permits.

2.2   The Test Well is deemed to be an  Exploratory  Well for the Contract Area,
      as  referred  to in Article 10 of the  Operating  Agreement  described  in
      Article III below. An AFE and well plan for the Test Well will be provided
      to each of the Parties for their election in accordance  with the terms of
      the Operating  Agreement.  In the event that the Test Well is proposed and
      drilled in  accordance  with this  Article,  the interest of any party not
      electing to  participate in the drilling of the Test Well shall be subject
      to the  production  reversion  penalties as set forth in Article 13.2.1 of
      the Operating Agreement.


                                       3
<PAGE>

2.3   In the event the Test Well  should  encounter  rock salt,  heaving  shale,
      excessive water flow,  excessive  pressure,  igneous or other impenetrable
      formation or conditions at a lesser depth which would render impracticable
      and preclude the Test Well from reaching the Objective Depth,  then and in
      such event any party to the Operating  Agreement  described in Article III
      below may propose  within sixty (60) days  following  abandonment  of such
      well the drilling of a substitute well  ("Substitute  Well") provided same
      is  drilled  to the same  objective  zone or zones as the Test  Well,  The
      proposing party shall provide the  non-proposing  parties of its intent to
      drill a Substitute  Well,  along with an AFE for the Substitute  Well. The
      AFE for the Substitute Well shall include,  at a minimum,  the surface and
      bottomhole location of the Substitute Well and the estimated costs for the
      Substitute Well as a dry hole and as a producer. The non-proposing parties
      shall have thirty (30) days, or forty-eight (48) hours in the event that a
      rig is on location,  from receipt of such written  notice to elect whether
      it shall  participate in such Substitute  Well.  Failure to respond within
      the  time  period  allowed  shall  be  deemed  to be an  election  not  to
      participate in the Substitute Well.

      If one (1) or more party with a combined  working interest in the Contract
      Area of 14% or greater elect to participate in the Substitute  Well,  then
      the Operator shall commence the drilling of the Substitute  Well within 60
      days and this Joint  Development  Agreement shall remain in full force and
      effect as though the  Substitute  Well was the Test Well. In the event the
      Operator  of the  Test  Well  becomes  a  Non-Participating  Party  in the
      Substitute  Well, the  Participating  Parties in the Substitute Well shall
      designate a new  operator in  accordance  with the terms of the  Operating
      Agreement.  Accordingly,  in the event that no proposal is made to drill a
      Substitute  Well  within  the time frame  provided  above,  the  requisite
      percentage to participate in the Substitute  Well is not reached or in the
      event that the drilling of the  Substitute  Well is not timely  commenced,
      then  the  Parties'  rights  and  further  obligations  under  this  Joint
      Development Agreement shall terminate.

      In the  event  that  the  Substitute  Well  is  proposed  and  drilled  in
      accordance  with this  Article,  the interest of any party not electing to
      participate in the drilling of the


                                       4
<PAGE>

      Substitute Well shall be subject to the production  reversion penalties as
      set out in Article 13.2.1 of the Operating Agreement as described below.

                        III. OFFSHORE OPERATING AGREEMENT

3.1   Subject to the terms and provisions of this  Agreement,  all operations on
      the Test Well, any Substitute  Well, and all subsequent  operations on the
      Contract  Area  shall  be  conducted  in  accordance  with the  terms  and
      provisions of the Offshore  Operating  Agreement  dated  September 1, 2004
      attached hereto as Exhibit "A" (the "Operating Agreement").  The Operating
      Agreement shall supercede and replace all previous operating agreements to
      which the Parties may be subject,  insofar and only insofar as they relate
      to the drilling of the Test Well and other operations  within the Contract
      Area.  In the  event  there is a  conflict  between  a  provision  of this
      Agreement and the Operating Agreement,  the applicable  provisions of this
      Agreement shall prevail to the extent of such conflict.

                       IV. CONTRACTUAL INTEREST OWNERSHIP

4.1   For the  purposes of this  Agreement,  the Parties  will each retain their
      respective  Record Title and/or  Operating Rights Interest in and to their
      respective  portions of WC 77  contributed  to the Contract  Area.  By the
      execution  of, and for the  duration of this  contract  and the  Operating
      Agreement,  the parties  will own a  contractual  interest in each other's
      respective portions of WC 77 contributed to the Contract Area. The Parties
      agree to execute and file of record in the appropriate  venue a Memorandum
      of  Joint  Development   Agreement,   Operating  Agreement  and  Financing
      Statement to recognize and notice the formation of this  Agreement.  There
      shall be no obligation for any cross assignment of interest.

      Non- Participating  Party to any operation  hereunder which is burdened by
      any Additional Burdens,  then the Parties assuming the contractual working
      interest share of the Non-Participating  Party shall bear their respective
      share of  Additional  Burdens  which  the  Non-Participating  Party  would
      otherwise be subject to.

5.2   All other  overriding  royalties or other burdens  created by any Party to
      this  Agreement,  other  than those set out as  Additional  Burdens on the
      attached  Exhibit "B", shall be considered a  subsequently  created burden
      and shall be borne  solely by the Party  creating  same,  with said  Party
      holding the remaining  Parties  harmless in the event said Party becomes a
      Non-Participating Party.

5.3   Any royalty relief secured from the MMS as to Lessor's royalty upon either
      of the respective lands contributed to the Contract Area shall be credited
      to the  participating  Parties  of the  qualifying  well  based upon their
      contractual working interest ownership as set out hereinabove. The Parties
      recognize  that there may be competing  production  for the royalty relief
      and that any royalty  suspension  shall be applied in accordance  with the
      MMS order creating the relief.

6.1   This Agreement and its respective  Exhibits  hereto,  set forth the entire
      agreement of the Parties  relating to the Contract Area and the Test Well,

                             VII. TERM OF AGREEMENT

7.1   This  Agreement  shall be effective as of the  execution by all Parties of
      this Agreement.  In the event the Test Well or Substitute Well therefor is
      drilled and is  qualified  by the  Minerals  Management  Service as a well
      capable of producing in accordance  with 30 CFR 250.115 or 30 CFR 250.116,
      or upon mutual  agreement by the  participating  Parties,  this  Agreement
      shall be continued in force and effect for a sufficient  period of time to
      allow production  facilities to be installed and production  commenced and
      so  long  thereafter  as  oil or gas is  produced.  This  Agreement  shall
      terminate  when oil and gas is no longer being  produced from the Contract
      Area  or  drilling  or  well-reworking  operations  are  no  longer  being
      conducted  with  lapses of no more than 180 days per  lapse  between  such
      producing,  drilling or well-reworking operations on the Contract Area and

8.1   Delay Rentals & Minimum  Royalty.  The Parties hereby agree that BHP shall
      maintain  responsibility  for the payment of minimum royalties on WC 77 in
      the same percentages as are currently paid under the existing West Cameron

              Operation), the Operator conducts a Non-consent Operation in which
              it is a Non-participating Party, it shall follow the practices and
              standards   in   Article   5   (Exclusive   Right   to   Operate).
              Notwithstanding  anything  to the  contrary  in Exhibit  "C",  the
              Operator  shall not be  required to proceed  with the  Non-consent
              Operation until the Participating  Parties have advanced the total
              estimated costs of the Non-consent Operation to the Operator.  The
              Operator  shall never be  obligated to expend any of its own funds
              for the Non-consent  Operation in which it is a  Non-participating
              Party.

      4.2.3   Appointment of a Substitute Operator

              After  expiration  of all  applicable  response  periods  for  the
              Non-consent Operation and selection of a substitute Operator, each
              Party shall  promptly  provide the  substitute  Operator  with the
              appropriate  MMS  designation of operator forms and designation of
              oil spill  responsibility  forms.  The Operator and the substitute
              Operator  shall  coordinate  the change of  operatorship  to avoid
              interfering  with  ongoing  activities  and  operations,  if  any,
              including  but not limited to, lease  maintenance  activities  and
              operations.

      4.2.4   Redesignation of Operator

              Within  fifteen  (15) days  after  conclusion  of the  Non-consent
              Operation, all Parties shall execute and provide the Operator with
              the  appropriate MMS designation of operator forms and designation
              of oil spill  responsibility  forms to return  operatorship to the
              Operator,  thereby  superseding  the Parties'  designation  of the
              substitute   Operator  under  Article  4.2.3   (Appointment  of  a
              Substitute Operator).

4.3   Resignation of Operator

      Subject to Article 4.5 (Selection of  Successor),  the Operator may resign
      at any time by giving  written  notice  to the  Parties,  except  that the
      Operator may not resign during a Force Majeure or an emergency  that poses
      a threat to life, safety,  property,  or the environment.  If the Operator
      ceases to own a Working  Interest,  the  Operator  automatically  shall be
      deemed  to  have  resigned  as the  Operator  without  any  action  by the
      Non-operators.

4.4   Removal of Operator

      Operator  may be removed by an  affirmative  vote of the Parties  owning a
      combined  Working Interest of fifty percent (50%) or more of the remaining
      Working Interest after excluding the Operator's Working Interest if:

      (a)     Operator  becomes  insolvent  or  unable  to pay its debts as they
              mature, makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors,  commits
              an act of bankruptcy, or seeks relief under laws providing for the
              relief of debtors;

      (b)     a receiver is appointed for Operator or for  substantially  all of
              its property or affairs;

      (c)     a Transfer  of  Interest by the  Operator  (excluding  an interest
              assigned to an Affiliate)  reduces the Operator's Working Interest
              to less than the  Working  Interest  of a Non-  operator,  whether
              accomplished by one or more Transfer of Interest.

      (d)     Operator commits a substantial  breach of a material  provision of
              this Agreement and fails to cure the breach within sixty (60) days
              after notice of the breach.

      If a petition for relief under the federal  bankruptcy laws is filed by or
      against Operator,  and if a federal  bankruptcy court prevents the removal
      of Operator,  all  Non-operators  and Operator  shall  comprise an interim
      operating  committee  to operate  until  Operator has elected to reject or
      assume this Agreement  under the Bankruptcy  Code. An election by Operator
      as a  debtor-in-possession  or by a trustee in  bankruptcy  to reject this
      Agreement  shall be deemed to be a  resignation  by  Operator  without any
      action by the  Non-operators,  except the selection of a successor.  To be
      effective, a vote to remove Operator for any cause described above must be
      taken  within  thirty  (30)  days  after a  Non-operator  receives  actual
      knowledge  of the  cause.  A change  of  corporate  name or  structure  of
      Operator or a transfer of Operator's  interest to a single Affiliate shall
      not be deemed to be a resignation or basis for removing Operator.  Subject
      to  Article  8.6.2  (Default)  &  Article  8.6.3  (Unpaid  Charges),   the
      resignation or removal of Operator  shall become  effective at the earlier
      of (a) 7:00 a.m.  on the first day of the  calendar  month  following  the
      expiration  of ninety (90) days after the giving of notice of  resignation
      by Operator or action by Non-operators to remove Operator, or (b) the time
      when a successor Operator assumes the duties of Operator.

4.5   Selection of Successor

      Upon  resignation  or removal of Operator,  a successor  Operator shall be
      selected from among the Parties by an affirmative  vote of two (2) or more
      Parties having a combined Working Interest of


                                       15
<PAGE>

      fifty percent  (50%) or more.  If the resigned or removed  Operator is not
      entitled to vote, fails to vote, or votes only to succeed itself, then the
      successor  Operator  shall  be  selected  by the  affirmative  vote of the
      Parties owning a combined  Working Interest of fifty percent (50%) or more
      of the remaining  Working Interest after excluding the Working Interest of
      the resigned or removed Operator. If the Operator assigns all or a part of
      its Working Interest,  then under Article 4.3 (Resignation of Operator) or
      Article  4.4.(c),  the  Party  who  acquired  all or a part of the  former
      Operator's  Working  Interest  shall not be  excluded  from  voting  for a
      successor  Operator.  If there are only two Parties to this Agreement when
      the Operator resigns or is removed,  then the  Non-operator  automatically
      has the right, but not the obligation, to become the Operator. If no Party
      is willing to become the Operator,  this Agreement  shall  terminate under
      Article 27.1 (Term).

4.6   Effective Date of Resignation or Removal

      The resignation or removal of the Operator shall become  effective as soon
      as  practical  but no later  than 7:00 a.m.  on the first day of the month
      following  a period of ninety (90) days after the date of  resignation  or
      removal,  unless a longer  period is  required  for the  Parties to obtain
      approval of the  designation  of the successor  Operator,  and  designated
      applicant for oil spill  financial  responsibility  purposes,  by the MMS;
      however,  in no event shall the  resignation or removal of Operator become
      effective  until a successor  Operator has assumed the duties of Operator.
      The  resignation  or removal of the outgoing  Operator shall not prejudice
      any rights,  obligations,  or liabilities resulting from its operatorship.
      The successor  Operator may charge the Joint Account for reasonable  costs
      incurred in  connection  with copying or obtaining  the former  Operator's
      records,  information  or data except when the change of Operator  results
      from a merger,  consolidation,  reorganization  or sale or  transfer to an
      Affiliate of the Operator.

4.7   Delivery of Property

      On the  effective  date of  resignation  or removal of the  Operator,  the
      outgoing  Operator  shall  deliver or transfer to the  successor  Operator
      custodianship  of the Joint Account and possession of all items  purchased
      for the Joint Account under this Agreement,  all Hydrocarbons that are not
      the  separate  property  of  a  Party,  all  equipment,   materials,   and
      appurtenances purchased for the Joint Account under this Agreement,  which
      are not already in the possession of the successor Operator.  The outgoing
      Operator  shall  further  use its  reasonable  efforts to  transfer to the
      successor  Operator,  as of  the  effective  date  of the  resignation  or
      removal,  its rights as Operator under all contracts  exclusively relating
      to the activities or operations  conducted under this  Agreement,  and the
      successor  Operator shall assume all  obligations of the Operator that are
      assignable  under the  contracts.  The Parties may audit the Joint Account
      and conduct an inventory of all property and all Hydrocarbons that are not
      the separate  property of a Party,  and the inventory shall be used in the
      accounting to all Parties by the outgoing Operator of the property and the
      Hydrocarbons  that are not the separate property of a Party. The inventory
      and audit shall be conducted under Exhibit "C".

      exclusive  right  and duty to  conduct  operations  (or  cause  them to be
      conducted)  under  this  Agreement.  In  performing  services  under  this
      Agreement  for  the  Non-operators,   Operator  shall  be  an  independent
      contractor,  not subject to the  control or  direction  of  Non-operators,
      except for the type of operation to be undertaken  in accordance  with the
      voting and election procedures in this Agreement. No Party shall be deemed
      to be, or hold itself out as, the agent or fiduciary of another Party.

5.2   Workmanlike Conduct

      Operator  shall timely  commence and conduct all  operations in a good and
      workmanlike  manner, as would a prudent operator under the same or similar
      circumstances.  OPERATOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO  NON-OPERATORS  FOR LOSSES
      SUSTAINED OR LIABILITIES  INCURRED,  EXCEPT AS MAY RESULT FROM  OPERATOR'S
      GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL  MISCONDUCT.  Operator shall never be required
      under this  Agreement  to conduct an operation  that it believes  would be
      unsafe or would  endanger  persons,  property or the  environment.  Unless
      otherwise  provided  in  this  Agreement,   Operator  shall  consult  with
      Non-operators and keep them informed of all important matters.

5.3   Liens and Encumbrances

      Operator  shall  endeavor to keep the  Contract  Area,  wells,  Platforms,
      Development Facilities,  and other equipment free from all liens and other
      encumbrances occasioned by operations hereunder,  except those provided in
      Article 8.6 (Security Rights).

5.4   Employees and Contractors

      Operator  shall select  employees  and  contractors  and  determine  their
      number, hours of labor, and compensation. The employees shall be employees
      of Operator.

5.5   Records

      The Operator shall keep or cause to be kept accurate books,  accounts, and
      records of  activities or  operations  under this  Agreement in compliance
      with the Accounting Procedure in Exhibit "C". Unless otherwise provided in
      this  Agreement,  all records of the Joint Account shall be available to a
      Non-operator as provided in Exhibit "C". The Operator shall use good-faith
      efforts to ensure the settlements,  billings, and reports rendered to each
      Party under this Agreement are complete and accurate.

5.6   Compliance

      Operator  shall comply,  and shall require all agents and  contractors  to
      comply,  with all  applicable  laws,  rules,  regulations,  and  orders of
      governmental authorities having jurisdiction.

5.7   Contractors

      Operator  may  enter  into  contracts   with  qualified  and   responsible
      independent  contractors  for  the  design,  construction,   installation,
      drilling,  production  or operation of wells,  Platforms  and  Development
      Facilities. Insofar as possible, Operator shall use competitive bidding to
      procure  goods and services  for the benefit of the Parties.  All drilling
      operations  conducted  under this Agreement shall be conducted by properly
      qualified and responsible  drilling  contractors under current competitive
      contracts.  A drilling contract will be deemed to be a current competitive
      contract  if it  (a)  was  made  within  twelve  (12)  months  before  the
      commencement  of the well and (b) contains  terms,  rates,  and provisions
      that,  when  the  contract  was  made,  did  not  exceed  those  generally
      prevailing in the area for operations involving  substantially  equivalent
      rigs  that are  capable  of  conducting  the  drilling  operation.  At its
      election,  Operator may use its own or an Affiliate's  drilling equipment,
      derrick barge, tools, or machinery to conduct drilling operations, but the
      work shall be (i)  performed  by  Operator or its  Affiliate  acting as an
      independent  contractor,  (ii)  approved  by  written  agreement  with the
      Participating   Parties  before  commencement  of  operations,   and (iii)
      conducted under the same terms and conditions and at the same rates as are
      customary and prevailing in  competitive  contracts of third parties doing
      work of similar nature.

5.8   Governmental Reports, Litigation and/or Administrative Proceedings

      Operator shall make reports to  governmental  authorities it has a duty to
      make  as  Operator  and  shall  furnish  copies  of  the  reports  to  the
      Participating  Parties.  Operator  shall give timely written notice to the
      Parties of litigation  and/or  administrative  proceedings of which it has
      notice affecting the Contract Area or operations hereunder.

5.9   Information to Participating Parties

      Except  as  provided  in  Article  8.6,   Operator   shall   furnish  each
      Participating  Party the following  information,  if applicable,  for each
      activity or operation conducted by Operator:

              during the drilling of the well; and, upon completion of the well,
              a composite of all electrical-type  logs, insofar as is reasonable
              and customary.

              the depths from which they were taken,  and shipped at the expense
              of  the  requesting  Party  by  express  courier  to  the  address
              designated by the requesting Party.

              jurisdiction.

      5.9.10  Upon written  request,  other pertinent  information  available to
              Operator,  including,  but not limited to,  those  portions of the
              contracts  to be used for the  benefit  of the Joint  Account  and
              which pertain to the Contract  Area,  but excluding the Operator's
              proprietary   or   secret    information    and   its   subsurface
              interpretations.

5.10  Information to Non-participating Parties

      Operator  shall  furnish  each  Non-participating  Party  a copy  of  each
      Operator's  governmental  report  that  is  available  to the  public  and
      associated with the applicable Non-consent Operation. Until the applicable
      recoupment  under  Article 13  (Non-consent  Operations)  is  complete,  a
      Non-participating  Party shall not receive or review any other information
      specified by Article 5.9 (Information to Participating Parties), except as
      may be necessary for a payout audit of the Non-consent Operation.

      6.1.2   Vote Required

              Unless expressly stated to the contrary herein, a matter requiring

              of two (2) or more Parties  having a combined  voting  interest of
              fifty-one  percent  (51 %) or  more.  If  there  are  only two (2)
              Parties to this


                                       19
<PAGE>

              Agreement,  the matter shall be  determined  by the Party having a
              majority  voting  interest  or, if the  interests  are equal,  the
              matter shall require unanimous consent.

      6.1.3   Votes

              The  Parties  may  vote  at  a  meeting;  by  telephone,  promptly
              confirmed  in writing to Operator;  or by facsimile  transmission.

              but the  agenda  and items  included  in the agenda may be amended

              Parties.

                                    ARTICLE 7

                                     ACCESS

7.1   Access to Contract Area

      Except as provided in Article 8.6,  each Party shall have  access,  at its
      sole risk and expense and at all reasonable  times,  to the Contract Area,
      Platform,  Development  Facilities  and Joint  Account  assets to  inspect
      activities,  operations  and  wells  in  which  it  participates,  and  to
      pertinent  records and data. A  Non-operator  shall give Operator at least
      twenty-four  (24) hours' notice of the  Non-operator's  intention to visit
      the  Contract  Area.  To  protect  Operator  and  the  Non-operators  from
      unnecessary lawsuits,  claims, and legal liability, if it is necessary for
      a person who is not performing  services for Operator  directly related to
      the joint operations, but is performing services solely for a Non-operator
      or pertaining to the business or operations of a  Non-operator,  to visit,
      use, or board a rig, well, Platform, or Development  Facilities subject to
      this Agreement, the Non-operator shall give Operator advance notice of the
      visit,  use, or boarding,  and shall secure from that person an agreement,
      in a form satisfactory to Operator,  indemnifying and holding Operator and
      Non-operators harmless, or shall itself provide the same hold harmless and
      indemnification  in favor of Operator and other  Non-operators  before the
      visit, use, or boarding.

7.2   Reports

      On  written  request,  Operator  shall  furnish  a  requesting  Party  any
      information not otherwise  furnished under Article 5 (Authority and Duties
      of Operator) to which that Party is entitled under


                                       20
<PAGE>

      this  Agreement.  The costs of gathering and  furnishing  information  not
      furnished  under  Article  5 shall be  charged  to the  requesting  Party.
      Operator  is  not  obligated  to  furnish  interpretative  data  that  was

      7.5 (Limited Releases to Offshore Scout  Association),  Article 7.6 (Media

      for  Sale  of  Production),   and  except  for  necessary  disclosures  to
      governmental  authorities  having  jurisdiction,  or  except  as agreed in
      writing by all Participating Parties, no Party or Affiliate shall disclose
      Confidential Data to a third party.

7.4   Limited Disclosure

      A Party may make  Confidential  Data to which it is  entitled  under  this
      Agreement available to:

      (a)     outside professional  consultants and reputable  engineering firms
              for the purpose of evaluations and/or submitting bids;

      (b)     gas  transmission  companies  for  Hydrocarbon  reserve  or  other
              technical evaluations;

      (c)     reputable  financial  institutions for study before  commitment of

              assets of that Party or an Affiliate of that Party; and

      (g)     an Affiliate of a Party.

7.6   Media Releases

      Except as  unanimously  agreed by the  Participating  Parties or otherwise
      permitted by this  Article,  no Party shall issue a news or media  release
      about operations on the Contract Area. In an emergency involving extensive
      property or environmental damage,  operations failure, loss of human life,
      or other  clear  emergency,  and for which there is  insufficient  time to
      obtain  the prior  approval  of the  Parties,  Operator  may  furnish  the
      minimum, strictly factual, information necessary to satisfy the legitimate
      public  interest  of  the  media  and  governmental   authorities   having
      jurisdiction. Operator shall then promptly advise the other Parties of the
      information furnished in response to the emergency.

      7.6.1   Required Media Releases

              Notwithstanding   anything  to  the  contrary  contained  in  this
              Agreement,  should  a Party  be  required  to make a news or media
              release  concerning   operations  covered  by  this  Agreement  in
              compliance  with any laws,  orders,  rules and  regulations of any
              federal, state, local government authority or stock exchange, said
              Party may release such information.  Any required release shall be
              delivered to all  Participating  Parties within  forty-eight  (48)
              hours before being issued.

                                    ARTICLE 8

                                  EXPENDITURES

 8.1  Basis of Charge to the Parties

      Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement,  Operator shall pay all
      costs  incurred  under  this  Agreement,  and each Party  shall  reimburse
      Operator  in  proportion  to  its  Participating  Interest.  All  charges,
      credits,  and accounting for expenditures  shall be made and done pursuant
      to Exhibit "C".

 8.2  AFEs

      Before  undertaking  an operation or making a single  expenditure to be in
      excess  of  One  Hundred  Thousand  Dollars   ($100,000.00),   and  before
      conducting an activity or operation to drill, Sidetrack, Deepen, Complete,
      Rework or Recomplete a well (regardless of the estimated  cost),  Operator
      shall submit an AFE for the  operation or  expenditure  to the Parties for
      approval.  Operator shall also furnish an informational AFE to all Parties
      for an  operation  or single  expenditure  estimated  to cost One  Hundred
      Thousand  Dollars  ($100,000.00)  or less, but in excess of Fifty Thousand
      Dollars  ($50,000.00).  Operator shall notify the Participating Parties as
      soon  as  reasonably  possible  when it  appears  the  cost of an  ongoing
      activity or operation,  prior to its completion,  will exceed the original
      AFE by more than 10 percent  (10%) or Two Hundred Fifty  Thousand  Dollars
      ($250,000.00),  whichever  is the  greater  amount.  This  overexpenditure
      notice shall be furnished to


                                       22
<PAGE>

      the Participating Parties as a supplemental AFE for informational purposes
      only and is not subject to an election by any of the Parties.

8.3   Emergency and Required Expenditures

      Notwithstanding  anything in this  Agreement to the contrary,  Operator is
      hereby  authorized to conduct  operations  and incur  expenses that in its
      opinion are  reasonably  necessary to safeguard  life,  property,  and the
      environment  in  case  of an  actual  or  imminently  threatened  blowout,
      explosion, accident, fire, flood, storm, hurricane,  catastrophe, or other
      emergency, and the expenses shall be borne by the Participating Parties in
      the  affected  operation.  Operator  shall  report  to  the  Participating
      Parties,  as promptly as  possible,  the nature of the  emergency  and the
      action taken.  Operator is also authorized to conduct operations and incur
      expenses  reasonably  required by statute,  regulation,  order,  or permit
      condition  or  by a  governmental  authority  having  jurisdiction,  which
      expenses  shall be  borne by the  Participating  Parties  in the  affected
      operation, subject to Exhibit "C".

8.4   Advance Billings

      Operator  may  require  each  Party to  advance  its  respective  share of
      estimated expenditures pursuant to Exhibit "C".

8.5   Commingling of Funds

      Funds received by Operator under this Agreement may be commingled with its
      own funds.

8.6   Security Rights (Louisiana)

      Exhibit "H" (LOUISIANA)

8.7   Overexpenditures

      Operator  shall  notify the  Participating  Parties  when it appears  that
      actual  expenditures  for  an  approved  operation  in an  Exploratory  or
      Development  Well or for the design,  construction,  and installation of a
      Platform  (other  than  a  Platform  that  solely   supports   Development
      Facilities)   will  exceed  the  AFE   estimate   (the  excess   being  an
      "Overexpenditure"). If it appears that the Overexpenditure will be no more
      than the greater of Two Hundred Fifty Thousand  Dollars  ($250,000.00)  or
      fifteen  percent  (15%),  or in the  case of an  operation  involving  the
      design,  construction,  and  installation  of a Platform,  or  Development
      Facilities,  no more than the  greater of Five  Hundred  Thousand  Dollars
      ($500,000.00)  or  ten  percent  (10%),  hereinafter  referred  to as  the
      "Allowable Variance," Operator's notice shall be forwarded for information
      only.  If Operator  determines  that the  Overexpenditure  will exceed the
      Allowable  Variance,  Operator  shall  submit  a new AFE  for the  current
      operation  ("Supplemental AFE") for approval of the Participating Parties.
      The   Participating   Parties  may  then  elect  whether  to  continue  to
      participate  within thirty (30) days or forty-eight (48) hours if a rig is
      on location, exclusive of Saturdays,  Sundays, and federal holidays, after
      receipt of the  Supplemental  AFE. If fewer than all,  but one (1) or more
      Participating  Parties  elect to  continue to  participate  in the current
      operation  and  agree to pay and bear one  hundred  percent  (100%) of the
      costs and risks of conducting it, Operator shall continue to conduct


                                       23
<PAGE>

      the  current   operation.   Otherwise,   the  operation   shall  cease.  A
      Participating  Party that  elects not to continue  to  participate  in the
      current operation shall become a Non-participating Party in the operation,
      from and after the date when the  Overexpenditure  exceeds  the  Allowable
      Variance,   not  including  emergency   expenditures,   and  Article  13.2
      (Relinquishment  of Interest)  shall apply to the Party only to the extent
      that the costs of the  operation  exceed the  Allowable  Variance.  Unless
      otherwise agreed by the Participating  Parties,  each Participating  Party
      electing to continue to participate  in the current  operation may, but is
      not  obligated  to,  pay and bear  that  portion  of the  costs  and risks
      attributable  to the  interests  of the  Non-participating  Parties in the
      ratio that the Participating Party's interest bears to the total interests
      of all  Participating  Parties  electing to continue  participating in the
      current operation.  If it appears to Operator that actual expenditures for
      an approved operation will exceed the Supplemental AFE estimate,  Operator
      shall again repeat the  procedure of this Article 8.8,  using the estimate
      in  the  most  recently  approved   Supplemental  AFE  as  the  basis  for
      determining  the  Overexpenditure  and  Allowable  Variance.   An  initial
      Participating Party in an operation shall remain responsible for its share
      of all  costs  and  risks  for  plugging,  replugging,  capping,  burying,
      disposing,   abandoning,  removing,  and  restoring  associated  with  the
      operation,  subject to Article 14  (Abandonment,  Salvage,  and  Surplus),
      regardless of its subsequent election on a Supplemental AFE, except to the
      extent such costs were  increased  by  subsequent  operations  in which it
      elected not to  participate.  Notwithstanding  anything in this Article to
      the  contrary,  if  expenditures  exceed  the  Allowable  Variance  for an
      emergency,   as   provided  in  Article  8.3   (Emergency   and   Required
      Expenditures),  Operator  shall not be required to secure the  approval of
      the  Participating  Parties,  as the  expenditures  will be  borne  by all
      Participating  Parties.   However,  once  stabilization  takes  place  and
      emergency  expenditures  are no  longer  being  incurred,  Operator  shall
      promptly furnish a Supplemental AFE to the Participating Parties for their
      review and election, as provided above.

      transmission,  with postage and charges prepaid,  addressed to the Parties
      at the  addresses in Exhibit  "A".  When a drilling rig is on location and
      standby charges are accumulating,  however,  notices pertaining to the rig
      shall be given  orally or by  telephone.  All  telephone  or oral  notices
      permitted by this Agreement shall be confirmed  immediately  thereafter by
      written notice.  A notice shall be deemed to have been delivered only when

      notified,  and for written notice,  means actual delivery of the notice to
      the address of the Party to be notified,  as specified in this  Agreement,

      of same.  When a response is required in  forty-eight  (48) hours or less,
      however,  the response  shall be given orally or by telephone or facsimile
      transmission  within  that  period.  If a Party is  unavailable  to accept
      delivery of a notice  required  to be given  orally or by  telephone,  the
      notice may be delivered by any other method specified in this Article 9.1.
      A message  left on an answering  machine or with an  answering  service or
      other third person shall not be deemed to be adequate  telephonic  or oral
      notice.

      the well.  If a proposed  operation  is subject  to Article  13.11  (Lease
      Maintenance  Operations),  the notice shall specify that the proposal is a
      Lease Maintenance  Operation.  A proposal for multiple  operations on more
      than one well  location  by the same rig shall  contain  separate  AFEs or
      notices for each  operation and shall specify in writing in what order the
      operations  will be  conducted.  Each Party shall respond to each proposed
      multiple  operation in the manner  provided in Article 9.3.3 (Proposal for
      Multiple Operations).

                                       25
<PAGE>

              but if (a) a drilling rig is on location, (b) the proposal relates
              to the same well or its  substitute,  and (c) standby  charges are
              accumulating,  a response  shall be made within  forty-eight  (48)
              hours  after  receipt of the  proposal,  exclusive  of  Saturdays,
              Sundays, and federal holidays.

      9.3.3   Proposal for Multiple Operations

9.4   Failure to Respond

      Failure  of a Party to respond to a  proposal  or notice,  to vote,  or to
      elect to participate within the period required by this Agreement shall be
      deemed to be a negative response, vote, or election.

9.5   Response to Counterproposals

      Should a  counterproposal  be allowed under this  Agreement,  responses to
      that  counterproposal  must be made  within  the  response  period for the
      original proposal.

9.6   Timely Well Operations

      Unless otherwise provided,  an approved well shall be commenced within one
      hundred twenty (120) days after the date when the last applicable election
      on that well may be made.  Wells shall be deemed to have  commenced on the
      day charges  commence  under the drilling  contract for that well.  If the
      Operator does not commence the drilling of an approved well within the one
      hundred twenty (120) day time frame,  the other  Participating  Parties in
      that well may select a substitute  Operator to drill the approved well. In
      all events, including the occurrence of a Force Majeure, if the substitute
      Operator fails to commence actual drilling  operations on an approved well
      within one  hundred  fifty (150) days from the  proposal  of the  approved
      well,  the  proposal of the well and its  approval  will be deemed to have
      been withdrawn. Subject to Exhibit "C", if a proposal for a well is deemed
      to have been  withdrawn,  all costs incurred in the  preparation for or in
      furtherance  of that well will be  chargeable  to the Parties who voted to
      participate in the well proposal for that well.

9.7   Timely Platform/Development Facilities Operations

      Unless otherwise provided,  Operator shall commence, or cause to commence,
      the  construction,  acquisition,  or refurbishment of an approved proposal
      for a Platform  and/or  Development  Facilities  within one hundred  fifty
      (150)  days  after  the date  when the last  applicable  election  on that
      Platform  and/or  Development  Facilities may be made.  The  construction,
      acquisition,  or refurbishment of an approved Platform and/or  Development
      Facilities proposal shall be deemed to have commenced


                                       26
<PAGE>

      on  the  date  the  contract  is  awarded  for  the  design,  acquisition,
      fabrication,   or  refurbishment   of  the  Platform  and/or   Development
      Facilities.   If  the  Operator   does  not  commence  the   construction,
      acquisition,  or refurbishment of an approved Platform and/or  Development
      Facilities proposal within the one hundred fifty (150) day time frame, the
      other Participating Parties in that Platform and/or Development Facilities
      proposal may select a substitute  Operator to commence the Platform and/or
      Development Facilities. In all events, including the occurrence of a Force
      Majeure,  if the substitute  Operator fails to commence the  construction,
      acquisition,  or refurbishment of an approved Platform and/or  Development
      Facilities  within one hundred  fifty (150) days from the  proposal of the
      approved  Platform  and/or  Development  Facilities,  the  proposal of the
      Platform and/or  Development  Facilities and their approval will be deemed
      to have been withdrawn.  Subject to Exhibit "C",  regardless of whether or
      not the construction,  acquisition,  or refurbishment of a Platform and/or
      Development  Facilities  is  commenced,  all costs  incurred by  Operator,
      attributable to that activity, shall be paid by the Participating Parties.

                             EXPLORATORY OPERATIONS

10.1  Proposing Operations

      Subject to the provisions of the JDA, any Party may propose an Exploratory
      Operation in accordance  with Article 9 (Notices) to the other Parties who
      are entitled to vote or make an election in regard to that operation.

10.2  Counterproposals

      When an  Exploratory  Operation is proposed,  a Party may,  within fifteen
      (15) days after  receipt of the AFE or notice for the  original  proposal,
      make a counterproposal to conduct an alternative  Exploratory Operation by
      sending an AFE or notice to such  Parties  in  accordance  with  Article 9
      (Notices).  The AFE or  notice  shall  indicate  that  the  proposal  is a
      counterproposal to the original proposal.  If one or more counterproposals
      are  made,  such  Parties  shall  elect  to  participate  in the  original
      proposal,  one  counterproposal,  or neither the  original  proposal nor a
      counterproposal.  If two or more  proposals  receive  the  approval of the
      number of Parties and combined Working Interests  required by Article 10.5
      (Operations by Fewer Than All Parties), the proposal receiving the largest
      percentage of Working Interest approval shall take precedence,  and in the
      event of a tie between two (2) or more  approved  proposals,  the proposal
      first  received  by the  Parties  shall  take  precedence.  Except for the
      response period provided in this Article 10.2, a counterproposal  shall be
      subject to the same terms and conditions as the original proposal.

10.3  Operations by All Parties

      If all Parties elect to  participate in the proposed  operation,  Operator
      shall conduct the operation at their cost and risk.

10.4  Second Opportunity to Participate

      If there are more than two (2) Parties to this Agreement and if fewer than
      all but one (1) or more  Parties  having a combined  Working  Interest  of
      fourteen  percent (14%) or more elect to  participate,  then the proposing
      Party shall notify the Parties of the  elections  made,  whereupon a Party
      originally  electing not to  participate  may then elect to participate by
      notifying the proposing Party within forty-eight (48) hours,  exclusive of
      Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays, after receipt of such notice. If
      all Parties elect to participate in the proposed operation, Operator shall
      conduct the  operation  at their cost and risk.  If there are only two (2)
      Parties to this Agreement, then there shall not be a second opportunity to
      elect to  participate,  and if the  Participating  Party agrees to pay and
      bear one hundred  percent  (100%) of the costs and risks of the operation,
      then the Operator,  subject to Article 4.2  (Substitute  Operator),  shall
      conduct the  operation as a  Non-consent  Operation for the benefit of the
      Participating  Party,  and  the  provisions  of  Article  13  (Non-consent
      Operations) shall apply.

10.5  Operations by Fewer Than All Parties

      If there are more than two (2) Parties to this Agreement,  then, after the
      election  made under  Article 10.4 (Second  Opportunity  to  Participate),
      fewer  than  all but one (1) or more  Parties  having a  combined  Working
      Interest of fourteen  percent (14%) or more have elected to participate in
      the proposed operation, the proposing Party shall notify the Participating
      Parties,  and each Participating  Party shall have forty-eight (48) hours,
      exclusive of Saturdays,  Sundays,  and federal holidays,  after receipt of
      the notice to notify the proposing Party of the portion of costs and risks
      attributable to the total  Non-participating  Parties' interests it elects
      to pay and bear.  Unless  otherwise agreed by the  Participating  Parties,
      each Participating  Party may, but shall not be obligated to, pay and bear
      that   portion  of  the  costs  and  risks   attributable   to  the  total
      Non-participating  Parties'  interests in the ratio that the Participating
      Party's interest bears to the total interests of all Participating Parties
      who elect to pay and bear a portion of costs and risks attributable to the
      total  Non-participating  Parties' interests.  Failure to respond shall be
      deemed to be an election not to pay or bear any additional costs or risks.
      If the  Participating  Parties  agree to pay and bear one hundred  percent
      (100%)  of the  costs and risks of the  operation,  Operator,  subject  to
      Article  4.2  (Substitute  Operator),  shall  conduct the  operation  as a
      Non-consent  Operation for the benefit of the Participating  Parties,  and
      the provisions of Article 13 (Non-consent Operations) shall apply. If such
      agreement is not obtained,  however,  the operation shall not be conducted
      and the effect shall be as if the proposal had not been made.

10.6  Expenditures Approved

      Approval  of  an   Exploratory   Operation   shall  cover  all   necessary
      expenditures  associated with the operation  proposed in the AFE or notice
      that are  incurred by Operator in  connection  with (a)  preparations  for
      drilling;  (b) the actual  drilling;  (c)  evaluations,  such as  testing,
      coring,  and logging;  and (d) plugging  and  abandonment,  subject to any
      limitation that may exist as provided under Article 8 above.

10.7  Conduct of Operations

      After  commencement  of  drilling  an  Exploratory  Well,  Operator  shall
      diligently conduct the operation without unreasonable delay until the well
      reaches  the  Objective  Depth,  unless the well  encounters,  at a lesser
      depth,  impenetrable  conditions or mechanical difficulties that cannot be
      overcome by  reasonable  and prudent  operations  and that render  further
      operations impracticable,  except as may otherwise be provided in optional
      provision Article 8.8 (Overexpenditures),  if selected. If a well does not
      reach its Objective Depth as a result of the conditions  mentioned in this
      Article  10.7,  the operation  shall be deemed to have been  completed and
      Article 13 (Non-consent  Operations) shall apply to each Non-participating
      Party for the portion of the well drilled.

10.8  Course of Action After Reaching Objective Depth

      When an  Exploratory  Well has been  drilled  to its  Objective  Depth and
      reasonable  testing,  coring, and logging have been completed as set forth
      in  the  approved  AFE  and  the  results  have  been   furnished  to  the
      Participating Parties,  Operator shall notify the Participating Parties of
      Operator's  recommendation  for further  operations  in the well,  and the
      following provisions shall apply:

      10.8.1  Election by Participating Parties

              A  Participating  Party  shall have the right to  propose  another
              operation  by notifying  the Operator and the other  Participating
              Parties of its proposed  operation within  twenty-four (24) hours,
              exclusive of Saturdays,  Sundays, and federal holidays, of receipt
              of the Operator's notice.  The Participating  Parties shall notify
              Operator within  forty-eight  (48) hours,  exclusive of Saturdays,
              Sundays,  and  federal  holidays,  of  receipt  of the  Operator's
              proposal   whether  the   Participating   Parties   elect  to  (a)
              participate in a recommended operation,  or (b) not participate in
              a recommended operation.  Failure to respond shall be deemed to be
              an  election  not  to  participate  in  any  of  the   recommended
              operations.

      10.8.2  Priority of Operations

              If all  Participating  Parties  elect to  participate  in the same
              proposed operation,  Operator shall conduct the operation at their
              cost and risk.  If more than one (1)  operation is approved by one
              (1) or  more  Participating  Parties  having  a  combined  Working
              Interest  of fourteen  percent  (14%) or more,  then the  approved
              operation  with the lowest  number as  indicated  below shall take
              precedence:

              1.     Additional  Testing,  coring,  or logging.  (If conflicting
                     proposals are approved,  the proposal receiving the largest
                     percentage of Working Interest approval shall take


                                       29
<PAGE>

                     precedence,  and  in the event  of a tie between two (2) or
                     more  approved   proposals,  the  approved   proposal first
                     received by the Parties shall take precedence.)

              2.     Deepen within the Contract Area. (If conflicting  proposals
                     are approved,  the operation  proposed to the deepest depth
                     shall take precedence.  If proposals to deepen and complete
                     at Objective  Horizon are both  approved,  a vote by two or
                     more with  combined  voting  interest of fifty-one  percent
                     (51%) will  determine  whether  deepening or  completing at
                     objective depth will take priority.)

              3.     Complete at the Objective Horizon.

              4.     Complete  above  the  Objective  Horizon.  (If  conflicting
                     proposals  are  approved,  the  operation  proposed  at the
                     deepest depth shall take precedence.)

              5.     Sidetrack.  (If  conflicting  proposals are  approved,  the
                     proposal  receiving the largest percentage Working Interest
                     approval shall take  precedence,  and in the event of a tie
                     between two (2) or more  approved  proposals,  the approved
                     proposal   first   received  by  the  Parties   shall  take
                     precedence.)

              6.     Other operations:  (If conflicting  proposals are approved,
                     the  proposal  receiving  the  largest  percentage  Working
                     Interest  approval shall take precedence,  and in the event
                     of a tie between two (2) or more  approved  proposals,  the
                     approved  proposal first received by the Parties shall take
                     precedence.)

              7.     Temporarily abandon.

              8.     Plug and abandon.

      10.8.3  Second Opportunity to Participate

              If fewer than all but one (1) or more Participating Parties having
              a combined  Working  Interest  of fourteen  percent  (14%) or more
              elect to  participate in an operation,  the proposing  Party shall
              notify the Participating  Parties of the elections made, whereupon
              a Party  originally  electing not to  participate  in the proposed
              operation may then elect to participate by notifying the proposing
              Party  within  forty-eight  (48) hours,  exclusive  of  Saturdays,
              Sundays,  and federal  holidays,  after receipt of such notice. If
              all  Parties  elect  to  participate  in the  proposed  operation,
              Operator shall conduct the operation at their cost and risk.

      10.8.4  Operations by Fewer Than All Parties

              If, after the election (if  applicable)  made under Article 10.8.3
              (Second Opportunity to Participate), fewer than all but one (1) or
              more  Parties  having a  combined  Working  Interest  of  fourteen
              percent  (14%)  or  more  elect  to  participate  in the  proposed
              operation that takes precedence,  the proposing Party shall notify
              the Participating  Parties and each Participating Party shall have
              forty-eight  (48) hours,  exclusive  of  Saturdays,  Sundays,  and
              federal  holidays,  after  receipt  of the  notice to  notify  the
              proposing Party of the portion of the costs and risks attributable
              to the total Non-participating Parties' interests It elects


                                       30
<PAGE>

              to pay and bear.  Unless  otherwise  agreed  by the  Participating
              Parties,  each Participating Party may, but shall not be obligated
              to, pay and bear that portion of the costs and risks  attributable
              to the total  Non-participating  Parties'  interests  in the ratio
              that  the  Participating  Party's  interest  bears  to  the  total
              interests of all Participating Parties who elect to pay and bear a
              portion of costs and risks  attributable to the  Non-participating
              Parties'  interests.  Failure to respond  shall be deemed to be an
              election not to pay or bear any additional  costs or risks. If the
              Participating  Parties agree to bear one hundred percent (100%) of
              the costs and risks of the operation, Operator, subject to Article
              4.2  (Substitute  Operator),  shall  conduct  the  operation  as a
              Non-consent   Operation  for  the  benefit  of  the  Participating
              Parties, and the provisions of Article 13 (Non-consent Operations)
              shall apply.  If such  agreement  is not  obtained,  however,  the
              operation shall not be conducted and the effect shall be as if the
              proposal  had not been made.  If a  Participating  Party in a well
              elects  not  to  participate  in  the  Deepening  or  Sidetracking
              operation in the well,  such  non-consenting  Party shall become a
              Non-participating   Party  In  all  operations  conducted  in  the
              Deepened or  Sidetracked  portion of the well after that election.
              If the Non-consent Operation is an Additional Testing,  coring, or
              logging operation,  Article 13 (Non-consent  Operations) shall not
              apply,  however,  a  Party  electing  not  to  participate  in the
              Additional  Testing,  coring,  or logging shall not be entitled to
              information resulting from the operation.

      10.8.5  Subsequent Operations

              Upon  completion  of an  operation  conducted  under  Article 10.8
              (Course of Action After Reaching  Objective Depth), if the well is
              not either (a) Completed as a Producible  Well, or (b) temporarily
              abandoned or  permanently  plugged and  abandoned,  Operator shall
              notify the Participating Parties of Operator's  recommendation for
              further  operations  in the well  under  Articles  10.8.1  through
              10.8.4,  which again shall apply.  If  sufficient  approval is not
              obtained  to conduct a  subsequent  operation  in a well or if all
              Participating  Parties elect to plug and abandon the well, subject
              to  Article  14   (Abandonment   and  Salvage),   Operator   shall
              permanently  plug and abandon the well at the cost and risk of all
              Participating   Parties.   Each   Participating   Party  shall  be
              responsible  for  its  proportionate  share  of the  plugging  and
              abandonment  costs  associated  with  the  operation  in  which it
              participated.

      10.8.6  Restoration of Damaged Well

              Notwithstanding  anything  to the  contrary in Article  19.7,  if,
              during Additional  Testing,  or during a Deepening or Sidetracking
              which does not result in the well being  Completed as a Producible
              Well,  the well is damaged to the extent that the well is rendered
              incapable of having a  lower-priority  operation  conducted  and a
              Party (a) who  participated  in the well, but not in the operation
              being  conducted  when  the  well  was  damaged,  (b)  who  has  a
              sufficient  percentage  of the  Working  Interest  to  approve  an
              operation,  and  (c)  who  elected  to  conduct  a  lower-priority
              operation  still desires to conduct the  lower-priority  operation
              after the well has been  damaged may  conduct  the  lower-priority
              operation, which would


                                       31
<PAGE>

              include  operations to either restore the well to a condition that
              will allow the  lower-priority  operation  to be  conducted  or to
              drill a new well to a sufficient depth to allow the lower-priority
              operation to be conducted.  Upon conclusion of the  lower-priority
              operation,  the  Participating  Parties  in  the  operation  being
              conducted   when  the  well  was  damaged   shall   reimburse  the
              Participating Parties conducting the lower-priority  operation all
              their costs  associated with  restoration of the well to the point
              prior  to the  lower-priority  operation  being  conducted.  In no
              event,  however,  shall the Participating Parties in the operation
              being conducted when the well was damaged be required to reimburse
              the Participating Parties conducting the lower-priority operations
              an amount  greater than what was actually  incurred in the damaged
              well.

10.9  Wells Proposed Below Deepest Producible Reservoir

      If a proposal is made to conduct an  Exploratory  Operation  involving the
      drilling of a well to an Objective  Horizon  below the base of the deepest
      Producible  Reservoir,  a Party may elect within the applicable  period to
      limit its  participation  in the operation down to the base of the deepest
      Producible  Reservoir.  For  purposes of this  Article  10.9,  a Party who
      elects to limit its participation in the operation down to the base of the
      deepest Producible Reservoir shall be referred to as "Shallow Participant"
      and a Party who elects to  participate  in the entire  operation  shall be
      referred  to as  "Deep  Participant".  If a  Party  elects  to  limit  its
      participation to the base of the deepest  Producible  Reservoir,  Operator
      shall  prepare and submit to the Shallow  Participant,  for  informational
      purposes,   a  separate  AFE  covering  operations  down  to  the  deepest
      Producible  Reservoir.  The Shallow  Participant  shall be a Participating
      Party in, and shall pay and bear the costs and risks of, each operation to
      the  base  of  the  deepest   Producible   Reservoir,   according  to  its
      Participating    Interest.    The   Shallow   Participant   shall   be   a
      Non-participating  Party in each  operation  below the deepest  Producible
      Reservoir,  and the operation shall be considered a Non-consent Operation,
      and the provisions of Article 13 (Non-consent  Operations) shall apply. If
      the well is Completed and produces  Hydrocarbons  from a horizon below the
      deepest  Producible  Reservoir,  the Deep Participant  shall reimburse the
      Shallow  Participant for its share of the actual well costs to the base of
      the deepest Producible Reservoir.  Payment shall be due within thirty days
      after  receipt of notice of the well  being  completed  below the  deepest
      Producible  Reservoir.  If the well is Completed and produces Hydrocarbons
      from a  horizon  below  the  deepest  Producible  Reservoir,  the  Shallow
      Participant  shall reimburse the Deep Participant for its Working Interest
      share of the  actual  well  costs to the  base of the  deepest  Producible
      Reservoir in accordance with Article 13.4 (Deepening or Sidetracking  Cost
      Adjustments),  upon the  earlier  of the time that (a) the well is plugged
      back to a horizon above the base of the deepest Producible  Reservoir,  as
      determined  when the original well was  proposed,  (b) the well is plugged
      and  abandoned,  or (c) the amount to be recouped by the Deep  Participant
      under Article 13 (Non-consent Operations) is recovered.

                             DEVELOPMENT OPERATIONS

11.1  Proposing Operations

      A Party may propose a Development  Operation in accordance  with Article 9
      (Notices)  to the  other  Parties  who  are  entitled  to  vote or make an
      election in regard to that operation.

11.2  Counterproposals

      When a Development  Operation is proposed, a Party may, within twenty (20)
      days after receipt of the AFE or notice for the original proposal,  make a
      counterproposal to conduct an alternative Development Operation by sending
      an AFE or notice to such Parties in  accordance  with Article 9 (Notices).
      The AFE or notice shall indicate that the proposal is a counterproposal to
      the original  proposal.  If one or more  counterproposals  are made,  such
      Parties shall elect to  participate in either the original  proposal,  one
      counterproposal,  or neither the original proposal nor a  counterproposal.
      If two or more proposals receive the approval of the number of Parties and
      combined Working  Interests  required by Article 11.5 (Operations By Fewer
      Than All Parties),  the proposal  receiving the largest percentage Working
      interest approval shall take precedence, and in the event of a tie between
      two (2) or more approved  proposals,  the approved proposal first received
      by the Parties shall prevail.  Except for the response  period provided in
      this Article  11.2, a  counterproposal  shall be subject to the same terms
      and conditions as the original proposal.

11.3  Operations by All Parties

      If all Parties elect to  participate in the proposed  operation,  Operator
      shall conduct the operation at their cost and risk.

11.4  Second Opportunity to Participate

      If there are more than two (2) Parties to this Agreement and if fewer than
      all but one (1) or more  Parties  having a combined  Working  Interest  of
      fourteen  percent (14%) or more elect to  participate,  then the proposing
      Party shall notify the Parties of the  elections  made,  whereupon a Party
      originally  electing not to  participate  may then elect to participate by
      notifying the proposing Party within forty-eight (48) hours,  exclusive of
      Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays, after receipt of such notice. If
      all Parties elect to participate in the proposed operation, Operator shall
      conduct the  operation  at their cost and risk.  If there are only two (2)
      Parties to this Agreement, then there shall not be a second opportunity to
      elect to  participate,  and if the  Participating  Party agrees to pay and
      bear one hundred  percent  (100%) of the costs and risks of the operation,
      then the Operator,  subject to Article 4.2  (Substitute  Operator),  shall
      conduct the  operation as a  Non-consent  Operation for the benefit of the
      Participating  Party,  and  the  provisions  of  Article  13  (Non-consent
      Operations) shall apply.

11.5  Operations by Fewer Than All Parties

      If there are more than two (2) Parties to this Agreement,  then, after the
      election  made under  Article 11.4 (Second  Opportunity  to  Participate),
      fewer  than  all but one (1) or more  Parties  having a  combined  Working
      Interest of fourteen  percent (14%) or more have elected to participate in
      the proposed operation, the proposing Party shall notify the Participating
      Parties,  and each Participating  Party shall have forty-eight (48) hours,
      exclusive of Saturdays,  Sundays,  and federal holidays,  after receipt of
      the notice to notify the  proposing  Party of the portion of the costs and
      risks  attributable to the total  Non-participating  Parties' interests it
      elects  to pay and bear.  Unless  otherwise  agreed  by the  Participating
      Parties,  each Participating Party may, but shall not be obligated to, pay
      and bear  that  portion  of costs  and  risks  attributable  to the  total
      Non-participating  Parties'  interests in the ratio that the Participating
      Party's interest bears to the total interests of all Participating Parties
      who elect to pay and bear a portion of the costs and risks attributable to
      the total Non-participating  Parties' interests.  Failure to respond shall
      be deemed to be an  election  not to pay or bear any  additional  costs or
      risks.  If the  Participating  Parties  agree to pay and bear one  hundred
      percent (100%) of the costs and risks of the operation.  Operator, subject
      to Article 4.2  (Substitute  Operator)  shall  conduct the  operation as a
      Non-consent  Operation for the benefit of the Participating  Parties,  and
      the provisions of Article 13 (Non-consent Operations) shall apply. If such
      agreement is not obtained,  however,  the operation shall not be conducted
      and the effect shall be as if the proposal had not been made.

11.6  Expenditures Approved

      Approval of a Development Operation shall cover all necessary expenditures
      associated  with the  operation  proposed  in the AFE or  notice  that are
      incurred by Operator in connection with (a) preparations for drilling; (b)
      the  actual  drilling;  (c)  evaluations,  such as  testing,  coring,  and
      logging; and (d) plugging and abandonment,  subject to any limitation that
      may exist as provided under Article 8 above.

11.7  Conduct of Operations

      After  commencement  of a  Development  Well,  Operator  shall  diligently
      conduct the operation  without  unreasonable  delay until the well reaches
      the  Objective  Depth,  unless  the well  encounters,  at a lesser  depth,
      impenetrable conditions or mechanical difficulties that cannot be overcome
      by  reasonable  and  prudent  operations  and  render  further  operations
      impracticable,  except as may otherwise be provided in optional  provision
      Article 8.8  (Overexpenditures),  if elected. If a well does not reach its
      Objective  Depth as a result of the  conditions  mentioned in this Article
      11.7, the operation  shall be deemed to have been completed and Article 13
      (Non-consent  Operations) shall apply to each Non-participating  Party for
      the portion of the well drilled.

11.8  Course of Action After Reaching Objective Depth

      When a  Development  Well has been  drilled  to its  Objective  Depth  and
      reasonable  testing,  coring,  and  logging  have been  completed  and the
      results have been furnished to the Participating Parties,


                                       34

      Operator   shall   notify  the   Participating   Parties   of   Operator's
      recommendation  for  further  operations  in the  well  and the  following
      provisions shall apply:

      11.8.1  Election by Fewer Than All Parties

              A  Participating  Party  shall have the right to  propose  another
              operation  by notifying  the Operator and the other  Participating
              Parties of its proposed  operation within  twenty-four (24) hours,
              exclusive of Saturdays,  Sundays, and federal holidays, of receipt
              of the Operator's notice.  The Participating  Parties shall notify
              Operator within  forty-eight  (48) hours,  exclusive of Saturdays,
              Sundays,  and  federal  holidays,  of  receipt  of the  Operator's
              proposal   whether  the   Participating   Parties   elect  to  (a)
              participate in a recommended operation,  or (b) not participate in
              a recommended operation.  Failure to respond shall be deemed to be
              an  election  not  to  participate  in  any  of  the   recommended
              operations.

      11.8.2  Priority of Operations

              If all  Participating  Parties  elect to  participate  in the same
              proposed operation,  Operator shall conduct the operation at their
              cost and risk.  If more than one (1)  operation is approved by one
              (1) or  more  Participating  Parties  having  a  combined  Working
              Interest  of fourteen  percent  (14%) or more,  then the  approved
              operation  with the lowest  number as  indicated  below shall take
              precedence:

              (Indicate the order of preference.)

              1.     Additional  Testing,  coring,  or logging.  (If conflicting
                     proposals are approved,  the proposal receiving the largest
                     percentage  of  Working   Interest   approval   shall  take
                     precedence,  and in the event of a tie  between  two (2) or
                     more  approved  proposals,   the  approved  proposal  first
                     received by the Parties shall take precedence.)

              2.     Complete at the Objective Horizon.

              3.     Complete  above  the  Objective  Horizon.  (If  conflicting
                     proposals  are  approved,  the  operation  proposed  to the
                     deepest/shallowest depth shall take precedence.)

              4.     Deepen the well to a new Objective Horizon. (If conflicting
                     proposals  are  approved,  the  operation  proposed  to the
                     deepest/shallowest depth shall take precedence.)

              5.     Sidetrack  the  well to  another  bottomhole  location  not
                     deeper than the  stratigraphic  equivalent  of the original
                     Objective  Depth.  (If conflicting  proposals are approved,
                     the proposal  receiving  the largest  percentage of Working
                     Interest  approval shall take precedence,  and in the event
                     of a tie between two (2) or more  approved  proposals,  the
                     approved  proposal first received by the Parties shall take
                     precedence.)

              6.     Other operations:  (If conflicting  proposals are approved,
                     the proposal  receiving  the largest  percentage of Working
                     Interest approval shall take precedence, and in


                                       35
<PAGE>

                     the  event  of a tie  between  two  (2)  or  more  approved
                     proposals,  the  approved  proposal  first  received by the
                     Parties shall take precedence.)

              7.     Temporarily abandon.

              8.     Plug and abandon.

      11.8.3  Second Opportunity to Participate

              If fewer than all but one (1) or more Participating Parties having
              a combined  Working  Interest  of fourteen  percent  (14%) or more
              elect to  participate in an operation,  the proposing  Party shall
              notify the Participating  Parties of the elections made, whereupon
              a Party  originally  electing not to  participate  in the proposed
              operation may then elect to participate by notifying the proposing
              Party  within  forty-eight  (48) hours,  exclusive  of  Saturdays,
              Sundays,  and federal  holidays,  after receipt of such notice. If
              all  Parties  elect  to  participate  in the  proposed  operation,
              Operator shall conduct the operation at their cost and risk.

      11.8.4  Operations by Fewer Than All Parties

              If, after the election (if  applicable)  made under Article 11.8.3
              (Second Opportunity to Participate), fewer than all but one (1) or
              more  Parties  having a  combined  Working  Interest  of  fourteen
              percent  (14%)  or  more  elect  to  participate  in the  proposed
              operation that takes precedence,  the proposing Party shall notify
              the Participating  Parties and each Participating Party shall have
              forty-eight  (48) hours,  exclusive  of  Saturdays,  Sundays,  and
              federal  holidays,  after  receipt  of the  notice to  notify  the
              proposing Party of the portion of the costs and risks attributable
              to the total Non-participating Parties' interests it elects to pay
              and bear.  Unless otherwise agreed by the  Participating  Parties,
              each  Participating  Party may, but shall not be obligated to, pay
              and bear that portion of the costs and risks  attributable  to the
              total  Non-participating  Parties' interests in the ratio that the
              Participating Party's interest bears to the total interests of all
              Participating Parties who elect to pay and bear a portion of costs
              and  risks   attributable   to  the   Non-participating   Parties'
              interests.  Failure to respond  shall be deemed to be an  election
              not  to  pay  or  bear  any  additional  costs  or  risks.  If the
              Participating  Parties  agree to pay and bear one hundred  percent
              (100%) of the costs and risks of the operation.  Operator, subject
              to Article 4.2 (Substitute Operator),  shall conduct the operation
              as a Non-consent  Operation  for the benefit of the  Participating
              Parties, and the provisions of Article 13 (Non-consent Operations)
              shall apply.  If such  agreement  is not  obtained,  however,  the
              operation shall not be conducted and the effect shall be as if the
              proposal  had not been made.  If a  Participating  Party in a well
              elects  not  to  participate  in  the  Deepening  or  Sidetracking
              operation in the well,  such  non-consenting  Party shall become a
              Non-participating   Party  in  all  operations  conducted  in  the
              Deepened or Sidetracked portion of the well after that election.


                                       36
<PAGE>

              If the Non-consent  Operation is an Additional  Testing operation,
              Article 13 (Non-consent  Operations) shall not apply,  however,  a
              Party electing not to participate in the Additional  Testing shall
              not be entitled to information resulting from the operation.

      11.8.5  Subsequent Operations

              Upon the completion of an operation  conducted  under Article 11.8
              (Course of Action After Reaching  Objective Depth), if the well is
              not  either  (a)   Completed   as  a  well  capable  of  producing
              Hydrocarbons in paying quantities, or (b) temporarily abandoned or
              permanently  plugged  and  abandoned,  Operator  shall  notify the
              Participating Parties of Operator's  recommendation for operations
              in the well under  Articles  11.8.1  through  11.8.4,  which again
              shall apply.  If sufficient  approval is not obtained to conduct a
              subsequent  operation in a well, or if all  Participating  Parties
              elect  to plug  and  abandon  the  well,  subject  to  Article  14
              (Abandonment,  Salvage,  and Surplus),  Operator shall permanently
              plug and  abandon  the well at the  expense  of all  Participating
              Parties.  Each  Participating  Party shall be responsible  for its
              proportionate   share  of  the  plugging  and  abandonment   costs
              associated with the operation in which it participated.

      11.8.6  Restoration of Damaged Well

              Notwithstanding  anything  to the  contrary in Article  19.7,  if,
              during Additional  Testing,  or during a Deepening or Sidetracking
              operation  which does not result in the well being  Completed as a
              Producible  Well,  the well is damaged to the extent that the well
              is  rendered  incapable  of  having  a  lower-priority   operation
              conducted and a Party (a) who participated in the well, but not in
              the operation being  conducted when the well was damaged,  (b) who
              has a sufficient  percentage of the Working Interest to approve an
              operation,  and  (c)  who  elected  to  conduct  a  lower-priority
              operation,  still desires to conduct the lower-priority  operation
              after the well has been  damaged,  may conduct the  lower-priority
              operation,  which would include  operations to either  restore the
              well to a condition that will allow the  lower-priority  operation
              to be conducted  or to drill a new well to a  sufficient  depth to
              allow  the   lower-priority   operation  to  be  conducted.   Upon
              conclusion  of the  lower-priority  operation,  the  Participating
              Parties in the operation being conducted when the well was damaged
              shall   reimburse  the   Participating   Parties   conducting  the
              lower-priority   operation   all  their  costs   associated   with
              restoration  of the well to the point prior to the  lower-priority
              operation   being   conducted.   In  no  event,   however,   shall
              Participating  Parties in the operation  being  conducted when the
              well was  damaged  be  required  to  reimburse  the  Participating
              Parties conducting the lower-priority operations an amount greater
              than what was actually incurred in the damaged well.

                      PLATFORM AND DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES

12.1  Proposal

      A Party may propose the fabrication or acquisition  and  installation of a
      Platform and/or Development Facilities, by sending an AFE or notice to the
      other Parties in accordance with Article 9 (Notices).

12.2  Counterproposals

      When a Platform  and/or  Development  Facilities is proposed under Article
      12.1,  a Party may,  within  thirty (30) days after  receipt of the AFE or
      notice for the original  proposal,  make a counterproposal to fabricate or
      otherwise acquire and install said Platform and/or Development  Facilities
      by  sending  an AFE or notice  to the other  Parties  in  accordance  with
      Article 9 (Notices). The AFE or notice shall indicate that the proposal is
      a   counterproposal   to  the   original   proposal.   If   one  or   more
      counterproposals are made, each Party shall elect to participate in either
      the  original  proposal,  one  counterproposal,  or neither  the  original
      proposal  nor a  counterproposal.  If two or more  proposals  receive  the
      approval of the number of Parties and combined Working Interests  required
      by Article  12.2.3  (Operations  By Fewer Than All Parties),  the proposal
      receiving the largest percentage Working Interest approval shall be deemed
      approved,  and in the event two (2) or more approved proposals receive the
      same Working Interest  approval,  the approved  proposal first received by
      the Parties shall be deemed approved.

      12.2.1  Operations by All Parties

              If all Parties  elect to  participate  in the proposed  operation,
              Operator shall conduct the operation at their cost and risk.

      12.2.2  Second Opportunity to Participate

              If there are more than two (2)  Parties  and if fewer than all but
              one (1) or more  Parties  having a combined  Working  Interest  of
              fourteen  percent  (14%)  or  more  elect  to  participate  in the
              Platform and/or Development  Facilities,  then the proposing Party
              shall notify the Parties of the elections made,  whereupon a Party
              originally   electing  not  to  participate   may  then  elect  to
              participate  by notifying the proposing  Party within  forty-eight
              (48) hours, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays,
              after receipt of such notice.  If all Parties elect to participate
              in the Platform  and/or  Development  Facilities,  Operator  shall
              timely commence the  fabrication and  installation of the Platform
              and/or Development Facilities at their cost and risk. If there are
              only two (2) Parties to this Agreement,  then there shall not be a
              second   opportunity   to  elect  to   participate,   and  if  the
              Participating  Party  agrees to pay and bear one  hundred  percent
              (100%) of the costs and risks of the operation, then the Operator,
              subject to Article 4.2 (Substitute Operator), shall


                                       38
<PAGE>

              conduct the operation as a  Non-consent  Operation for the benefit
              of the  Participating  Party,  and the  provisions  of  Article 13
              (Non-consent Operations) shall apply.

      12.2.3  Operations by Fewer Than All Parties

              If there are more than two (2)  Parties to this  Agreement,  then,
              after the election made under Article 12.2.2  (Second  Opportunity
              to Participate), fewer than all but one (1) or more Parties having
              a combined  Working  Interest  of fourteen  percent  (14%) or more
              elect  to   participate   in  the  Platform   and/or   Development
              Facilities,  the  proposing  Party shall notify the  Participating
              Parties,  and each Participating Party shall have forty-eight (48)
              hours,  exclusive of  Saturdays,  Sundays,  and federal  holidays,
              after receipt of the notice to notify the  proposing  Party of the
              portion  of  the  costs  and  risks   attributable  to  the  total
              Non-participating  Parties'  interests  it elects to pay and bear.
              Unless  otherwise  agreed  by  the  Participating   Parties,  each
              Participating  Party may, but shall not be  obligated  to, pay and
              bear that  portion  of costs and risks  attributable  to the total
              Non-participating   Parties'  interests  in  the  ratio  that  the
              Participating Party's interest bears to the total interests of all
              Participating  Parties  who elect to pay and bear a portion of the
              costs  and  risks  attributable  to  the  total  Non-participating
              Parties'  interests.  Failure to respond  shall be deemed to be an
              election not to pay or bear any additional  costs or risks. If the
              Participating  Parties  agree to pay and bear one hundred  percent
              (100%)  of the costs and  risks of the  operation,  the  Operator,
              subject to Article 4.2  (Substitute  Operator),  shall conduct the
              operation  as a  Non-consent  Operation  for  the  benefit  of the
              Participating  Parties,  and except as  provided  in Article  12.4
              (Rights to Take in Kind),  the  provisions  of Article  13.2.1.(b)
              shall apply.  If such  agreement  is not  obtained,  however,  the
              fabrication and  installation  of the Platform and/or  Development
              Facilities  shall not be commenced,  and the effect shall be as if
              the proposal had not been made.

12.3  Ownership and Use of the Platform and Development Facilities

      The  Participating  Parties in the  Development  Facilities own all of the
      excess capacity of the Development Facilities and the excess weight, space
      and buoyancy of the Platform.  Each Participating Party in the Development
      Facilities does not have the right to use its Participating Interest share
      of the  excess  capacity,  weight,  space  and  buoyancy  for  hydrocarbon
      production from outside the Contract Area. Each Participating Party in the
      Development  Facilities or Platform must obtain the unanimous  approval of
      the other Participating Parties in the Development  Facilities or Platform
      in order to utilize any portion of the excess capacity,  weight, space and
      buoyancy.  It must  negotiate the payment of a fee with the  Participating
      Parties in the Development  Facilities or Platform in order to utilize any
      portion of the excess capacity,  weight,  space and buoyancy.  Each of the
      Participating  Parties in the  Development  Facilities  or Platform  shall
      receive its  Participating  Interest  share of all fees  derived  from the
      utilization  of the  excess  capacity,  weight,  space and  buoyancy.  All
      hydrocarbon production from outside the Contract Area


                                       39
<PAGE>

      shall  be  processed  under  a  "Facilities  Use and  Production  Handling
      Agreement"  unanimously  agreed  to by the  Participating  Parties  in the
      Development Facilities.

12.4  Rights to Take in Kind

      Nothing  in this  Article  12 shall  act to limit a Party's  rights  under
      Article 22 (Disposition of Production), or to otherwise separately dispose
      of its  share of  Hydrocarbon  production.  If a Party  elects  (a) not to
      participate  in an approved  Development  Facilities  proposal  and (b) to
      separately dispose of its share of Hydrocarbon production (the "Separately
      Disposing Party"),  the Separately Disposing Party shall not be subject to
      the  provisions  of  Article  13.2.1.(b),  but must  provide  proof to the
      Participating  Parties in the approved  Development  Facilities  proposal,
      within  thirty  (30) days from the last  applicable  response  date to the
      Development  Facilities  proposal that it has entered into fabrication and
      transportation  contracts  to  separately  dispose  of its  own  share  of
      Hydrocarbon  production.  If a Separately Disposing Party fails to provide
      such proof by that  deadline and if there is  sufficient  capacity for the
      Development  Facilities to accommodate  the Separately  Disposing  Party's
      share of the Hydrocarbons, it shall immediately (I) become a Participating
      Party in the Development Facilities and utilize the Development Facilities
      for its share of  Hydrocarbon  production,  (II) pay to the  Participating
      Parties in the approved Development Facilities proposal an amount equal to
      two  hundred  percent  (200%)  of what  would  have  been  the  Separately
      Disposing  Party's  share of the  costs  and  expense  of the  Development
      Facilities  had it elected to participate  in the  Development  Facilities
      under  Article  12.1 or 12.2,  and (III) assume its share of the risks and
      liabilities   associated  with  the  construction  and  ownership  of  the
      Development Facilities as of the date of commencement of the operations to
      construct  same.  The  Participating  Parties in the original  Development
      Facilities  and  the   Separately   Disposing   Party,   which  becomes  a
      Participating Party in the original  Development  Facilities under Article
      12.4 (i),  shall own the original  Development  Facilities  based on their
      Participating Interest share in the original Development Facilities.  If a
      Separately  Disposing  Party fails to provide such proof by that  deadline
      and if there is insufficient  capacity for the  Development  Facilities to
      accommodate the Separately  Disposing  Party's share of the  Hydrocarbons,
      the Separately  Disposing Party shall (i) become a Participating  Party in
      the original Development  Facilities and utilize the available capacity in
      the original Development Facilities,  if any, for its share of Hydrocarbon
      production,  (ii)  pay one  hundred  percent  (100%)  of the  costs  of an
      expansion or modification of the Development Facilities, which is required
      to  accommodate  all or a portion  of its share of the  Hydrocarbons,  and
      assume one hundred percent (100%) of the risks and liabilities  associated
      with (A) the construction,  installation and commissioning of the expanded
      or modified Development Facilities and (B) the utilization of the expanded
      or  modified  Development  Facilities  for one hundred  eighty  (180) days
      subsequent to the  commencement  of Hydrocarbon  production  through same,
      (iii)  pay to  the  Participating  Parties  in  the  approved  Development
      Facilities  proposal an amount equal to two hundred percent (200%) of what
      would have been the  Separately  Disposing  Party's share of the costs and
      expense  of  the  original  Development   Facilities  had  it  elected  to
      participate in the

      original  Development  Facilities  under Article 12.1 or 12.2, (iv) assume
      its share of the risks and liabilities  associated  with the  construction
      and  ownership of the original  Development  Facilities  as of the date of
      commencement  of the  operations  to construct  the  original  Development
      Facilities.   The  Participating   Parties  in  the  original  Development
      Facilities  and  the   Separately   Disposing   Party,   which  becomes  a
      Participating Party in the original  Development  Facilities under Article
      12.4(i),  shall own the expanded or modified Development  Facilities based
      on  their  Participating   Interest  share  in  the  original  Development
      Facilities,  and the  Participating  Parties in the  original  Development
      Facilities  shall assume their  Participating  Interest share of the risks
      and liabilities  associated with the ownership of the expanded or modified
      Development  Facilities  one  hundred  eighty  (180)  days  after that the
      expanded or modified Development Facilities have been utilized.

12.5  Expansion or Modification of a Platform and/or Development Facilities

      After  installation  of a  Platform  and/or  Development  Facilities,  any
      Participating  Party in that Platform  and/or  Development  Facilities may
      propose the expansion or modification of that Platform and/or  Development
      Facilities by written notice (along with its associated  AFE) to the other
      Participating Parties in that Platform and/or Development Facilities. That
      proposal requires approval by two (2) or more of the Participating Parties
      in the Platform and/or Development Facilities with more than fifty percent
      (50%) of the  Participating  Interest in the Platform  and/or  Development
      Facilities.   If  approved,   that   proposal   will  be  binding  on  all
      Participating Parties in that Platform and/or Development Facilities,  and
      the Operator  shall commence that  expansion or  modification  at the sole
      cost and risk of all of the Participating  Parties in that Platform and/or
      Development Facilities unless otherwise agreed.

12.6  Offsite Host Facilities

      In the event that two (2) or more  Parties  with more than  fifty  percent
      (50%) of the Participating  Interest in Hydrocarbon  production agree that
      Hydrocarbon production can most effectively be processed and handled by an
      Offsite Host  Facilities,  the  Operator,  on behalf of the  Participating
      Parties,  shall use reasonable  efforts to secure a formal "Facilities Use
      and  Production  Handling  Agreement*  from the owners of the Offsite Host
      Facilities.  If the Operator does secure access to Offsite Host Facilities
      in a Facilities Use and Production Handling Agreement,  each Participating
      Party  shall  have the  right,  but not the  obligation,  to  utilize  its
      Participating Interest share of the capacity so secured. This Article 12.6
      shall  not  constitute  a limit  on a  Party's  right to  install  its own
      Take-in-Kind Facilities under Article 22 (Disposition of Production).

              quantities of Hydrocarbons  produced from it and the amount of the
              proceeds   from  the  sale  of  the   Non-participating   Parties'
              relinquished Hydrocarbon production from the Non-consent Operation
              for the preceding  quarter.  Operator  shall prepare the quarterly
              statement  of the  quantities  of  Hydrocarbons  produced  and the
              amounts  of  the  proceeds  from  the  sale  of  Non-participating
              Parties' relinquished Hydrocarbon production based on the proceeds
              received for the Operator's share of Hydrocarbon production.  When
              Operator's payout calculation  indicates that payout has occurred,
              Operator  shall  promptly  notify all Parties.  The  Participating
              Parties  who assumed a portion of the  Non-participating  Parties'
              relinquished  interest shall then provide Operator all information
              pertaining to the  cumulative  proceeds  received from the sale of
              the   Non-participating    Parties'    relinquished    Hydrocarbon
              production. Operator shall revise the payout date using the actual
              proceeds   from  the  sale  of  the   Non-participating   Parties'
              relinquished  Hydrocarbon production and administer any subsequent
              adjustments between the Parties.

      13.1.6  Completions

              For  determinations  under Article 13.1 (Non-consent  Operations),
              each Non-consent Operation in a single wellbore shall be accounted
              for separately.

13.2  Relinquishment of Interest

      Upon  commencement  of  Non-consent  Operations,  other  than  Non-consent
      Operations  governed by Article 13.7  (Operations  Utilizing a Non-consent
      Platform and/or Development  Facilities),  each Non-participating  Party's
      interest and leasehold  operating rights in the Non-consent  Operation and
      title to Hydrocarbon  production resulting therefrom;  and if Article 13.8
      (Discovery or Extension from Non-consent Drilling) is effective,  one-half
      (1/2) of each  Non-participating  Party's interest and leasehold operating
      rights and title to Hydrocarbon production from wells mentioned in Article
      13.8 (Discovery or Extension from Non-consent Drilling); shall be owned by
      and vested in each Participating  Party in proportion to its Participating
      Interest,  or in the  proportions  otherwise  agreed by the  Participating
      Parties,  for as long as the  Non-Consent  Operation is being conducted or
      Hydrocarbon production is obtained therefrom, subject to the following:

      13.2.1  Production Reversion Recoupment

              When the  Participating  Parties have recouped out of  Hydrocarbon
              production  from the  Non-consent  Operations  attributable to the
              Non-participating  Party's interest an amount, which when added to
              amounts  received under Article 13.3 (Deepening or Sidetracking of
              Non-consent Well), equals the sum of the following:

              (a)    Eight  hundred  percent  (800%)  of  the  Non-participating
                     Party's  share of the  costs of the  following  Non-consent
                     Exploratory  Operations,  or six hundred  percent (600%) of
                     the  Non-participating  Party's  share of the  costs of the
                     following  Non-consent  Development  Operations:  drilling,
                     testing, Completing, Recompleting,


                                       43

                     Deepening,  Sidetracking,  Reworking,  plugging  back,  and
                     temporarily    abandoning   a   well,    reduced   by   the
                     Non-participating  Party's  Share  of a  cash  contribution
                     received under Article 21.2 (Cash Contributions);

              (b)    if   applicable,    three   hundred   percent   (300%)   of
                     Non-participating  Party's  Share of the cost of  Platforms
                     and/or Development  Facilities  approved under Article 12.1
                     (Proposal)   or  Article  12.2   (Counterproposals);   such
                     recoupment  is  limited  to the  Non-participating  Party's
                     Share  of the  Hydrocarbon  production  that  utilize  such
                     Platform and/or Development Facilities;

              (c)    Three  hundred  percent  (300%)  of  the  Non-participating
                     Party's  Share  of the  cost  charged  in  accordance  with
                     Article 13.9 (Allocation of Platform/Development Facilities
                     Costs to  Non-consent  Operations)  of  using  an  existing
                     Platform/Development Facilities; and

              (d)    the  Non-participating   Party's  Share  of  the  costs  of
                     operation,  maintenance,  treating, processing,  gathering,
                     and  transportation,  including,  but not  limited  to,  an
                     Offsite Host Facilities' handling fees, as well as lessor's
                     royalties and severance, Hydrocarbon production, and excise
                     taxes,   then,   the   relinquished    interests   of   the
                     Non-participating  Party shall automatically  revert to the
                     Non-participating  Party as of 7:00  a.m.  of the day after
                     the recoupment occurs.  Thereafter,  the Non- participating
                     Party shall own the same interest in the Non-consent  Well,
                     equipment  pertaining thereto,  including,  but not limited
                     to,  any  Platform  or  Development  Facilities,   and  the
                     Hydrocarbon  production therefrom as the Non- participating
                     Party  would  have  owned  or  been  entitled  to if it had
                     participated in the Non-consent Operation.  Upon reversion,
                     the  Non-participating  Party shall become a  Participating
                     Party  and,   as  such,   shall   become   liable  for  its
                     proportionate  share of the further  costs of the operation
                     as set forth in this Agreement and Exhibit "C".

      13.2.2  Non-production Reversion

              If  the  Non-consent   Operation   fails  to  obtain   Hydrocarbon
              production or if the operation  results in Hydrocarbon  production
              that  ceases  before  complete  recoupment  by  the  Participating
              Parties under Article 13.2.1  (Production  Reversion  Recoupment),
              such   leasehold   operating   rights   shall   revert   to   each
              Non-participating   Party,  except  that  all  Non-consent  Wells,
              Platforms,  and Development  Facilities shall remain vested in the
              Participating  Parties (but the salvage value in excess of the sum
              remaining under Article 13.2.1 shall be credited to all Parties).

13.3  Deepening or Sidetracking of Non-consent Well

      If a  Participating  Party  proposes to Deepen or Sidetrack a  Non-consent
      Well,  a  Non-participating  Party may then  elect to  participate  in the
      Deepening or  Sidetracking  operation by notifying  Operator within thirty
      (30) days,  or within  forty-eight  (48) hours,  exclusive  of  Saturdays,
      Sundays,


                                       44
<PAGE>

      and  federal  holidays,  if a rig is on location  and standby  charges are
      being   incurred,    after   receiving   notice   of   the   proposal.   A
      Non-participating  Party  that  elects  to  participate  in  Deepening  or
      Sidetracking   the  well,   as  proposed,   shall   immediately   pay  the
      Participating  Parties,  in  accordance  with Article 13.4  (Deepening  or
      Sidetracking Cost Adjustments),  its Working Interest share of actual well
      costs (excluding logging, coring, testing, and Completion costs other than
      the cost of setting any casing or Completion Equipment that is used in the
      Deepening   or   Sidetracking),   less  all  amounts   recovered   by  the
      Participating Parties from the proceeds of Hydrocarbon production from the
      well, as if the Non-participating Party had originally participated to the
      initial  objective  depth  or  formation,  in  the  case  of  a  Deepening
      operation,  or the depth at which the Sidetracking operation is initiated.
      Thereafter,   the  Non-participating   Party  shall  be  deemed  to  be  a
      Participating  Party for the  Deepening or  Sidetracking  operations,  and
      Article  13.2.1  (a)  shall not apply to that  Party for the  Deepened  or
      Sidetracked  portion  of the  well.  The  initial  Participating  Parties,
      however,  shall  continue  to recoup out of the  proceeds  of  Hydrocarbon
      production  from the  non-consent  portion of the well any balance for the
      Non-consent   Well   remaining  to  be  recovered   under  Article  13.2.1
      (Production   Reversion   Recoupment),   less  the  amounts  paid  by  the
      Non-participating Party under this Article 13.3.

13.4  Deepening or Sidetracking Cost Adjustments

      If a proposal is made to Deepen or  Sidetrack a  Non-consent  Well, a well
      cost adjustment will be performed as follows:

      (a)     Intangible  drilling will be valued at the actual cost incurred by
              the Participating Parties.

      (b)     Tangible   materials  will  be  valued  in  accordance   with  the
              provisions of Exhibit "C".

      (c)     For  Sidetracking  operations,  the values  determined in Articles
              13.4(a) and 13.4(b)  shall be reduced by the amount  allocated  to
              that  portion  of the well from the  surface to one  hundred  feet
              (100') below the point at which the  Sidetracking  was  initiated.
              Such   allocations   shall  be  consistent   with  the  guidelines
              recommended  by the  applicable  Council of Petroleum  Accountants
              Societies ("COPAS") Guideline, as amended from time to time.

      (d)     Amortization/depreciation  shall be applied to both intangible and
              tangible values at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum from
              the date the well  commenced  Hydrocarbon  production  to the date
              operations  commence to Deepen or  Sidetrack  the well,  provided,
              however,   the  value  of  tangible   materials   after   applying
              depreciation  shall never be less than fifty  percent (50%) of the
              value determined in Article 13.4(b).

13.5  Subsequent Operations in Non-consent Well

      Except  as  provided  in  Article  13.3   (Deepening  or  Sidetracking  of
      Non-consent  Well),  an  election  not to  participate  in  the  drilling,
      Sidetracking, or Deepening of a well shall be deemed to be an election not
      to  participate  in any  subsequent  operations  in the well  before  full
      recovery by the  Participating  Parties of the  Non-participating  Party's
      recoupment amount.

13.6  Operations in a Production Interval

      A  Participating  Party in a  Production  Interval  may propose  Rework or
      Sidetrack  operations within that Production  Interval,  or to permanently
      plug  and  abandon  that  Production  Interval  in  a  well;  however,  no
      Production  Interval in a well shall be  abandoned  without the  unanimous
      approval of the  Participating  Parties in the Production  interval,  if a
      proposal,  estimated to exceed the amount specified in Article 8.2 (AFEs),
      is  made  to  Rework  or   Sidetrack  a  Production   Interval,   and  the
      Participating  Parties  elect to  participate  in the proposed  operation,
      Operator shall conduct the operation at their sole cost and risk. If fewer
      than  all but two (2) or more  Parties  having  a  combined  Participating
      Interest of seventy-one  percent (71%) or more elect to participate in the
      proposed  operation,  Operator shall conduct the Reworking or Sidetracking
      operation  at the cost and risk of the  Participating  Parties  owning  an
      interest in the  Production  Interval.  A proposal to Rework an  interval,
      other than a Production Interval, shall be made and approved in accordance
      with Article 11.5 (Operations by Fewer Than All Parties).

13.7  Operations Utilizing a Non-consent Platform and/or Development Facilities

      Except as otherwise  provided in Article 12.4 (Rights to Take in Kind) and
      this  Article  13.7,  if  applicable,  a Party  that  did  not  originally
      participate  in  a  Platform  and/or  Development  Facilities  shall  be a
      Non-participating  Party for all operations  utilizing the Platform and/or
      Development   Facilities   and   shall  be   subject   to   Article   13.2
      (Relinquishment  of  Interest).  Notice,  in  accordance  with  Article  9
      (Notices),  shall be given to the  Non-participating  Party  for all wells
      proposed  to be drilled  from or  tied-back  to the  Non-consent  Platform
      and/or   handled   by   non-consent   Development    Facilities.    If   a
      Non-participating  Party  in a  Non-consent  Platform  and/or  Development
      Facilities  desires  to  participate  in the  drilling  of any  such  well
      proposed by the Participating  Parties in the Platform and/or  Development
      Facilities,  the Non-participating  Party desiring to join in the proposed
      well shall  first pay the  Participating  Parties in the  Platform  and/or
      Development Facilities its proportionate share of the cost of the Platform
      and/or  Development  Facilities,  including,  but not limited to, costs of
      material, fabrication, transportation, and installation plus any remaining
      amounts to be recouped  under  Article  13.2.1(b).  The  Non-participating
      Party shall remit payment to Operator and Operator shall (a) reimburse the
      Participating Parties in the Platform and/or Development Facilities in the
      same  proportions  they are sharing in the  Platforms  and/or  Development
      Facilities  recoupment  account,  and (b)  credit  the  applicable  payout
      account. Upon payment of that amount, the original Non-participating Party
      shall become an owner and a  Participating  Party in the  Platform  and/or
      Development  Facilities in the same manner as if  recoupment  had occurred
      under  Article  13.2.1   (Production   Reversion   Recoupment),   and  may
      participate in all future wells drilled from or tied back to the Platform.
      As to well  operations  conducted  from the  Platform  and/or  Development
      Facilities  prior  to  payment  under  this  Article  13.7,  the  original
      Non-participating  Party shall  remain a  Non-participating  Party in such
      Non-consent  Operations until such time as the entire  recoupment  balance
      applicable to all such Non-


                                       46

      consent  Operations  in the  aggregate  has  occurred,  as provided for in
      Articles 13.2.1 (a) and 13.2.1 (d).

13.8  Discovery or Extension from Non-consent Drilling

      If a  Non-consent  Well (a)  discovers a new  Producible  Reservoir or (b)
      extends an existing Producible Reservoir beyond its recognized boundaries,
      as unanimously  agreed by the Participating  Parties in all existing wells
      currently  producing  from  the  existing   Producible   Reservoir  before
      commencement of drilling operations,  the recoupment of costs for the well
      shall be governed by Article 13.2  (Relinquishment  of Interest) and shall
      be recovered by the Participating Parties in one of the following ways:

      (a)     if the Non-consent Well is not completed and produced,  recoupment
              shall be out of one- half (1/2) of each Non-participating  Party's
              interest in Hydrocarbon  production from all subsequently  drilled
              and completed wells on the Contract Area that are completed in the
              Producible Reservoir  discovered,  or in that portion extended, by
              the Non-consent Well and in which the Non-participating  Party has
              a Participating Interest; or

      (b)     if the  Non-consent  Well is completed  and  produced,  recoupment
              shall  be out of  the  Non-  participating  Party's  Share  of all
              Hydrocarbon  production  from the  Non-consent  Well and  one-half
              (1/2) of the  Non-participating  Party's  interest in  Hydrocarbon
              production  from all  subsequently  drilled and completed wells on
              the Contract Area that are completed in the  Producible  Reservoir
              discovered,  or in that portion extended,  by the Non-consent Well
              and in  which  the  Non-participating  Party  has a  Participating
              Interest.

13.9  Allocation of Platform/Development Facilities Costs to Non-consent
      Operations

      Non-consent Operations shall be subject to further conditions  as follows:

      13.9.1  Charges

              In the event a well is drilled or produced from a Platform  and/or
              is produced through  Development  Facilities  whose  Participating
              Parties are different from the Participating  Parties in that well
              or if the Participating  Parties' Participating Interest shares in
              that Platform  and/or  Development  Facilities  are different from
              their  Participating  Interest  shares in that well, the rights of
              the  Participating  Parties  in that well and the costs to use the
              Platform  and/or  Development  Facilities  for that well  shall be
              determined as follows:

              (a)    The  Participating  Parties  in that well  shall pay to the
                     Operator a one-time slot usage fee for the use of a slot on
                     the Platform  equal to two and one-half  percent  (2.5%) of
                     the cost of the Platform.  Within  fifteen (15) days of its
                     receipt of that fee, the Operator  shall  distribute to the
                     Participating  Parties in the Platform their  Participating
                     Interest share of that payment. For purposes of calculating
                     the slot usage fee, the total cost of the Platform shall be
                     reduced by 0.53333% per month,  commencing  on the date the
                     Platform  was   installed   and   continuing   every  month
                     thereafter  until the month actual  drilling  operations on
                     that well is


                                       47
<PAGE>

                     commenced;  however,  the total cost of the Platform  shall
                     not be  reduced  by more than  fifty  percent  (50%) of the
                     total  Platform's  costs.  The  cost  of  additions  to the
                     Platform shall be reduced in the same manner commencing the
                     first month after the addition is  installed.  If that well
                     is abandoned, having never produced Hydrocarbons, the right
                     of the  Participating  Parties  in  that  well  to use  the
                     Platform  slot  through  which the well was  drilled  shall
                     terminate   unless  those  Parties   commence   drilling  a
                     substitute  well for the  abandoned  well  through the same
                     slot within  ninety (90) days of the  abandonment.  If that
                     substitute   well  is  abandoned,   having  never  produced
                     Hydrocarbons,  the right of the  Participating  Parties  in
                     that well to use the Platform  slot through  which the well
                     was drilled shall  terminate.  The slot usage fee shall not
                     apply  to a slot  deemed  to be  "surplus."  A slot  may be
                     deemed  surplus  only  by the  unanimous  agreement  of the
                     Participating Parties in the Platform.

              (b)    The  Participating  Parties  in that well  shall pay to the
                     owners of the  Development  Facilities  a lump sum equal to
                     that  portion  of  the  total  cost  of  those  Development
                     Facilities  that the throughput  volume of the  Non-consent
                     Operation  bears to  current  the total  design  throughput
                     volume of the  Development  Facilities.  Throughput  volume
                     shall be estimated by the Operator in barrels  produced per
                     day (with 1 barrel of oil equaling  5.8 mcf of gas),  using
                     an  average  daily  volume  of the  first  three  months of
                     Hydrocarbon production from the Non-consent Operation.  For
                     purposes of calculating the Development Facilities lump sum
                     payment,  the  total  cost of the  Development  Facilities,
                     shall be reduced by 0.53333% per month, commencing from the
                     date when the  Development  Facilities  were  installed and
                     continuing  every  month  thereafter  until the first month
                     during which  Hydrocarbon  production  from the Non-consent
                     Operation commences,  but the total cost of the Development
                     Facilities  shall not be reduced  more than  fifty  percent
                     (50%)  of the  total  Development  Facilities'  cost.  If a
                     modification,  expansion,  or addition  to the  Development
                     Facilities  is  made  after  commencing  first  Hydrocarbon
                     production  and  before   connection  of  the   Non-consent
                     Operation to the  Development  Facilities,  the Development
                     Facilities  lump sum  payment  shall be reduced in the same
                     manner  described  above,  from  the  month  in  which  the
                     Development Facilities modification,  expansion or addition
                     Is completed until the first month during which Hydrocarbon
                     production from the Non-consent Operation Is commenced.

              Payment of sums under this Article  13.9.1 is not a purchase of an
              additional interest in the Platform or the Development Facilities.
              Such  payment  shall be  included  in the  total  amount  that the
              Participating  Parties are  entitled to recoup out of  Hydrocarbon
              production from the Non-consent Well.

      13.9.2  Operating and Maintenance Charges

              The Participating Parties shall pay all costs necessary to connect
              a Non-consent Well to the Platform and/or  Development  Facilities
              and  that  proportionate  part  of  the  costs  of  operating  and
              maintaining the Platform and/or Development  Facilities applicable
              to the Non-consent Well.  Platform operating and maintenance costs
              that are costs not directly  attributable  to a wellbore  shall be
              allocated equally to all actively producing Completions. Operating
              and  maintenance  costs for the  Development  Facilities  shall be
              allocated on a volume throughput basis, that is, in the proportion
              that the volume  throughput  of the well bears to the total volume
              throughput of all wells connected to the  Development  Facilities.
              Volume  throughput,  as used  in this  Article  13.9.2,  shall  be
              determined by considering all Hydrocarbons and water volumes.

13.10 Allocation of Costs Between Zones

      Except  as  provided  in  Article  10.9  (Wells   Proposed  Below  Deepest
      Producible  Reservoir),  if for any reason the Participating  Interests of
      the  Parties  in a well  are not the  same  for the  entire  depth  or the
      Completion thereof, the costs of drilling,  Completing,  and equipping the
      well shall be allocated in an equitable  manner, as agreed by the Parties,
      based on the value and  allocation  recommended  in the  applicable  COPAS
      Guideline, as amended from time to time.

13.11 Lease Maintenance Operations

      An  operation  proposed  within the last twelve (12) months of the primary
      term or, subsequent thereto, an operation proposed to perpetuate the Lease
      or portion thereof at its expiration date or otherwise, including, but not
      limited to, well  operations,  regulatory  relief (for example,  course of
      action  necessary to satisfy the statutory or regulatory  requirements  of
      the  governmental   authority  having   jurisdiction),   and  other  Lease
      operations,  shall be deemed  to be a "Lease  Maintenance  Operation."  To
      invoke this Article 13.11, a notice or AFE that proposes an operation must
      state that the proposed operation is a Lease Maintenance Operation.

      13.11.1 Participation in Lease Maintenance Operations

              A Party may propose a Lease Maintenance Operation by giving notice
              to  the  other  Parties.  If  fewer  than  all  Parties  elect  to
              participate  in the  proposed  Lease  Maintenance  Operation,  the
              proposing  Party shall notify the Parties of the  elections  made.
              Each Party  electing not to  participate  shall then have a second
              opportunity to participate in the proposed  operation by notifying
              the other Parties of its election  within  forty-eight  (48) hours
              after receipt of the notice. A Lease  Maintenance  Operation shall
              not require minimum  approval,  either of the number of Parties or
              the  percentage of the voting  interests of the Parties  otherwise
              required in Article 6.1.2 (Vote Required). For a Lease Maintenance
              Operation to be conducted, the Participating Parties must agree to
              pay and bear one hundred  percent (100%) of the costs and risks of
              the  operation.  If more than one Lease  Maintenance  Operation is
              proposed, the operation with the greatest


                                       49
<PAGE>

              percentage  approval  shall  be  conducted.   Notwithstanding  the
              recoupment  provisions of this Agreement,  a Party electing not to
              participate  in a well operation  proposed as a Lease  Maintenance
              Operation  shall  promptly  assign,  effective  as of the date the
              operation  commences,  to  the  Participating  Parties  all of its
              right,  title, and interest in and to that portion of the Contract
              Area that would  otherwise  expire and the property and  equipment
              attributable  thereto,  in accordance with Article 26 (Successors,
              Assigns,  [and  Preferential  Rights]).  If more  than  one  Lease
              Maintenance  Operation  is proposed and there is a tie between two
              proposed  operations,  both operations  shall be conducted and the
              costs and risks of conducting  both  operations  shall be paid and
              borne by the Participating  Parties.  If the drilling of a well is
              undertaken as a Lease Maintenance  Operation,  further  operations
              conducted  by the  Participating  Parties  in the  well  shall  be
              governed  by  Article  10.9  (Course  of  Action  After   Reaching
              Objective  Depth) or Article 11.9 (Course of Action After Reaching
              Objective  Depth),  whichever  applies.  If  more  than  one  well
              operation is conducted, any of which would perpetuate the Lease or
              such portion  thereof,  an assignment shall not be required from a
              Party participating in any such well operation.

      13.11.2 Accounting  for  Non-participation  If  after  one (1)  year  from
              completion of a well  operation  conducted as a Lease  Maintenance
              Operation,  the Lease or portion thereof is being perpetuated by a
              Lease  Maintenance  Operation,  as  provided  in  Article  13.11.1
              (Participation  in Lease Maintenance  Operations),  Operator shall
              render a final  statement,  if applicable,  to the assigning Party
              for its share of all expenses  attributed to the assigned interest
              before the effective  date of the  assignment,  plus any credit or
              deficiency in salvage value calculated under Article 15.3.1 (Prior
              Expenses).  The assigning  Party shall settle any deficiency  owed
              the non-assigning Parties within thirty (30) days after receipt of
              Operator's statement.

                                   ARTICLE 14

                       ABANDONMENT, SALVAGE, AND SURPLUS

14.1  Platform Salvage and Removal Costs

      When the Parties owning wells,  Platforms  and/or  Development  Facilities
      unanimously  agree to dispose of the wells,  Platforms and/or  Development
      Facilities,  it shall be  disposed  of by  Operator in the time and manner
      approved by the Parties.  The costs, risks, and net proceeds,  if any, for
      the  disposal  shall be  shared  by the  Parties  in  proportion  to their
      Participating Interests therein.

14.2  Abandonment of Platforms, Development Facilities or Wells

      Except as provided in Article 10  (Exploratory  Operations) and Article 11
      (Development   Operations),   a   Participating   Party  may  propose  the
      abandonment of a Platform and Development


                                       50
<PAGE>

      Facilities  or wells by  notifying  the other  Participating  Parties.  No
      Platform and Development Facilities or wellbore shall be abandoned without
      the unanimous approval of the Participating  Parties. If the Participating
      Parties do not approve abandoning the Platform and Development  Facilities
      or wells, the Operator shall prepare a statement of the abandoning Party's
      share of estimated  abandonment costs, less its share of estimated salvage
      value,  as determined  by the Operator  pursuant to Exhibit "C". The Party
      desiring  to  abandon  it  shall  pay  the  Operator,  on  behalf  of  the
      Participating  Parties for that Party's share of the estimated abandonment
      costs, less its share of estimated salvage value,  within thirty (30) days
      after  receipt  of the  Operator's  statement.  If an  abandoning  Party's
      respective share of the estimated  salvage value is greater than its share
      of the estimated costs,  Operator, on behalf of the Participating Parties,
      shall pay a sum equal to the  deficiency  to the  abandoning  Party within
      thirty (30) days after the  abandoning  Party's  receipt of the Operator's
      statement.

14.3  Assignment of Interest.

      Each  Participating  Party desiring to abandon a Platform and  Development
      Facilities  or  wells  under  Article  14.2   (Abandonment  of  Platforms,
      Development  Facilities or Wells) shall  assign,  effective as of the last
      applicable election date, to the non-abandoning  Parties, in proportion to
      their   Participating   Interests,   its  interest  in  the  Platform  and
      Development  Facilities  or  wells  and  the  equipment  therein  and  its
      ownership  in the  Hydrocarbon  production  from  the  wells.  A Party  so
      assigning  shall be relieved  from further  liability for the Platform and
      Development  Facilities  or wells,  except  liability  for payments  under
      Article 14.2 (Abandonment of Platforms, Development Facilities or Wells).

14.4  Abandonment Operations Required by Governmental Authority

      A well abandonment or Platform and Development Facilities removal required
      by a governmental  authority having  jurisdiction shall be accomplished by
      Operator with the costs, risks, and net proceeds,  if any, to be shared by
      the Parties  owning the well or Platform  and  Development  Facilities  in
      proportion to their  Participating  Interests therein.  No approval by the
      Parties  will be necessary  for  Operator to proceed  with the  government
      required well abandonment, or Platform and Development Facilities removal.
      The Operator shall provide the Parties with an informational  AFE prior to
      commencing such an abandonment or removal.

14.5  Disposal of Surplus Material

      Material and equipment  acquired hereunder may be classified as surplus by
      Operator  when  deemed  no  longer   needed  in  present  or   foreseeable
      operations.  Operator  shall  determine the value and cost of disposing of
      the  materials  in  accordance  with  Exhibit  "C".  If  the  material  is
      classified as junk or if the value, less cost of disposal, is less than or
      equal  to One  Hundred  Thousand  Dollars  ($100,000.00),  Operator  shall
      dispose of the surplus  materials in any manner it deems  appropriate.  If
      the value, less the cost of disposal of the surplus  material,  is greater
      than One  Hundred  Thousand  Dollars  ($100,000.00),  Operator  shall give
      written notice thereof to the


                                       51
<PAGE>

      Parties  owning the material.  Unless  purchased by Operator,  the surplus
      material  shall be disposed of in  accordance  with the method of disposal
      approved by the Parties  owning the  material.  Proceeds  from the sale or
      transfer of surplus  material shall be promptly  credited to each Party in
      proportion  to its  ownership of the material at the time of retirement or
      disposition.

                                   WITHDRAWAL

15.1  Right to Withdraw

      Subject to this Article 15.1,  any Party may withdraw from this  Agreement
      as to one or more Leases (the "Withdrawing Party") by giving prior written
      notice to all  other  Parties  stating  its  decision  to  withdraw  ("the
      withdrawal notice"). The withdrawal notice shall specify an effective date
      of withdrawal  that is at least sixty (60) days,  but not more than ninety
      (90) days,  after the date of the  withdrawal  notice.  Within thirty (30)
      days of receipt of the  withdrawal  notice,  the other Parties may join in
      the  withdrawal  by giving  written  notice  of that fact to the  Operator
      ("written  notice  to join in the  withdrawal")  and upon  giving  written
      notice to join in the  withdrawal  are "Other  Withdrawing  Parties".  The
      withdrawal  notice and the written  notice to join in the  withdrawal  are
      unconditional  and  irrevocable  offers by the  Withdrawing  Party and the
      Other Withdrawing  Parties to convey to the Parties who do not join in the
      withdrawal ("the Remaining Parties") the Withdrawing Party's and the Other
      Withdrawing  Parties'  entire  Working  Interest  in all of the  Lease  or
      Leases,  Hydrocarbon  production,  and other property and equipment  owned
      under this Agreement.

15.2  Response to Withdrawal Notice

      Failure to respond to a withdrawal notice is deemed a decision not to join
      in the withdrawal.

      15.2.1  Unanimous Withdrawal

              If all the other Parties join in the withdrawal,

              (a)    no assignment of Working Interests shall take place;

              (b)    subject  to Article  14.4,  no  further  operations  may be
                     conducted  under  this  Agreement  unless  agreed to by all
                     Parties;

              (c)    the Parties shall  abandon all  activities  and  operations
                     within  the  Contract  Area  and  relinquish  all of  their
                     Working Interests to the MMS within ninety (90) days of the
                     conclusion of the thirty (30) day joining period; and

              (d)    notwithstanding  anything  to the  contrary  in  Article 14
                     (Abandonment, Salvage and Surplus), the Operator shall:

<PAGE>

                     1)   furnish all Parties a detailed  abandonment  plan,  if
                          applicable,  and a  detailed  cost  estimate  for  the
                          abandonment   within   thirty   (30)  days  after  the
                          conclusion of the thirty (30) day joining period; and

                     2)   cease  operations  and begin to  permanently  plug and
                          abandon  all  wells  and  remove  all   Facilities  in
                          accordance with the abandonment plan.

      15.2.2  No Additional Withdrawing Parties

              If none of the  other  Parties  join in the  withdrawal,  then the
              Remaining Parties must accept an assignment of their Participating
              Interest share of the Withdrawing Party's Working Interest.

      15.2.3  Acceptance of the Withdrawing Parties' Interests.

              If one or  more  but  not  all of the  other  Parties  join in the
              withdrawal  and become  Other  Withdrawing  Parties,  then  within
              forty-eight  (48) hours  (exclusive  of  Saturdays,  Sundays,  and
              federal holidays) of the conclusion of the thirty (30) day joining
              period, each of the Remaining Parties shall submit to the Operator
              a written  rejection or acceptance of its  Participating  Interest
              share of the Withdrawing  Party's and Other  Withdrawing  Parties'
              Working  Interest.  Failure  to make  that  written  rejection  or
              acceptance shall be deemed a written acceptance.  If the Remaining
              Parties are unable to select a successor Operator,  if applicable,
              or if a Remaining Party submits a written  rejection and the other
              Remaining  Parties  do not agree to  accept  one  hundred  percent
              (100%) of the Withdrawing  Party's and Other Withdrawing  Parties'
              Working  Interest within thirty (30) days of the conclusion of the
              forty-eight  (48) hour  period to  submit a written  rejection  or
              acceptance, the Remaining Parties will be deemed to have joined in
              the withdrawal,  and Article 15.2.1  (Unanimous  Withdrawal)  will
              apply.

      15.2.4  Effects of Withdrawal

              Except as  otherwise  provided in this  Agreement,  after giving a
              withdrawal  notice or a written notice to join in the  withdrawal,
              the  Withdrawing  Party  and  Other  Withdrawing  Parties  are not
              entitled to approve or participate in any activity or operation in
              the Contract Area,  other than those  activities or operations for
              which they  retain a  financial  responsibility.  The  Withdrawing
              Party and Other Withdrawing Parties shall take all necessary steps
              to accomplish  their  withdrawal by the effective date referred to
              in Article 15.1 (Right to Withdraw)  and shall execute and deliver
              to the Remaining Parties all necessary instruments to assign their
              Working Interest to the Remaining Parties. A Withdrawing Party and
              Other Withdrawing  Parties shall bear all expenses associated with
              their withdrawal and the transfer of their Working Interest.

15.3  Limitation Upon and Conditions of Withdrawal

      15.3.1  Prior Expenses

              The Withdrawing Party and Other Withdrawing  Parties remain liable
              for  their  Participating  Interest  share  of  the  costs  of all
              activities,   operations,   rentals,  royalties,  taxes,  damages,
              Hydrocarbon imbalances,  or other liability or expense accruing or
              relating to (i)  obligations  existing as of the effective date of
              the  withdrawal,  (ii) operations  conducted  before the effective
              date  of  the  withdrawal,   (iii)  operations   approved  by  the
              Withdrawing  Party  and  Other  Withdrawing   Parties  before  the
              effective date of the withdrawal,  or (iv) operations commenced by
              the  Operator  under one of its  discretionary  powers  under this
              Agreement before the effective date of the withdrawal.  Before the
              effective  date of the  withdrawal,  the Operator  shall provide a
              statement to the Withdrawing Party and Other  Withdrawing  Parties
              for (1) their respective  shares of all  identifiable  costs under
              this  Article  15.3.1  and  (2)  their  respective   Participating
              Interest  shares of the  estimated  current  costs of plugging and
              abandoning  all  wells and  removing  all  Platforms,  Development
              Facilities,  and other  materiel and equipment  owned by the Joint

              the  estimated  salvage  value  of  the  assets  at  the  time  of
              abandonment,  as approved by vote.  This  statement  of  expenses,
              costs,  and salvage value shall be prepared by the Operator  under
              Exhibit "C". Before  withdrawing,  the Withdrawing Party and Other
              Withdrawing Parties shall either pay the Operator, for the benefit
              of the Remaining  Parties,  the amounts allocated to them as shown
              in  the  statement,   or  provide  security  satisfactory  to  the
              Remaining  Parties for all obligations  and liabilities  they have
              incurred and all obligations and liabilities  attributable to them
              before the effective date of the withdrawal.  All liens,  charges,
              and other  encumbrances,  including  but not limited to overriding
              royalties, net profits interest and production payments, which the
              Withdrawing Party and Other Withdrawing  Parties placed (or caused
              to be placed) on their Working  Interest shall be fully  satisfied
              or released prior to the effective date of its withdrawal  (unless
              the Remaining  Parties are willing to accept the Working  Interest
              subject to those liens, charges, and other encumbrances).

      15.3.2  Confidentiality

              The Withdrawing Party and Other Withdrawing  Parties will continue
              to be bound  by the  confidentiality  provisions  of  Article  7.3
              (Confidentiality)  after the effective  date of the withdrawal but
              will have no further access to technical  information  relating to
              activities or operations  under this  Agreement.  The  Withdrawing
              Party and Other Withdrawing  Parties are not required to return to
              the Remaining  Parties  Confidential  Data  acquired  prior to the
              effective date of the withdrawal.

      15.3.3  Emergencies and Force Majeure

              No Party may withdraw  during a Force  Majeure or  emergency  that
              poses a threat to life,  safety,  property or the  environment but
              may withdraw from this  Agreement  after  termination of the Force
              Majeure or emergency.  The Withdrawing Party and Other Withdrawing
              Parties remain liable for their share of all costs and liabilities
              arising from the Force  Majeure or  emergency,  including  but not
              limited to the drilling of relief wells,  containment  and cleanup
              of oil spills and pollution,  and all costs of debris removal made
              necessary by the Force Majeure or emergency.

                     RENTALS, ROYALTIES, AND OTHER PAYMENTS

16.1  Overriding Royalty and Other Burdens

      If the Working Interest or Participating Interest of a Party is subject to
      an  overriding  royalty,   Hydrocarbon  production  payment,  net  profits
      interest,   mortgage,   lien,  security  interest,   or  other  burden  or
      encumbrance,  other than  lessor's  royalty  and other  burdens  listed in
      Exhibit "A", the Party so burdened shall pay and bear all  liabilities and
      obligations  created or secured  by the  burden or  encumbrance  and shall
      indemnify and hold the other Parties  harmless from all claims and demands
      for payment  asserted by the owners of the burdens or  encumbrances.  If a
      Party becomes  entitled to an  assignment  under this  Agreement,  or as a
      result of Non-consent  Operations  hereunder becomes entitled to receive a
      relinquished  interest,  as provided in Article  13.2  (Relinquishment  of
      Interest),  otherwise belonging to a Non-participating Party whose Working
      Interest  in the  operations  is so  burdened  or  encumbered,  the  Party
      entitled to receive the assignment from the Non-participating Party or the
      relinquished  interest  of  the   Non-participating   Party's  Hydrocarbon
      production  shall  receive  same  free and clear of all such  burdens  and
      encumbrances, and the Non-participating Party whose interest is subject to
      the burdens and encumbrances shall hold the Participating Parties harmless
      for the burdens and encumbrances, and will bear same at its own expense.

16.2  Subsequently Created Interest

      Notwithstanding  anything in this  Agreement to the contrary,  if a Party,
      after  execution  of  this  Agreement,   creates  an  overriding  royalty,
      Hydrocarbon production payment, net profits interest, carried interest, or
      any other  interest out of its Working  Interest  which the Parties do not
      unanimously   agree  to  list  on   Exhibit   "A",   (hereinafter   called
      "Subsequently  Created Interest),  the Subsequently Created Interest shall
      be made  specifically  subject to this Agreement.  If the Party owning the
      interest  from which the  Subsequently  Created  Interest was  established
      fails to pay,  when due, its share of costs,  and if the proceeds from the
      sale of  Hydrocarbon  production  under Article 8.6 (Security  Rights) are
      insufficient for that purpose, or elects to abandon a well, or elects


                                       55
<PAGE>

      to relinquish its interest in the Contract Area, the Subsequently  Created
      Interest  shall be chargeable  with a pro rata portion of all costs in the
      same  manner  as if the  Subsequently  Created  Interest  were  a  Working
      Interest,  and  Operator  may  enforce  against the  Subsequently  Created
      Interest  the lien and other  rights  granted  or  recognized  under  this
      Agreement  to secure and enforce  collection  of costs  chargeable  to the
      Subsequently Created Interest. The rights of the owner of the Subsequently
      Created  Interest  shall be, and hereby  are,  subordinated  to the rights
      granted or recognized by Article 8.6 (Security Rights).

16.3  Payment of Rentals and Minimum Royalties

      Operator  shall  pay in a timely  manner,  for the  joint  account  of the
      Parties,  all  rental,  minimum  royalties,  and  other  similar  payments
      accruing under the Lease and shall,  on request,  submit  evidence of each
      such  payment to the  Parties.  Operator  shall not be held  liable to the
      other  Parties in damages  for loss of the Lease or  interest  therein if,
      through mistake or oversight,  a rental, minimum royalty, or other payment
      is not  paid or is  erroneously  paid.  The  loss of a Lease  or  interest
      therein resulting from the Operator's failure to pay, or erroneous payment
      of rental or minimum  royalty shall be a joint loss, and there shall be no
      readjustment of interests. For Hydrocarbon production delivered in kind by
      Operator  to  a   Non-operator   or  to  another  for  the  account  of  a
      Non-operator,  the  Non-operator  shall provide  Operator with information
      about the Non-operator's proceeds received or the value of the Hydrocarbon
      production  taken in kind in order  that  Operator  may make  payments  of
      minimum royalties due.

16.4  Non-participation in Payments

      A Party that desires not to pay its share of a rental, minimum royalty, or
      similar  payment  shall notify the other Parties in writing at least sixty
      (60) days before the payment is due.  Operator shall then make the payment
      for the benefit of the Parties  that do desire to maintain  the Lease.  In
      such event, the Non-participating  Party shall assign to the Participating
      Parties,  upon their  request,  the  portions of its interest in the Lease
      maintained by the payment.  The assigned  interest  shall be owned by each
      Participating  Party in  proportion  to its  Participating  Interest.  The
      assignment  shall  be made in  accordance  with  Article  27  (Successors,
      Assigns, [and Preferential Rights]).

16.5  Royalty Payments

      Each Party shall be responsible for and shall separately bear and properly
      pay or cause to be paid all royalty and other  amounts due on its share of
      Hydrocarbon   production   taken  in  accordance  with  state  or  federal
      regulations,  as may be amended from  time-to-time.  Adjustments  shall be
      made among the  Parties in  accordance  with  Exhibit  "E" (Gas  Balancing
      Agreement).  During a period when  Participating  Parties in a Non-consent
      Operation are receiving a  Non-participating  Party's share of Hydrocarbon
      production,  the  Participating  Parties  shall bear and properly  pay, or
      cause to be paid, the Lease royalty on the Hydrocarbon  production  taken,
      and shall hold the  Non-participating  Parties harmless from liability for
      the payment.

                                     TAXES

17.1  Property Taxes

      Operator  shall render  property  covered by this Agreement for ad valorem
      taxation, if applicable,  and shall pay the property taxes for the benefit
      of each  Party.  Operator  shall  charge  each  Party its share of the tax
      payments.  If the ad  valorem  taxes  are  based in whole or in part  upon
      separate valuations of each Party's Working Interest, then notwithstanding
      anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each Party's share of property
      taxes shall be in  proportion  to the tax value  generated by that Party's
      Working Interest.

17.2  Contest of Property Tax Valuation

      Operator shall timely and diligently protest to a final determination each
      tax valuation it deems unreasonable. Pending such determination,  Operator
      may elect to pay under protest.  Upon final determination,  Operator shall
      pay the taxes and the interest,  penalties,  and costs accrued as a result
      of the  protest.  In either  event,  Operator  shall charge each Party its
      share  of any  amounts  due,  and each  Party  shall  be  responsible  for
      reimbursing Operator for any such amounts paid.

17.3  Production and Severance Taxes

      Each Party shall pay, or cause to be paid,  all  production  and severance
      taxes due on Hydrocarbon production that it receives under this Agreement.

17.4  Other Taxes and Assessments

      Operator shall pay other applicable taxes (other than income taxes, excise
      taxes,  or other  similar types of taxes) or  assessments  and charge each
      Party its share.

18.1  Insurance

      Operator  shall provide and maintain the  insurance  prescribed in Exhibit
      "B" and charge those costs to the Joint Account.  No other insurance shall
      be carried for the benefit of the Parties under this Agreement,  except as
      provided in Exhibit "B".

18.2  Bonds

      Operator  shall  obtain and  maintain  all bonds or  financial  guarantees
      required by an  applicable  law,  regulation  or rule.  The costs of those
      bonds or  financial  guarantees  acquired  exclusively  for the conduct of
      activities  and operations  under this  Agreement  shall be charged to the
      Joint Account,


                                       57
<PAGE>

      including  an amount  equivalent  to the  reasonable  cost of that bond or
      financial guarantee if Operator provides that bond or guarantee itself and
      does  not  engage a third  party  to do so.  Operator  shall  require  all
      contractors  to obtain and  maintain all bonds  required by an  applicable
      law, regulation or rule.

                        LIABILITY, CLAIMS, AND LAWSUITS

19.1  Individual Obligations

      The  obligations,  duties,  and  liabilities  of the  Parties  under  this
      Agreement are several, not joint or collective.  Nothing in this Agreement
      shall ever be  construed  as  creating a  partnership  of any kind,  joint
      venture, agency relationship,  association, or other character of business
      entity  recognizable in law for any purpose.  In their relations with each
      other under this  Agreement,  the Parties  shall not be  considered  to be
      fiduciaries or to have established a confidential relationship,  except as
      specifically  provided  in Article 7.3  (Confidentiality)  and Article 7.4
      (Limited  Disclosure),  but rather shall be free to act at arm's length in
      accordance with their own respective self-interests. Each Party shall hold
      all other  Parties  harmless from liens and  encumbrances  on the Contract
      Area arising as a result of its acts.

19.2  Notice of Claim or Lawsuit

      If, on account of a matter  involving  activities or operations under this
      Agreement,  or  affecting  the  Contract  Area,  a claim is made against a
      Party,  or if a party outside of this Agreement  files a lawsuit against a
      Party,  or if a Party files a lawsuit,  or if a Party receives notice of a
      material  administrative  or judicial  hearing or other  proceeding,  that
      Party  shall  give  written  notice of the  claim,  lawsuit,  hearing,  or
      proceeding   ("Claim")  to  the  other   Parties  as  soon  as  reasonably
      practicable.

19.3  Settlements

      The Operator  may settle a Claim,  or multiple  Claims  arising out of the
      same incident,  involving activities or operations under this Agreement or
      affecting the Contract Area, if the aggregate  expenditure does not exceed
      One  Hundred  Fifty  Thousand  ($150,000.00)  and  if the  payment  is in
      complete settlement of these Claims. If the amount required for settlement
      exceeds this amount,  the Parties shall determine the further  handling of
      the Claims under Article 19.4 (Defense of Claims and Lawsuits).

19.4  Defense of Claims and Lawsuits

      The Operator shall supervise the handling, conduct, and prosecution of all
      Claims  involving   activities  or  operations  under  this  Agreement  or
      affecting the Contract Area. Claims may be settled in excess of the amount
      specified in Article 19.3 (Settlements) if the settlement is approved


                                       58
<PAGE>

      by vote in accordance with Article 6.1.2 of the  Participating  Parties in
      the  activity or operation  out of which the Claim arose,  but a Party may
      independently  settle  a  Claim  or  the  portion  of  a  Claim  which  is
      attributable  to its  Participating  Interest  share alone as long as that
      settlement  does not directly  adversely  affect the interest or rights of
      the other  Participating  Parties.  Charges for services  performed by the
      legal staff of a Party shall be made in  accordance  with Exhibit "C", but
      all other expenses  incurred by the Operator in the prosecution or defense
      of Claims for the  Parties,  together  with the amount paid to discharge a
      final  judgment,  are costs and shall be paid by the Parties in proportion
      to their Participating  Interest share in the activity or operation out of
      which the Claim arose.  The  employment  of outside  counsel,  but not the
      selection of that counsel,  requires approval by vote of the Participating
      Parties in the activity or operation out of which the Claim arose.  If the
      use of outside  counsel is approved,  the fees and expenses  incurred as a
      result  thereof  shall be charged to the  Parties in  proportion  to their
      Participating  Interest  share in the activity or  operation  out of which
      that Claim arose. Each Party has the right to hire its own outside counsel
      at its sole cost with respect to its own defense.

19.5  Liability for Damages

      UNLESS  SPECIFICALLY  PROVIDED OTHERWISE IN THIS AGREEMENT,  LIABILITY FOR
      LOSSES,  DAMAGES,  COSTS,  EXPENSES  OR  CLAIMS  INVOLVING  ACTIVITIES  OR
      OPERATIONS  UNDER THIS  AGREEMENT OR AFFECTING THE CONTRACT AREA WHICH ARE
      NOT COVERED BY OR IN EXCESS OF THE INSURANCE CARRIED FOR THE JOINT ACCOUNT
      SHALL BE BORNE BY EACH PARTY IN PROPORTION TO ITS  PARTICIPATING  INTEREST

                           INTERNAL REVENUE PROVISION

20.1  Internal Revenue Provision

      Notwithstanding  any  provision  in this  Agreement to the effect that the
      rights  and  liabilities  of  the  Parties  are  several,   not  joint  or
      collective, and that the Agreement and the activities and


                                       60
<PAGE>

      operations  under this  Agreement do not  constitute a  partnership  under
      state law, each Party elects to be excluded from the application of all or
      any part of the  provisions of Subchapter K, Chapter 1, Subtitle A, of the
      Internal  Revenue  Code of 1986,  as  amended,  or similar  provisions  of

      Agreement are regarded as a partnership.

                                   ARTICLE 21

                                  CONTRIBUTIONS

21.1  Notice of Contributions Other Than Advances for Sale of Production

      Each  Party  shall  promptly  notify  the other  Parties  of all offers of
      contributions  that it may obtain,  or  contributions  it is attempting to
      obtain,  for the drilling of a well or the  conducting  of an operation on
      the Contract Area.  Payments received as consideration for entering into a
      contract for the sale of  Hydrocarbon  production  from the Contract Area,
      loans,   and  other  financial   arrangements   shall  not  be  considered
      contributions  for the purpose of this Article 21. No Party shall  release
      or  obligate  itself  to  release   Confidential  Data  in  return  for  a
      contribution  from a third  party  without  prior  written  consent of the
      Participating  Parties or Parties  having the right to  participate in the
      well.

21.2  Cash Contributions

      If a  Party  receives  a cash  contribution  for  drilling  a well  on the
      Contract Area or conducting an activity or operation on the Contract Area,
      the cash contribution shall be paid to Operator, and Operator shall credit
      the amount  thereof to the Parties in  proportion  to their  Participating
      Interests in the well or the Platform and/or  Development  Facilities.  If
      the well is a Non-consent  Well, the amount of the  contribution  shall be
      deducted from the cost specified in Article 13.2.1 (a) before  computation
      of the amount to be recouped out of Hydrocarbon production.

21.3  Acreage Contributions

      If a Party receives an acreage  contribution for the drilling of a well on
      the  Contract  Area,  the  acreage  contribution  shall be  shared by each
      Participating  Party that accepts it in  proportion  to its  Participating
      Interest in the well. As between the Participating Parties, this Agreement
      shall apply separately to the acreage.

                            DISPOSITION OF PRODUCTION

22.1  Take-in-Kind Facilities

      Subject to Article 22.2, a Party may, at its sole cost and risk, construct
      Take-in-Kind  Facilities  to take its share of  Hydrocarbon  production in
      kind.

22.2  Duty to Take in Kind

      Each Party shall own and, at its own cost and risk,  shall take in kind or
      separately  dispose of its share of the oil, gas, and condensate  produced
      and saved from the Contract Area, exclusive of Hydrocarbon production used
      by Operator in activities or operations  conducted  under this  Agreement,
      subject to this Article 22. In order to avoid interference with operations
      on or regarding the Platform, the Development Facilities, and the Contract
      Area, a Party  exercising its right to construct  Take-in Kind  Facilities
      ("the Take in Kind  Party")  shall  provide  the  Operator  with a list of
      equipment  it  deems  necessary  for its  Take in  Kind  Facilities  ("the
      components")  along with its notice informing the Operator of its election
      to take in kind. If the Operator agrees to install and operate the Take-in
      Kind Facilities, the Operator shall purchase the components and install it
      on behalf of the Take in Kind Party at the Take in Kind  Party's sole risk
      and cost,  including,  but not  limited to, any fees,  penalties  or other
      costs incurred as a result of any  cancellation of placed orders as may be
      requested by the Take in Kind Party.  The Operator  shall provide the Take
      in Kind Party with  monthly  updates on the  progress of the  ordering and
      installation of the Take in Kind  Facilities.  The Operator,  based on the
      instructions  of Take in Kind Party,  shall install and operate all of the
      components.  The  Operator  shall  not be  responsible  for any  losses or
      damages  to the  components  or  the  Take  in  Kind  Party's  Hydrocarbon
      production  metered,  treated,  processed or transported by the components
      unless  such  losses or  damages  are the result of the  Operator's  gross
      negligence  or willful  misconduct.  If the  Operator  refuses or fails to
      install  the  Take-in  Kind  Facilities  by thirty  (30) days prior to the
      deadline  provided in Section 12.4,  the Take-in Kind Party shall have the
      right to install and operate the Take-in Kind  Facilities  providing  that
      such  operations  do not interfere  with  existing  operations or proposed
      operations that have been approved under terms of this Agreement.

22.3  Failure to Take Oil and Condensate in Kind

      Notwithstanding  Article 22.2 (Duty to Take in Kind),  if a Party fails to
      take in kind or  dispose of its share of the oil or  condensate,  Operator
      shall have the right,  but not the  obligation,  subject to  revocation at
      will by the Party owning the Hydrocarbon  production,  to purchase for its
      own account,  sell to others,  or otherwise  dispose of all or part of the
      Hydrocarbon  production at the same price at which Operator calculates and
      pays  lessor's  royalty  on its  own  portion  of the  oil or  condensate.
      Operator shall notify the non-taking Party when the option is exercised. A
      purchase  or sale by  Operator  of any other  Party's  share of the oil or
      condensate shall be for such


                                       62
<PAGE>

      reasonable periods of time as are consistent with the minimum needs of the
      industry under the circumstances,  but in no event shall a contract be for
      a period  in excess of one (1)  year.  Proceeds  of the oil or  condensate
      purchased,  sold, or otherwise  disposed of by Operator under this Article
      22.3 shall be paid to the Party that had, but did not exercise,  the right
      to take in kind and separately dispose of the oil or condensate. Operator,
      in  disposing  of  another  Party's  oil  or  condensate,   shall  not  be
      responsible for making any filing with regulatory agencies not required by
      law to be  made  by it in  respect  to  another  Party's  share  of oil or
      condensate.  Unless required by governmental authority having jurisdiction
      or by judicial  process,  no Party  shall be forced to share an  available
      market with a non-taking Party.

22.4  Failure to Take Gas in Kind

      Article 22.3 (Failure to Take Oil and  Condensate in Kind) shall not apply
      to gas produced  from the  Contract  Area.  In no event shall  Operator be
      responsible  for, or obligated to dispose of, another Party's share of gas
      production.  If for any  reason a Party  fails to take or market  its full
      share of gas as produced,  that Party may later take, market, or receive a
      cash accounting for its full share in accordance with Exhibit "E".

22.5  Expenses of Delivery in Kind

      A cost that is incurred by Operator in making  delivery of a Party's share
      of Hydrocarbons or disposing of same shall be paid by the Party.

23.1  Applicable Law

      THIS  AGREEMENT AND THE  RELATIONSHIP  OF THE PARTIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT
      SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND  INTERPRETED  UNDER  FEDERAL LAWS AND LAWS OF THE
      STATE OF TEXAS,  WITHOUT  REGARD TO  PRINCIPLES  OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS THAT
      WOULD OTHERWISE REFER THE MATTER TO THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION.

                    LAWS, REGULATIONS, AND NONDISCRIMINATION

24.1  Laws and Regulations

      This  Agreement  and  operations  under this  Agreement are subject to all
      applicable  laws,  rules,  regulations,  and  orders  by all  governmental
      authorities claiming jurisdiction now and in the future.

      A provision of this Agreement found to be contrary to or inconsistent with
      any such  law,  rule,  regulation,  or order  shall be deemed to have been
      modified accordingly.

24.2  Nondiscrimination

      In  performing  work under this  Agreement,  the Parties  shall comply and
      Operator  shall  require each  independent  contractor  to comply with the
      governmental  requirements in Exhibit "D" and with Articles 202(1) to (7),
      inclusive of Executive Order 11246, as amended.

                                   ARTICLE 25

                                  FORCE MAJEURE

25.1  Force Majeure

      If a Party is unable,  wholly or in part  because of a Force  Majeure,  to
      carry out its obligations under this Agreement,  other than the obligation
      to make money  payments,  that Party shall give the other  Parties  prompt
      written  notice  of the Force  Majeure  with  full  particulars  about it.
      Effective upon the date notice is given,  the obligations of the Party, so
      far as they are affected by the Force Majeure,  shall be suspended during,
      but no longer than, the  continuance of the Force Majeure.  Time is of the
      essence in the performance of this Agreement,  and every reasonable effort
      will be made by the Party to avoid delay or suspension of any work or acts
      to be  performed  under this  Agreement.  The  requirement  that the Force
      Majeure be remedied with all reasonable dispatch shall not require a Party
      to settle strikes or other labor difficulties.

                             SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS

      Except as provided in 26.1.1  (Exceptions to Transfer Notice),  a Transfer
      of Interest  shall be preceded by written  notice to the  Operator and the
      other Parties ("the transfer  notice").  Any Transfer of Interest shall be
      made  to  a  party  financially  capable  of  assuming  the  corresponding
      obligations under this Agreement.  No Transfer of Interest shall release a
      Party from its obligations and liabilities  under this Agreement,  and the
      security  rights under  Article 8.6 (Security  Rights)  shall  continue to
      burden the Working Interest transferred and to secure the payment of those
      obligations  and  liabilities.

      26.1.1  Exceptions  to  Transfer  Notice

              Notwithstanding  any  contrary  provision of this  Agreement,  the
              transfer notice is not required when a Party proposes to mortgage,
              pledge, hypothecate or grant a security


                                       64
<PAGE>

              interest  in all or a portion of its Working  Interest  (including
              Assignments of Hydrocarbon production executed as further security
              for  the  debt  secured  by  that  security  device),  any  wells,
              Platforms,  Development Facilities or other equipment. However, an
              encumbrance  arising  from  the  financing  transaction  shall  be
              expressly made subject and subordinated to this Agreement.

      26.1.2  Effective Date of Transfer of Interest

              A Transfer of Interest  becomes  effective  thirty (30) days after
              the day all  Parties  are In receipt of the  transfer  notice.  No
              Transfer of  Interest,  other than those  provided in Article 15.1
              (Right  to  Withdraw)  and  Article  26.1.1  (Exceptions  to Prior
              Written Notice),  is binding upon the Parties unless and until (i)
              the  assignor or assignee  provides all  remaining  Parties with a
              photocopy of a fully  executed  Transfer of Interest,  an executed
              MMS  "Designation of Operator" form and a designation of oil spill
              responsibility  form and (Ii) evidence of receipt of all necessary
              approvals by the MMS. The Parties  shall  promptly  undertake  all
              reasonable  actions  necessary to secure those approvals and shall
              execute and deliver all  documents  necessary to  effectuate  that
              Transfer  of  Interest.  All costs  attributable  to a Transfer of
              Interest are the sole  obligation of the assigning  Party.

      26.1.3  Form of  Transfer  of Interest

              Any Transfer of Interest  shall  incorporate  provisions  that the
              Transfer of Interest is subordinate to and made expressly  subject
              to this  Agreement and provide for the  assumption by the assignee
              of the  performance  of all of the assigning  Party's  obligations
              under this  Agreement.  Any Transfer of Interest not in compliance
              with this provision is voidable by the non-assigning Parties.

      26.1.4  Warranty

              Any Transfer of  Interest,  vesting or  relinquishment  of Working
              Interest  between the Parties under this  Agreement  shall be made
              without  warranty  of  title.  All  liens,   charges,   and  other
              encumbrances,  including but not limited to overriding  royalties,
              net profits interest and production payments, which a Party placed
              (or caused to be placed) on its  Working  Interest  shall be fully
              satisfied or released prior to the effective date of a Transfer of
              Interest,  vesting or  relinquishment  of Working Interest between
              that Party and  another  Party  under this  Agreement  (unless the
              other Party is willing to accept the Working  Interest  subject to
              those liens, charges, and other encumbrances).

      26.1.5  Minimum Transfer of Interest

              Unless unanimously agreed otherwise, any transfer to a third party
              shall be  limited to a minimum  Working  Interest  of ten  percent
              (10%). No assignment or transfer of any interest in this Agreement
              or any Lease subject to this  Agreement  shall be made that is not
              an undivided Working Interest in all of a Party's Working Interest
              in the entire Contract Area, unless otherwise  provided under this
              Agreement. If the Working Interest of any


                                       65
<PAGE>

              Party is  subsequently  conveyed or distributed to other entities,
              so that any one of them owns a Working  Interest  of less than ten
              percent  (10%),  such entities  collectively  shall be entitled to
              only a single joint  representative at meetings of the Parties and
              shall vote or act  collectively on all matters or elections.  Such
              Parties  shall be entitled to only a single set of logs,  samples,
              information  and reports and shall be considered as only one Party
              for all purposes under this Agreement.

26.2  Preferential Right to Purchase

      Any Transfer of Interest shall be subject to the following provisions:

      26.2.1  Notice of Proposed  Transfer of Interest

              The transfer  notice  shall  provide  full  information  about the
              proposed Transfer of Interest,  including, but not limited to, the
              name and address of the  prospective  assignee (who must be ready,
              willing  and able to acquire the  interest  and deliver the stated
              consideration  therefor),  the full consideration for the Transfer
              of  Interest  and all other  terms of the offer.  In the case of a
              sale of oil and gas  interests  that  includes  all or part of the
              assigning Party's Working Interest, or if the proposed Transfer of
              Interest  is  structured  as a  like-kind  exchange,  the  Working
              Interest  that is subject to the  Transfer  of  Interest  shall be
              separately valued and the transfer notice shall state the monetary
              value  attributed  to the  Working  Interest  by that  prospective
              assignee.  Article 26.2  (Preferential  Right to  Purchase)  shall
              apply only to the Working Interest that is subject to the Transfer
              of Interest.

      26.2.2  Exercise of Preferential Right to Purchase

              Within twenty (20) days from receipt of the transfer notice,  each
              non-assigning   Party  may  exercise  its  preferential  right  to
              purchase its Participating  Interest share of the Working Interest
              offered (on the same terms and conditions,  or on equivalent terms
              for a  non-cash  transaction  as  stated  in the  notice)  without
              reservations  or conditions by written  notice of that fact to all
              of the Parties. If one or more non-assigning  Parties, but not all
              non-assigning  Parties,   exercise  their  preferential  right  to
              purchase (the "Acquiring Parties"),  then within fifteen (15) days
              of the  termination  of the twenty (20 day notice period set forth
              in the previous  sentence,  each Acquiring  Party may exercise its
              preferential right to purchase its Participating Interest share of
              the Working Interest offered based on its  Participating  Interest
              share as a  non-assigning  Party  or  based  on its  Participating
              Interest share as an Acquiring  Party. If, within the fifteen (15)
              day notice period set forth in the previous sentence, an Acquiring
              Party does not  exercise  its  preferential  right to purchase its
              Participating Interest share of the Working Interest offered based
              on its Participating Interest share as an Acquiring Party but does
              exercise  its  preferential  right to purchase  its  Participating
              Interest  share  of the  Working  Interest  offered  based  on its
              Participating  Interest share as a non-assigning  Party,  then the
              other Acquiring Parties shall have ten

              consideration   for  the  Transfer  of  Interest  and  notify  the
              assigning  Party of that fact.  If, within the ten (10) day period

              assigning Party shall be free to complete the proposed  conveyance
              on the terms disclosed in the notice. If the non-assigning Parties
              or the Acquiring  Parties agree to pay the full  consideration for

              third party offer,  the assigning Party shall transfer the Working
              Interest to the  non-assigning  Parties or  Acquiring  Parties who
              exercised their  preferential right to purchase under this Article
              26 (Successors,  Assigns and Preferential Rights). The Transfer of
              Interest shall be concluded within a reasonable time, but no later

                     in all or a  portion  of its  Working  Interest  (including

                     security for the debt secured by that security device), or

                          ("Code");

                     (2)  a merger, reorganization or consolidation;

                     (3)  a  Transfer  of  Interest  of  substantially  all of a
                          Party's  exploration and production  properties in the
                          Gulf of Mexico; or

                     (4)  a Transfer of Interest to an Affiliate,  provided that
                          there  is  included  in the  Transfer  of  Interest  a
                          provision  that if for any reason the assignee  ceases
                          to be an  Affiliate of the  Transferring  Party within
                          one (1) year after Transfer of Interest,  those rights
                          shall be immediately  reassigned to the original Party
                          before the  assignee  ceases to be an  Affiliate,  and
                          that all  rights of the  assignee  in the Lease  shall
                          terminate if the re-assignment does not place.

      26.2.4  Completion of Transfer of Interest

              If the proposed  Transfer of Interest is not executed and filed of
              record with the MMS within three (3) months  after  receipt of the
              transfer notice by the non-assigning  Parties,  or if the terms of
              the  proposed  Transfer  of  Interest  conveyance  are  materially
              altered, the

              proposed Transfer of Interest shall be deemed  withdrawn,  and the
              Working  Interest  included in the  proposed  Transfer of Interest
              shall again be governed by this Article 26.2  (Preferential  Right
              to Purchase).

                           ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS

27.1  Term

      This  Agreement  shall remain in effect so long as a Contract Area remains
      in effect  and  thereafter  until (a) all wells  have been  abandoned  and
      plugged or turned over to the Parties  owning an interest in the  Contract
      Area on which  the  wells  are  located;  (b) all  Platforms,  Development
      Facilities, and equipment have been disposed by the Operator in accordance
      with Article 14  (Abandonment,  Salvage,  and Surplus);  (c) all Claims as
      defined in Article 19 (Liability,  Claims, and Lawsuits) have been settled
      or otherwise  disposed of; and (d) there has been a final  accounting  and

      Successor Operator),  this Agreement will terminate if no Party is willing
      to become Operator,  effective after all conditions in clauses (a) through
      (d)  above  have  been  completed.   In  accordance  with  Article  15.2.1
      (Unanimous Withdrawal), this Agreement will terminate if all Parties elect
      to withdraw,  effective  after all  conditions  in clauses (a) through (d)
      above have been completed. Termination of this Agreement shall not relieve
      a  Party  of  a  liability  or  obligation   accrued  or  incurred  before
      termination  and is without  prejudice to all  continuing  confidentiality
      obligations or other obligations in this Agreement.

27.2  Waiver

      A term,  provision,  covenant,  representation,  warranty, or condition of
      this  Agreement may be waived only by written  instrument  executed by the
      Party  waiving  compliance.  The  failure  or  delay  of a  Party  in  the
      enforcement or exercise of the rights  granted under this Agreement  shall
      not  constitute  a waiver of said rights nor shall it be  considered  as a
      basis for  estoppel.  Time is of the  essence in the  performance  of this
      Agreement and all time limits shall be strictly construed and enforced.

27.3  Waiver of Right to Partition

      Each  Party  waives  the right to bring an  action  for  partition  of its
      interest in the Contract Area, wells,  Platform,  Development  Facilities,
      and other equipment held under this  Agreement,  and covenants that during
      the  existence  of this  Agreement  it shall not  resort at any time to an
      action at law or in equity to partition any or all of the Leases and lands
      or personal property subject to this Agreement.

27.4  Compliance With Laws and Regulations

      This Agreement,  and all activities or operations conducted by the Parties
      under this Agreement, are expressly subject to, and shall comply with, all

      governmental authorities having jurisdiction over the Contract Area.

      27.4.1  Severance of Invalid Provisions

              If, for any reason  and for so long as, a clause or  provision  of
              this Agreement is held by a court of competent  jurisdiction to be
              illegal, invalid,  unenforceable or unconscionable under a present
              or future law (or interpretation  thereof),  the remainder of this
              Agreement  will not be affected by that  illegality or invalidity.
              An illegal or invalid  provision  will be deemed severed from this
              Agreement,  as if this  Agreement  had been  executed  without the
              illegal or invalid  provision.  The  surviving  provisions of this
              Agreement  will remain in full force and effect unless the removal
              of the  illegal  or  invalid  provision  destroys  the  legitimate
              purposes of this Agreement; in which event this Agreement shall be
              null and void.

      27.4.2  Fair and Equal Employment

              Agreement by reference.  In performing  work under this Agreement,
              the Parties shall comply with (and the Operator shall require each
              independent   contractor   to  comply   with)   the   governmental
              requirements  in  Exhibit  "E"  that  pertain  to   non-segregated

and their respective heirs, successors, transferees and assigns.

1.13  Percentage Interest: shall mean the percentage or decimal interest of each
Party in the Gas produced  from the  Balancing  Area  pursuant to the  Operating
Agreement covering the Balancing Area.

1.14  Royalty:  shall mean payments on production of Gas from the Balancing Area
to all owners of royalties, overriding royalties, production payments or similar
interests.

1.15  Underproduced  Party:  shall mean any Party having taken a lesser quantity
of Gas from the Balancing Area than the Percentage Interest of such Party in the
cumulative quantity of all Gas produced from the Balancing Area.

1.16  Underproduction: shall mean the deficiency between the cumulative quantity
of Gas taken by a Party and its Percentage  Interest in the cumulative  quantity
of all Gas produced from the Balancing Area.

1.17  Winter  Period:  shall mean the  month(s) of November  and December in one
calendar year and the month(s) of January,  February and March in the succeeding
calendar year.

2.    BALANCING AREA

2.1   If this Agreement covers more than one Balancing Area, it shall be applied
as if each Balancing Area were covered by separate but identical agreements. All
balancing  hereunder  shall be on the basis of Gas taken from the Balancing Area
measured in MMBtus.

2.2   In the event that all or part of the Gas deliverable from a Balancing Area
is or becomes subject to one or more maximum lawful prices,  any Gas not subject
to price controls  shall be considered as produced from a single  Balancing Area
and Gas  subject to each  maximum  lawful  price  category  shall be  considered
produced from a separate Balancing Area.

3.    RIGHT OF PARTIES TO TAKE GAS

3.1   Each Party  desiring  to take Gas will notify the  Operator,  or cause the
Operator to be notified of the volumes  nominated,  the name of the transporting
pipeline and the  pipeline  contract  number (if  available)  and meter  station
relating to such delivery, sufficiently in advance for the Operator, acting with
reasonable diligence, to meet all nomination and other requirements. Operator is
authorized to deliver the volumes so nominated and confirmed (if confirmation is
required)  to the  transporting  pipeline in  accordance  with the terms of this
Agreement.  Operator shall provide each Party with an estimate of its Full Share
of Current  Production and the estimated  sustainable Gas volumes for Makeup Gas
by the 20th  calendar  day of the month  prior to the month of  production.  The
Parties  recognize that  Operator's  estimates are no more than  estimates,  and
these  estimated  volumes may vary from the actual Gas sales volumes  during the
month.  Operator will, insofar as reasonably possible and practical,  notify (by
telephone or  facsimile)  the Parties of  significant  variances  in  production
volumes  relative to  nominations  where  these  variances  could be  reasonably
expected to result in penalties  being  imposed by pipelines  or  purchasers  or
both.  Operator will use  reasonable  efforts to notify all Parties of scheduled
operations that will impact sustained production.

3.2   Each Party  shall make a  reasonable,  good faith  effort to take its Full
Share of Current  Production  each month,  to the extent that such production is
required to maintain  leases in effect,  to protect the producing  capacity of a
well  or  reservoir,   to  preserve  correlative  rights,  or  to  maintain  oil
production.

3.3   When a Party  fails  for any  reason  to take  its Full  Share of  Current
Production  (as such Share may be  reduced by the right of the other  Parties to
make up for  Underproduction  as provided  herein),  the other  Parties shall be
entitled  to take  any Gas  which  such  Party  fails  to  take.  To the  extent
practicable, such


                                       94
<PAGE>

Gas  shall  be made  available  initially  to each  Underproduced  Party  in the
proportion that its Percentage Interest in the Balancing Area bears to the total
Percentage Interests of all Underproduced  Parties desiring to take such Gas. If
all such Gas is not taken by the  Underproduced  Parties,  the portion not taken
shall then be made available to the other Parties in the  proportion  that their
respective  Percentage  Interests  in the  Balancing  Area  bear  to  the  total
Percentage Interests of such Parties.

3.4   All Gas  taken  by a Party  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of this
Agreement,  regardless of whether such Party is  underproduced  or overproduced,
shall be regarded as Gas taken for its own account with title  thereto  being in
such taking Party.

3.5   Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of Section 3.3 hereof,  no  Overproduced
Party shall be entitled in any month to take any Gas in excess of three  hundred
percent (300%) of its Percentage  Interest of the Balancing Area's  then-current
Maximum Monthly Availability;  provided, however, that this limitation shall not
apply to the  extent  that it would  preclude  production  that is  required  to
maintain  leases in  effect,  to protect  the  producing  capacity  of a well or
reservoir,  to  preserve  correlative  rights,  or to maintain  oil  production.
"Maximum  Monthly  Availability"  shall mean the maximum average monthly rate of
production at which Gas can be delivered from the Balancing  Area, as determined
by the  Operator,  considering  the  maximum  efficient  well rate for each well
within the  Balancing  Area,  the maximum  allowable(s)  set by the  appropriate
regulatory  agency,  mode of operation,  production  facility  capabilities  and
pipeline pressures.

3.6   In the  event  that a Party  fails to make  arrangements  to take its Full
Share of Current  Production  required  to be  produced  to  maintain  leases in
effect,  to protect the producing  capacity of a well or reservoir,  to preserve
correlative  rights,  or to maintain oil  production,  the Operator may sell any
part of such Party's Full Share of Current  Production  that such Party fails to
take for the account of such Party and render to such Party, on a current basis,
the full  proceeds  of the sale,  less any  reasonable  marketing,  compression,
treating, gathering or transportation costs incurred directly in connection with
the  sale of  such  Full  Share  of  Current  Production.  In  making  the  sale
contemplated  herein,  the Operator shall be obligated only to obtain such price
and conditions for the sale as are reasonable under the  circumstances and shall
not be obligated to share any of its  markets.  Any such sale by Operator  under
the  terms  hereof  shall  be only for such  reasonable  periods  of time as are
consistent  with  the  minimum  needs  of  the  industry  under  the  particular
circumstances,   but  in  no  event   for  a  period  in  excess  of  one  year.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 3.4 hereof, Gas sold by Operator for a
Party  under  the  provisions  hereof  shall be  deemed  to be Gas taken for the
account  of  such  Party.  Notwithstanding  anything  contained  herein  to  the
contrary,  no agency  relationship or other relationship of trust and confidence
shall be created by such sale and  Operator  shall only be  required to act as a
reasonably prudent operator.

4.    IN-KIND BALANCING

4.1   Effective  the first day of any calendar  month  following at least thirty
(30) days prior written  notice to the  Operator,  any  Underproduced  Party may
begin taking, in addition to its Full Share of Current Production and any Makeup
Gas  taken  pursuant  to  Section  3.3 of this  Agreement,  a share  of  current
production  determined by multiplying  fifty percent (50%) of the Full Shares of
Current Production of all Overproduced  Parties by a fraction,  the numerator of
which is the Percentage Interest of such Underproduced Party and the denominator
of which is the total of the Percentage  Interests of all Underproduced  Parties
desiring to take Makeup Gas. In no event will an Overproduced  Party be required
to provide more than fifty percent (50%) of its Full Share of Current Production
for Makeup Gas. The Operator will promptly  notify all  Overproduced  Parties of
the election of an Underproduced Party to begin taking Makeup Gas.

4.2   Notwithstanding  the provisions of Section 4.1, no Overproduced Party will
be required to provide more than twenty-five  percent (25%) of its Full Share of
Current Production for Makeup Gas during the Winter Period.


                                       95
<PAGE>

5.    STATEMENT OF GAS BALANCES

5.1   The  Operator  will  maintain  appropriate  accounting  on a  monthly  and
cumulative  basis of the  volumes of Gas that each Party is  entitled to receive
and the volumes of Gas actually taken or sold for each Party's  account.  Within
forty-five (45) days after the month of production,  the Operator will furnish a
statement  for  such  month  showing  (1) each  Party's  Full  Share of  Current
Production,  (2) the total volume of Gas actually taken or sold for each Party's
account,  (3) the  difference  between  the volume  taken by each party and that
Party's  Full  Share  of  Current   Production,   (4)  the   Overproduction   or
Underproduction  of  each  Party,  and (5)  other  data  as  recommended  by the
provisions of the Council of Petroleum Accountants Societies Bulletin No. 24, as
amended or supplemented  hereafter.  Each Party taking Gas will promptly provide
to the  Operator  any data  required  by the  Operator  for  preparation  of the
statements required hereunder.

5.2   If any  Party  fails to  provide  the data  required  herein  for four (4)
consecutive production months, the Operator, or where the Operator has failed to
provide  data,  another  Party,  may  audit  the  production  and Gas  sales and
transportation  volumes of the non-reporting Party to provide the required data.
Such audit shall be conducted  only after  reasonable  notice and during  normal
business hours in the office of the Party whose records are being  audited.  All
costs  associated  with such audit  will be charged to the  account of the Party
failing to provide the required data.

6.    PAYMENTS ON PRODUCTION

6.1   Each  Party  taking Gas shall pay or cause to be paid all  production  and
severance taxes due on all volumes of Gas actually taken by such Party.

6.2   Each  Party  shall pay or cause to be paid  Royalty  due with  respect  to
Royalty  owners to whom it is  accountable  based on the volume of Gas  actually
taken for its account.

6.3   In the  event  that  any  governmental  authority  requires  that  Royalty
payments be made on any other basis than that  provided  for in this  Section 6,
each Party agrees to make such Royalty payments  accordingly,  commencing on the
effective date required by such governmental authority,  and the method provided
for herein shall be thereby superseded.

7.    CASH SETTLEMENTS

7.1   Upon the earlier of the plugging  and  abandonment  of the last  producing
interval in the Balancing  Area, the  termination of the Operating  Agreement or
any pooling or unit agreement covering the Balancing Area, or at any time no Gas
is taken from the Balancing Area for a period of twelve (12) consecutive months,
any  Party  may give  written  notice  calling  for cash  settlement  of the Gas
production  imbalances  among the  Parties.  Such  notice  shall be given to all
Parties in the Balancing Area.

7.2   Within sixty (60) days after the notice calling for cash settlement  under
Section 7.1, the Operator will  distribute to each Party a Final Gas  Settlement
Statement  detailing the quantity of  Overproduction  owed by each  Overproduced
Party to each  Underproduced  Party  and  identifying  the  month to which  such
Overproduction  is attributed,  pursuant to the  methodology  set out in Section
7.4.

7.3   Within  sixty  (60)  days  after  receipt  of  the  Final  Gas  Settlement
Statement, each Overproduced Party will pay to each Underproduced Party entitled
to settlement  the  appropriate  cash  settlement,  accompanied  by  appropriate
accounting  detail. At the time of payment,  the Overproduced  Party will notify
the Operator of the Gas imbalance settled by the Overproduced Party's payment.

7.4   The amount of the cash settlement  will be based on the proceeds  received
by the Overproduced Party under an Arm's Length Agreement for the Gas taken from
time to time by the  Overproduced  Party in excess of the  Overproduced  Party's
Full Share of Current Production. Any Makeup Gas taken by the


                                       96
<PAGE>

Underproduced Party prior to monetary  settlement  hereunder will be  applied to
offset Overproduction chronologically in the order of accrual.

7.5   The values used for calculating the cash settlement under Section 7.4 will
include all proceeds received for the sale of the Gas by the Overproduced  Party
calculated at the Balancing  Area,  after  deducting any production or severance
taxes  paid  and any  Royalty  actually  paid by the  Overproduced  Party  to an
Underproduced  Party's Royalty owner(s), to the extent said payments amounted to
a discharge of said  Underproduced  Party's Royalty  obligation,  as well as any
reasonable marketing,  compression,  treating, gathering or transportation costs
incurred directly in connection with the sale of the Overproduction.

7.5.1 For  Overproduction  sold  under a gas  purchase  contract  providing  for
payment  based on a percentage of the proceeds  obtained by the  purchaser  upon
resale of residue  gas and liquid  hydrocarbons  extracted  at a gas  processing
plant,  the values used for calculating  cash  settlement will include  proceeds
received  by the  Overproduced  Party for both the liquid  hydrocarbons  and the
residue gas attributable to the Overproduction.

7.5.2 For Overproduction  processed for the account of the Overproduced Party at
a gas  processing  plant for the  extraction  of liquid  hydrocarbons,  the full
quantity of the Overproduction will be valued for purposes of cash settlement at
the prices  received by the  Overproduced  Party for the sale of the residue gas
and the sale of liquid hydrocarbons attributable to the Overproduction.

7.6   To the extent the Overproduced Party did not sell all Overproduction under
an Arm's Length  Agreement,  the cash  settlement  will be based on the weighted
average  price  received  by the  Overproduced  Party  for any gas sold from the
Balancing  Area under Arm's  Length  Agreements  during the months to which such
Overproduction  is  attributed.  In the event that no sales under  Arm's  Length
Agreements  were made during any such month,  the cash settlement for such month
will be based on the spot sales prices  published for the applicable  geographic
area in the first  issue of Inside  FERC's  Gas  Market  Report or  Natural  Gas
Intelligence  for such month.  Should  these  publications  cease to exist,  the
Parties shall mutually agree to a pricing bulletin.

7.7   Interest  compounded  at  the  rate  as  specified  in  COPAS,  Accounting
Procedures,  Exhibit "C" of the Operating  Agreement to which this Gas Balancing
Agreement is attached or the maximum  lawful rate of interest  applicable to the
Balancing Area, whichever is less, will accrue for all amounts due under Section
7.1,  beginning  the first day  following  the date  payment is due  pursuant to
Section 7.3.  Such interest  shall be borne by the Operator or any  Overproduced
Party in the proportion  that their  respective  delays beyond the deadlines set
out in Sections 7.2 and 7.3 contributed to the accrual of the interest.

7.8   In lieu of the cash  settlement  required by Section 7.3, an  Overproduced
Party  may  deliver  to  the   Underproduced   Party  an  offer  to  settle  its
Overproduction in-kind and at such rates,  quantities,  times and sources as may
be agreed upon by the  Underproduced  Party.  If the Parties are unable to agree
upon the manner in which such in-kind  settlement  gas will be furnished  within
sixty (60) days after the  Overproduced  Party's offer to settle in kind,  which
period may be extended by  agreement of said  Parties,  the  Overproduced  Party
shall make a cash  settlement  as provided in Section  7.3. The making of an in-
kind  settlement  offer  under this  Section  7.8 will not delay the  accrual of
interest on the cash settlement should the Parties fail to reach agreement on an
in-kind settlement.

8.    OPERATING COSTS

      Nothing in this Agreement shall change or affect any Party's obligation to
pay its proportionate share of all costs and liabilities  incurred in operations
on or in connection  with the Balancing  Area, as its share thereof Is set forth
in the  Operating  Agreement,  irrespective  of whether any Party Is at any time
selling  and using Gas or  whether  such sales or use are in  proportion  to its
Percentage Interest in the Balancing Area.


                                       97
<PAGE>

9.    LIQUIDS

      The Parties shall share proportionately in and own all liquid hydrocarbons
recovered  with  Gas by  field  equipment  operated  for the  joint  account  in
accordance with their Percentage Interests in the Balancing Area.

10.   AUDIT RIGHTS

      Notwithstanding  any  provision in this  Agreement or any other  agreement
between the Parties  hereto,  and further  notwithstanding  any  termination  or
cancellation  of this  Agreement,  for a period of two (2) years from the end of
the calendar year in which any  information to be furnished under Section 5 or 7
hereof is  supplied,  any Party shall have the right to audit the records of any
other  Party  regarding  quantity,  including  but not  limited  to  information
regarding Btu-content. Any Underproduced Party shall have the right for a period
of two (2) years from the end of the calendar year in which any cash  settlement
is received pursuant to Section 7 to audit the records of any Overproduced Party
as to all matters  concerning  values,  including but not limited to information
regarding  prices and disposition of Gas from the Balancing Area. Any such audit
shall be conducted at the expense of the Party or Parties  desiring  such audit,
and shall be conducted, after reasonable notice, during normal business hours in
the office of the Party  whose  records  are being  audited.  Each Party  hereto
agrees to  maintain  records as to the volumes and prices of Gas sold each month
and the volumes of Gas used in its own  operations,  along with the Royalty paid
on any such Gas used by a Party in its own operations. The audit rights provided
for in this Section 10 shall be in addition to those provided for in Section 5.2
of this Agreement.

11.   MISCELLANEOUS

11.1  As  between  the  Parties,  in the  event  of  any  conflict  between  the
provisions of this Agreement and the provisions of any gas sales contract, or in
the event of any  conflict  between the  provisions  of this  Agreement  and the
provisions of the Operating  Agreement,  the provisions of this Agreement  shall
govern.

11.2  Each Party agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless all other Parties
from and against any and all liability for any claims,  which may be asserted by
any third party which now or hereafter stands in a contractual relationship with

or any  activities  of such  indemnifying  Party,  under the  provisions of this
Agreement,  and does further agree to save the other  Parties  harmless from all
judgments or damages sustained and costs incurred in connection therewith.

11.3  Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,  Operator is authorized to
administer the provisions of this Agreement,  but shall have no liability to the
other parties for losses  sustained or liability  incurred which arise out of or
in connection with the performance of Operator's duties  hereunder,  except such
as may result from Operator's gross negligence or willful  misconduct.  Operator
shall  not  be  liable  to  any  Underproduced  Party  for  the  failure  of any
Overproduced Party (other than Operator) to pay any amounts owed pursuant to the
terms hereof.

11.4  This  Agreement  shall  remain in full force and effect for as long as the
Operating  Agreement  shall remain in force and effect as to the Balancing Area,
and thereafter  until the Gas accounts  between the Parties are settled in full,
and shall inure to the benefit of and be binding  upon the Parties  hereto,  and
their respective heirs,  successors,  legal representatives and assigns, if any.
The Parties  hereto agree to give notice of the  existence of this  Agreement to
any  successor  in  interest  of any such  Party  and to  provide  that any such

<PAGE>

11.6  This  Agreement  shall bind the Parties in accordance  with the provisions
hereof,  and nothing  herein shall be construed or  interpreted  as creating any
rights in any person or entity not a signatory hereto, or as being a stipulation
in favor of any such person or entity.

11.7  If   contemporaneously   with  this  Agreement  becoming   effective,   or
thereafter,  any Party  requests  that any other  Party  execute an  appropriate
memorandum or notice of this  Agreement in order to give third parties notice of
record  of same  and  submits  same  for  execution  in  recordable  form,  such
memorandum  or notice shall be duly  executed by the Party to which such request
is made and delivered promptly thereafter to the Party making the request.  Upon
receipt, the Party making the request shall cause the memorandum or notice to be
duly recorded in the  appropriate  real property or other records  affecting the
Balancing Area.

11.8  In the event federal tax regulations require a uniform method of computing
taxable income by all Parties, the Parties agree to negotiate in good faith upon
such a uniform  method that is in accordance  with the  requirement  of said tax
regulations.

12.   ASSIGNMENT AND RIGHTS UPON ASSIGNMENT

12.1  Subject  to  the  provisions  of  Sections  12.2  and  12.3  hereof,   and
notwithstanding  anything in this Agreement or in the Operating Agreement to the
contrary,  if any Party assigns (including any sale, exchange or other transfer)
any of its  working  interest  in the  Balancing  Area  when  such  Party  is an
Underproduced  or  Overproduced  Party,  the assignment or other act of transfer
shall, insofar as the Parties hereto are concerned,  include all interest of the
assigning or transferring Party in the Gas, all rights to receive or obligations
to provide or take Makeup Gas and all rights to receive or  obligations  to make
any monetary  payment which may  ultimately  be due  hereunder,  as  applicable.
Operator  and each of the  other  Parties  hereto  shall  thereafter  treat  the
assignment  accordingly,  and the  assigning  or  transferring  Party shall look
solely  to its  assignee  or other  transferee  for any  interest  in the Gas or
monetary  payment that such Party may have or to which it may be  entitled,  and
shall  cause  its  assignee  or  other  transferee  to  assume  its  obligations
hereunder.

12.2  Notwithstanding  anything in this Agreement  (including but not limited to
the  provisions  of Section  12.1 hereof) or in the  Operating  Agreement to the
contrary,  and subject to the provisions of Section 12.3 hereof, in the event an
Overproduced Party intends to sell,  assign,  exchange or otherwise transfer any
of its interest in a Balancing  Area,  such  Overproduced  Party shall notify in
writing  the  other  working  interest  owners  who are  Parties  hereto in such
Balancing  Area of such fact at least  sixty  (60)  days  prior to  closing  the
transaction.  Such notice shall contain a gas settlement statement detailing the
quantity of Overproduction  owed by the Overproduced Party to each Underproduced
Party  and the  value of such  Overproduction,  calculated  in  accordance  with
Sections 7.4 through 7.6 hereof.  Thereafter, any Underproduced Party may demand
from such Overproduced  Party in writing,  within thirty (30) days after receipt
of the  Overproduced  Party's notice,  a cash settlement of its  Underproduction
from the Balancing  Area.  The Operator shall be notified of any such demand and
of any cash settlement  pursuant to this Section 12, and the  Overproduction and
Underproduction of each Party shall be adjusted accordingly. Any cash settlement
pursuant  to this  Section  12  shall be paid by the  Overproduced  Party at the
closing of the  transaction  in which the  Overproduced  Party  sells,  assigns,
exchanges or otherwise  transfers  its interest in a Balancing  Area on the same
basis as otherwise set forth in Sections 7.3 through 7.6 hereof,  and shall bear
interest at the rate set forth in Section 7.7  hereof,  beginning  the first day
following the closing of the Overproduced Party's sale, assignment,  exchange or
transfer  of its  interest  in the  Balancing  Area for any  amounts  not  paid.
Provided,  however,  if any  Underproduced  Party  does not so demand  such cash
settlement of its  Underproduction  from the Balancing Area, such  Underproduced
Party shall look  exclusively to the assignee or other  successor in interest of
the  Overproduced  Party giving notice  hereunder for the  satisfaction  of such
Underproduced  Party's  Underproduction  in  accordance  with the  provisions of
Section 12.1 hereof.

12.3  The provisions of this Section 12 shall not be applicable in the event any
Party   mortgages   its   interest  or  disposes  of  its  interest  by  merger,
reorganization,  consolidation or sale of  substantially  all of its assets to a
subsidiary  or  parent  company,  or to any  company  in  which  any  parent  or
subsidiary of such Party owns a majority of the stock of such company.

of the  mutual  covenants  and  agreements  contained  in this  Agreement,  each

holds,  owns, or controls any interest in the Contract Area; and (c) all rights,
claims,  general  intangibles,  and proceeds,  whether now existing or hereafter

or future operating, farmout, bidding, pooling, unitization, and communitization
agreements,  assignments,  and subleases, whether or not described in Attachment
"1", to the extent, and only to the extent,  that such agreements,  assignments,
and subleases cover or include any of its rights, titles, and interests, whether

portion of the Lease or the  Contract  Area,  and all units  created by any such

              Obligations and  Indebtedness  of  Non-Operators  Secured.  To the
extent  permissible  under  applicable  law,  the liens and  security  interests
granted by each  Non-Operator in this Agreement shall secure (a) the performance
of and payment by such  Non-Operator  to the Operator of all of its  obligations
and  indebtedness,  whether  now  owed or  hereafter  arising  pursuant  to this
Agreement,  and (b) the payment of all expenses incurred by the Operator and the
Participating  Parties for (or on account of) any and all  operations  conducted

or purchasers of the defaulting Non-Operator's production and collect such Costs
and  other  expenses  out  of the  proceeds  from  the  sale  of the  defaulting
Non-Operator's  share of  production  until the amount  owed has been paid.  The
Operator  shall have the right to offset the amount owed  against  the  proceeds
from  the  sale of such  defaulting  Non-Operator's  share  of  production.  Any
purchaser  of such  production  shall  be  entitled  to  rely on the  Operator's
statement  concerning  the  amount  of  Costs  and  other  expenses  owed by the
defaulting  Non-Operator and payment made to the Operator by any purchaser shall
be  binding  and  conclusive  as  between  such  purchaser  and such  defaulting
Non-Operator.

receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby  acknowledged,  and in consideration
of the mutual  covenants and agreements  contained in this Agreement,  to secure
the performance of and payment by the Operator to each of the  Non-Operators  of
all obligations and indebtedness,  whether now owed or hereafter arising, of the
Operator to such Non-Operators  pursuant to this Agreement,  the Operator grants
to each such Non-Operator a lien upon the following described property:

any Working  Interest,  whether now owned and existing or hereafter  acquired or
arising,  in and to (1) the  Lease,  subject  to any  surface  acreage  or depth

all or any part of the property  described in and covered by such  terminated or
expired Lease,  right-of-way,  or other document, to the extent, and only to the
extent, such new oil, gas and mineral leases,


                                       103
<PAGE>

rights-of-way,  or other  documents may cover the property that was described in

contractual rights,  operating rights,  leasehold interests,  working interests,
royalty  interests,  overriding  royalty  interests,  non-participating  royalty
interests, mineral interests, production payments, net profits interests, or any
other  interest  measured by or payable out of  production of oil, gas, or other
minerals from the Lease or production attributable to the Contract Area (as such
interests  may be enlarged by the discharge of any payments out of production or
by the removal of any charges or encumbrances).

              Security  Interest  in Favor of the  Non-Operators.  For  valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and
in  consideration  of the mutual  covenants  and  agreements  contained  in this
Agreement,  to secure the  performance of and payment by the Operator to each of
the  Non-Operators  of all  obligations  and  indebtedness,  whether now owed or
hereafter  arising,  of the  Operator  to such  Non-Operators  pursuant  to this
Agreement,  the  Operator  grants  to each  of the  Non-Operators  a  continuing
security  interest  in and to all of  its  rights,  titles,  interests,  claims,
general  intangibles,  proceeds,  and products thereof,  whether now existing or
hereafter  acquired or arising,  in and to (a) all oil, gas, and other  minerals
produced from the offshore  blocks  covered by the Lease or the Contract Area or
attributable  to the Lease or the Contract Area when produced;  (b) all accounts
receivable  accruing  or arising as a result of the sale of such oil,  gas,  and
other  minerals  (including,  without  limitation,  accounts  arising  from  gas
imbalances or from the sale of oil, gas and other minerals at the wellhead); (c)
all cash or other  proceeds from the sale of such oil,  gas, and other  minerals
once  produced;  and (d) all  platforms,  wells,  facilities,  fixtures,  tools,
tubular goods, other personal  property,  whether now or hereafter placed on the
offshore  blocks covered by the Lease or the Contract Area or maintained or used
or obtained for use in connection with the ownership, use or exploitation of the
Lease or the Contract Area, and other surface and  sub-surface  equipment of any
kind or character  located on or attributable to the Lease or the Contract Area,
and the cash or other proceeds realized from the sale, transfer,  disposition or
conversion  thereof,  excluding,  however,  any  platforms,  wells,  facilities,
fixtures,  equipment or property  located on the Lease or the Contract  Area and
used  exclusively  in connection  with the  ownership,  use or  exploitation  of
acreage or depths not included  within the Lease or Contract  Area. The interest
of the Operator in and to the oil,  gas,  and other  minerals  produced  from or
attributable to the Lease when extracted and the accounts receivable accruing or
arising as the result of the sale  thereof  shall be financed at the wellhead of
the well or wells  located  on the Lease or the  Contract  Area.  To the  extent
permissible  under applicable law, the security interest granted by the Operator
hereunder covers:  (a) all  substitutions,  replacements,  and accessions to the
property of the  Operator  described  herein and is intended to cover all of the

all rights under any gas balancing  agreement,  farmout  rights,  option farmout
rights, acreage and cash contributions, and conversion rights of the Operator in

association,  joint venture, or other entity or enterprise to the extent that it
holds,  owns, or controls any interest in the Contract Area; and (c) all rights,
claims,  general  intangibles,  and proceeds,  whether now existing or hereafter
acquired or arising,  in and to the contracts,  agreements,  permits,  licenses,
rights-of-way,  and  similar  rights  and  privileges  that  relate  to  or  are
appurtenant to the Lease or the Contract Area, including the following:

(1)   all of its rights,  titles, and interests,  whether now owned and existing
or hereafter acquired or arising,  in, to, and under or derived from any present
or future operating, farmout, bidding, pooling, unitization, and communitization
agreements,  assignments,  and subleases, whether or not described in Attachment
"1", to the extent, and only to the extent,  that such agreements,  assignments,

that relate to or are appurtenant to the Lease or the Contract Area.

              Obligations  and  Indebtedness  of the  Operator  Secured.  To the
extent  permissible  under  applicable  law,  the liens and  security  interests
granted by the Operator in this  Agreement  shall secure (a) the  performance of
and  payment  by  the  Operator  to  each  of  the  Non-Operators  of all of its
obligations and indebtedness,  whether now owed or hereafter arising pursuant to

              Priority;  Successors.  Each Party  represents and warrants to the
other Parties hereto that the lien and security  interest  granted by such Party
to the other Parties shall be a first and prior lien and security interest,  and
each Party  hereby  agrees to maintain  the  priority of said lien and  security
interest against all persons  acquiring an interest in the Lease or the Contract
Area by, through or under such Party.  All Parties  acquiring an interest in the
Lease or the Contract Area, whether by assignment,  merger, mortgage,  operation
of law,  or  otherwise,  shall be deemed to have  taken  subject to the lien and
security interest hereunder as to all obligations  attributable to such interest
hereunder whether or not such obligations arise before or after such interest is
acquired.

              Waiver.  If any  Party  does not  perform  all of its  obligations
hereunder,  and the failure to perform  subjects  such Party to  foreclosure  or
execution  proceedings  pursuant to the  provisions  of this  Agreement,  to the
extent allowed by governing law, the defaulting Party waives any available right
of redemption  from and after the date of judgment,  and any available  right to
require a marshaling of assets.

              Other Lien Rights.  Each Party agrees that the other Parties shall
be entitled to utilize the  provisions of oil and gas lien law or other lien law
of any state adjacent to the Contract Area, or that is otherwise applicable,  to
enforce  the  obligations  and  indebtedness  of each Party  hereunder.  Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing,  to the extent permitted by applicable
law,  each of the  Non-Operators  agree that the Operator may invoice or utilize
the mechanics' or  materialmen's  lien law of the state adjacent to the Contract
Area,  or that is  otherwise  applicable,  in order to secure the payment to the
Operator of any sum due hereunder for services  performed or materials  supplied
by the Operator.

              Power of Sale.  To the extent  permitted by  applicable  law, each
Party hereby grants to the other Parties a power of sale ("Power of Sale") as to
any property that is subject to the lien and security rights granted  hereunder,
such  power to be  exercised  in the  manner  provided  by  these  Power of Sale
provisions  and in the manner  provided  by  applicable  law or  otherwise  in a
commercially reasonable manner and upon reasonable notice,  including reasonable
notice of intent to  foreclose  said lien or security  right by exercise of such
Power of Sale of not less than thirty (30) days.  Subject to the  provisions  of
this  Agreement,  if a Party  should  elect to  foreclose  the lien (the "Lien")
granted to such Party  (the  "Foreclosing  Party")  pursuant  to this  Agreement
against the interests in the leasehold  estate of the Lease or any future leases
comprising  the Contract  Area ("Real  Property  Interest")  of a Party that has
failed to pay any liquidated and undisputed  portion of its payment  obligations
hereunder (the "Defaulting  Party"), the Parties hereby authorize a non-judicial
sale under the laws of the State of Louisiana. The Foreclosing Party's Corporate
Secretary is hereby  appointed as Trustee for such purpose  (whether the Trustee
named herein or appointed as a substitute or successor  Trustee  pursuant to the
terms of this  Agreement,  the "Trustee").  The Foreclosing  Party may appoint a
substitute or successor  Trustee in the event the Trustee above named resigns or
is unable for any reason to serve, or if the  Foreclosing  Party should elect at
any time (with or without cause) to remove the Trustee.  Upon such default,  and
upon  request by the  Foreclosing  Party to the  Trustee to  foreclose  the Lien
pursuant to this Power of Sale, the Trustee shall, at least twenty-one (21) days
preceding the date of  non-judicial  sale,  serve written notice of the proposed
sale by certified mail on the Defaulting  Party  according to the records of the
Foreclosing  Party.  Service of such notice shall be deemed  completed  upon the
deposit in a post office or other official depository under the care and custody
of the United  States  Postal  Service of such  notice  enclosed  in a post-paid
wrapper


                                       106
<PAGE>

properly  addressed  to the  Defaulting  Party,  together  with each other Party
obligated to pay the obligations secured by the Lien, at the most recent address
or addresses shown on the records of the Foreclosing Party. The affidavit of any
person  having  knowledge  of the  facts to the  effect  that such  service  was
completed  shall be prima facie  evidence  of the facts of  service.  After such
notice,  the Trustee shall proceed to sell all of the Real Property  Interest of
the  Defaulting  Party in the  Contract  Area at public  auction to the  highest
bidder for cash after  having  given notice of the time and place of sale and in
the manner and after the  advertisement of such sale as required by the statutes
of the State of  Louisiana  in making sales of real estate under deeds of trust.
Sale of a part of the Defaulting  Party's Real Property Interest in the Contract
Area shall not exhaust the Power of Sale, and subsequent  sales may be made from
time to time until all of such Real Property Interest is sold or the obligations
of the Defaulting  Party secured by the Lien are paid in full. The Trustee shall
have  the  authority  to  appoint  an  attorney  in  fact to act as  Trustee  in
conducting the foreclosure  sale and executing a deed to the  purchasers.  It is
further agreed that the Trustee may sell the full Real Property  Interest of the
Defaulting Party in the Contract Area or may limit such sale to such portions of
the Real Property  Interest of the Defaulting  Party in the Contract Area as the
Trustee shall deem expedient.  After the completion of any sale pursuant hereto,
the Trustee shall make,  execute,  and deliver to the purchaser or purchasers of
the Real Property Interest of the Defaulting Party in the Contract Area good and
sufficient  deeds,  assignments,  or other  lawful  conveyances  to vest in such
purchaser  or  purchasers  title to such Real  Property  Interest  in fee simple
together with all personal property used or obtained in connection therewith and
together  with all of the  proceeds  of  production  attributable  thereto on or
subsequent to the effective  date of such sale.  From the proceeds of such sale,
the Trustee shall make disbursements in the following order:

(a)   pay all charges, costs, and expenses of executing these provisions;

(b)   pay any sums due and paid by the Trustee for taxes in the  preservation of
the security;

(c)   pay to the  Foreclosing  Party up to the amount  necessary  to satisfy the
Defaulting Party's obligations and indebtedness hereunder; and

(d)   the balance, if any, shall be paid to the Defaulting Party.

      It is  agreed  that  such  sale  shall  be a  perpetual  bar  against  the
Defaulting Party and its heirs, successors, assigns, legal representatives,  and
all other persons claiming under him, them, or any of them. It is further agreed
that the Trustee,  or any holder or holders of the  obligation of the Defaulting
Party, or the Foreclosing  Party shall have the right to become the purchaser or
purchasers at such sale if such Party is the highest bidder or bidders, in which
event the bid or bids may be credited upon the  indebtedness  of the  Defaulting
Party.  It is  stipulated  and agreed  that,  in case of any sale  hereunder  by
Trustee or its successor,  all  prerequisites  of such sale shall be presumed to
have been  performed;  and any conveyance  given hereunder and all statements of
fact or recitals therein made as to (a) the nonpayment of money secured, (b) any
default under the terms hereof,  (c) the request by the Foreclosing Party to the
Trustee  to  foreclose  the Lien,  (d) the  proper  and due  appointment  of any
successor or substitute  Trustee,  (e) the  advertisement of sale, (f) the time,
place,  and terms of sale,  or (g) any other  preliminary  act or thing shall be
taken in all courts of law and equity as prima facie  evidence that the facts so
stated  are true.  If the  Foreclosing  Party  consists  of more than one Party,
actions and directions of the Foreclosing


                                       107
<PAGE>

Party under this Power of Sale shall  require  the  approval of the holders of a
majority in amount of the Defaulting  Party's  liquidated and undisputed payment
obligations which are then due.

5.0   This Memorandum is to be filed or recorded, as the case may be, in (a) the
conveyance  records of the parish or parishes  adjacent to the  offshore  blocks
covered by the Lease or contained  within the Contract Area pursuant to La. R.S.
9:2731 et seq., (b) the mortgage  records or other  appropriate  records of such
parish or parishes,  and (c) the appropriate  Louisiana Commercial  Laws-Secured
Transactions  records.  This Memorandum  (including a carbon,  photographic,  or
other  reproduction  thereof and hereof) shall constitute a non-standard form of
financing  statement  under  the  terms  of  Louisiana  Commercial  Laws-Secured
Transactions and, as such, for the purposes of the security interest in favor of
the Operator, may be filed for record in the office of the Secretary of State of
the  State of  Louisiana,  with the  Operator  being the  secured  party and the
Non-Operator  being the debtor with respect to such filing.  For the purposes of
the security interest in favor of the Non-Operator, this Memorandum (including a
carbon, photographic,  or other reproduction thereof and hereof) may be filed in
such office as a non-standard form of financing statement with the  Non-Operator
being the secured  party and the Operator  being the debtor with respect to such
filing.  With  respect to such filing as a  financing  statement,  the  security
interests  created  in the  Operating  Agreement  cover  minerals  or  the  like

have the right to file a continuation statement pursuant to Louisiana Commercial
Laws-Secured Transactions with respect to any financing statement filed in their
favor under the terms of this Memorandum.

8.0   It is understood and agreed by the Parties hereto that if any part,  term,
or  provision  of this  Memorandum  is held by the  courts to be  illegal  or in
conflict  with any law of the state where made,  the  validity of the  remaining
portions or provisions shall not be affected,  and the rights and obligations of
the Parties shall be construed and enforced as if the Memorandum did not contain

                                   EXHIBIT "G"

    Attached to and made a part of that certain Offshore Operating Agreement
   dated June 1, 2004, by and between BHP Billiton Petroleum (Americas) Inc.,
  Dominion Exploration & Production, Inc., The Houston Exploration Company and
                          Ridgewood Energy Corporation

                          DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURE

I.    OVERVIEW

      A.      Description  and Goals. Arbitration as used in this statement is a
procedure  whereby an  Arbitrator  resolves any  claim(s),  controversy(ies)  or
dispute(s) (the "Dispute")  between or among BHP Billiton  Petroleum  (Americas)
Inc., Dominion  Exploration & Production,  Inc., The Houston Exploration Company
and Ridgewood Energy Corporation  (hereinafter referred to singularly as "Party"
and collectively as "Parties") arising out of, relating to or in connection with
the Offshore  Operating  Agreement dated effective April 14, 2004,  (hereinafter
"Agreement")  including  the  interpretation,  validity,  termination  or breach
thereof.

      (i)     Binding:  The  arbitration  process is  binding on the Parties and
this arbitration is intended to be a final resolution of any Dispute between the
Parties as described above, to the same extent as a final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction.  Each Party hereby expressly covenants that it shall not
resort to court remedies except as provided for herein or for preliminary relief
in aid of arbitration.

      (ii)    Violation:  Notwithstanding   Sections II. F  and  II.  K  (i),  a
non-prevailing  Party shall pay all legal (including  attorneys' fees) and court
costs incurred by the other Party directly in connection with the enforcement of
the final  resolution  of any Dispute under this Dispute  Resolution  Procedure.
Suits,  actions or  proceedings  in connection  with such  enforcement  shall be
instituted in an appropriate  court of Law in Houston,  Texas. Each Party waives
any  objections  to the  venue  of any  such  suit,  action  or  proceeding  and
irrevocably  submits to the jurisdiction of such court in any such suit,  action
or proceeding.

      B.      Duty to  Negotiate: The Parties  shall inform one another promptly
following  the  occurrence  or  discovery  of any  item  or  event  which  might
reasonably be expected to result in a


                                       120
<PAGE>

Dispute in connection  with the  Agreement.  The Parties will attempt to resolve
satisfactorily any such matters.

      C.      Notice of Unresolved  Dispute:  Should a Dispute  arise  which the
Parties  cannot  resolve  satisfactorily,  either Party may deliver to the other
Party a written notice of the Dispute with  supporting  documentation  as to the
circumstances  leading to the Dispute  (the "Notice of  Dispute").  The Parties,
within ten (10)  Business  Days from  delivery of such  notice,  shall then each
appoint a management  representative  ("Management  Representative")  who has no
prior direct involvement with the subject matter of the Notice of Dispute who is
duly authorized to investigate, negotiate and settle the Dispute. The Management
Representative  for each  Party  shall  meet and  confer  as often as they  deem
reasonably  necessary for a period not exceeding  thirty (30) days following the
appointment  of the  management  representative  in good faith  negotiations  to
resolve the Dispute  amicably.  The Parties,  in their sole  discretion may also
mutually  agree  to  utilize  the  service  of a  mediator  pursuant  to a joint
engagement.  Unless otherwise  provided herein, all such notices shall be served
in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement.

II.   ARBITRATION PROCESS

      A.      Arbitration:  If the  Parties  are unable to resolve  the  Dispute
within sixty (60) days  following the receipt of the Notice of Dispute,  or such
additional  time as may be mutually  agreed,  the matter  shall be  submitted to
arbitration in accordance with the procedures set forth below.

      B.      Initiation of Arbitration: The  arbitration  shall be initiated by
either Party delivering to the other a Notice of Intention to Arbitrate.

      C.      Governing Procedures:  Except as expressly  provided  herein,  the
arbitration  shall be conducted in accordance  with procedures that are mutually
acceptable to the Parties, including limited deposition-less discovery. However,
if the Parties cannot agree, then discovery shall be conducted  according to the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

      (i)     Governing   Law:  The   Arbitrator   shall  apply   the  governing
substantive law of the state chosen by the Parties to the Agreement.

      D.      Arbitrator:   There  shall  be  one  Arbitrator,   who   shall  be
independent,   impartial  and  experienced  in  arbitration   proceedings.   The
Arbitrator shall be experienced in the oil and gas industry and knowledgeable or
specializing  as to the subject matter  involved in the Dispute.  The Arbitrator
shall not be a present or former employee,  director,  officer, or consultant of
any of the


                                       121
<PAGE>

Parties or their predecessors  herein. The arbitrator selected shall be either a
licensed  attorney or a former judge. The Arbitrator shall be chosen as follows:

the  Parties  shall  have  thirty  (30)  days from the  delivery  of a Notice of
Intention to Arbitrate to mutually agree on an Arbitrator. If the Parties cannot
mutually  agree  within said thirty  (30) day  period,  then the Parties  shall,
within (3) days after  expiration  of the thirty (30) day  period,  apply to the
American Arbitration  Association ("AAA") as the Appointing  Authority,  for the
appointment of an Arbitrator  for or on behalf of the Parties,  and in such case
the Arbitrator appointed by the Appointing Authority shall meet the criteria set
in this Section II.D and shall act as if mutually agreed to by the Parties.

      (i)     Conflicts: Any Arbitrator, prior to his or her appointment,  shall
disclose to the  Parties  all actual or  perceived  conflicts  of  interest  and
business relationships  involving the Dispute or the Parties,  including but not
limited to, any professional or social relationships,  present or past, with any
Party (or its affiliates),  including any Party's (or its affiliates) directors,
officers  and  supervisory  personnel  and counsel.  Any Party may  challenge in
writing the  appointment  or  continued  service of any  Arbitrator  for lack of
independence,  partiality or any other cause likely to impair such  Arbitrator's
ability  to  effectively  participate  in the  proceedings  or render a fair and
equitable decision. Where such challenge is made, the Appointing Authority shall
uphold or  dismiss  the  challenge.  In the event a  challenge  is  upheld,  the
Arbitrator shall be replaced.  A replacement will be selected in the same manner
as the original  Arbitrator  was selected.  If an Arbitrator  resigns or becomes
unable or unwilling to continue to serve as the Arbitrator,  a replacement shall
be selected in the same manner as that Arbitrator was chosen.  Except for acting
as the  Appointing  Authority,  as  contemplated  in  Section  II.D and  Section
II.D(i),   the  AAA  shall  have  no  further  involvement  in  the  arbitration
proceeding,  including without limitation administering the arbitration,  unless
agreed to in writing by the Parties.

      (ii)    Multi-Party Arbitrations: Where more than two Parties are involved
in the Dispute ("Multi-Party  Arbitration"),  all Parties shall jointly name and
agree as the  appointment  of the  Arbitrator  meeting the criteria set forth in
Section  D.D.  above.  If the  Parties  cannot  agree  as to the  choice  of the
Arbitrator  within the said thirty (30) days,  any of the Parties  hereto may in
like manner,  within three (3) business days after  written  notice to the other
Parties,  apply to the Appointing Authority for the appointment of an Arbitrator
meeting the criteria set forth in Section II.D. above.


                                       122
<PAGE>

      (iii)   Management  of  the  Arbitration:  The Arbitrator  shall  actively
manage  the  proceedings  as he or  she  deems  best  so as  to  make  the  same
expeditious, economical and less burdensome and adversarial than litigation.

      E.      Confidentiality: All documents, briefs, testimony, transcripts, as
well as all Arbitrator  decisions shall be  confidential.  likewise,  the views,
suggestions,  admissions, proposals and other information exchanged or disclosed
in  the  arbitration  are   confidential  and  are  inadmissible  in  any  other
proceeding.

      F.      Costs and Expenses:  Except as set forth in Section I.A(ii) above,
(i) the Parties  involved in the dispute  shall be equally  responsible  for all
costs,  fees and expenses  incurred by the Arbitrator  and any other  incidental
costs incurred in connection with the arbitration proceeding shall also be borne
equally  by the  Parties;  (ii)  each  Party is solely  responsible  for its own
attorneys' fees and expenses incurred in the Arbitration; and (iii) in the event
of a Multi-Party  Arbitration,  all costs and expenses shall be borne equally by
all Parties.

      G.      Submissions: Within thirty  (30) days after the  selection  of the
Arbitrator,  each Party  shall  provide  the  Arbitrator  with a short and plain
submission  defining  the issues to be decided and the nature of the relief that
the Arbitrator may award (the  "Submission").  This Submission  shall explicitly
authorize the Arbitrators to decide these issues.  This authorization shall stay
in force for period no longer than nine (9) months from this Submission.  If the
Parties are unable to reach consensus as to the issues involved,  the Arbitrator
in his or her sole  discretion  shall  frame the  issues  through  a  reasonable
procedure.   The  Arbitrator  will  render  decisions  on  the  specific  issues
established and shall fashion any remedy that the Arbitrator  deems  appropriate
so long as that remedy is consistent  with the Parties1  Submissions  hereunder.
Any money judgment entered by the Arbitrator shall be payable in U.S. dollars.

      H.      Transcriptions: The presentations and argument will be transcribed
for the benefit of the  Arbitrator  and the Parties.

      I.      Discovery:  Commencing thirty  (30) days after the  receipt of the
opposing  Party's  Submission,  each Party may serve upon the other  Party up to
twenty (20) requests for the production of documents,  including  subparts.  The
requests  shall be made in good faith and not be served for the purpose of delay
or  harassment.  Each request shall  describe the type of documents)  sought and
each  request  shall be limited to  documents  that are  relevant  to a claim or
defense in the Arbitration  proceeding,  or reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence


                                       123
<PAGE>

under the Federal Rules of Evidence. The requests need not be served all at once
but may be served in stages.

      (i)     The Party served with a request under this provision shall provide
the adverse  Party with copies of the  requested  documents,  and  identify  the
request to which each  document is  responsive,  within  thirty (30) days of the
receipt  of the  request.  If the Party  served  with a request  objects  to the
production  of any of the requested  documents,  it shall  nevertheless  produce
within the permitted  time all  documents  responsive to any request that is not
objected to by that Party.

      (ii)    A Party that is  served with a request may challenge the propriety
of the  request  within  the time  permitted  for  response  by a short  written
objection  which shall be forwarded to the adverse Party and to the  Arbitrator.
The adverse Party shall submit its response,  if any, to the objecting Party and
the Arbitrator within five (5) days of receipt of the objection.  The Arbitrator
shall consider the request,  the objection and the response,  if any, and decide
whether the production  shall be allowed or denied or whether the request should
be modified  within ten (10) days after the  submission  of the adverse  Party's
response.

      J.      Presentations:  No later than  twenty-five  (25) days prior to the
date that  presentations to the Arbitrator are to begin,  each Party will submit
to the Arbitrator and serve on the other Party a written position statement. The
original  statement of each Party shall not exceed  thirty-five (35) typewritten
letter-size  pages with no less than one inch  margins and no less than 12 pitch
font size for all text (including footnotes). Each Party shall have the right to
submit reply statements no later than fifteen (15) days prior to the date of the
presentation.  Such reply  statements  shall not exceed fifteen (15) typewritten
letter-size  pages and shall conform to the  formatting  requirements  set forth
above in this Section.

      (i)     All  documents and  affidavits  that a Party intends to use during
its  presentation  shall be submitted to the  Arbitrator and served on the other
Party with the position and reply statements.  All demonstrative  exhibits shall
be exchanged five (5) days in advance of the presentations.

      (ii)    The presentations to the Arbitrator shall extend for such time as
the Arbitrator  agrees to be appropriate.  In the absence of any agreement,  the
presentations  for both Parties shall extend for no longer than two (2) days and
shall be  concluded  within six (6) months after  selection  of the  Arbitrator.
Presentations of each Party shall occur successively with no intervening delay.

      (iii)   Each Party shall make  an oral and/or  documentary presentation of
its position in such order and in accordance with the time schedule  established
by the Arbitrator.  The Arbitrator may question each of the presenters during or
following any and all presentations.


                                       124
<PAGE>

      The Arbitrator shall determine a reasonable time and location for the
presentations.

      K.      Decision and Award:  The Arbitrator shall  promptly  (within sixty
(60)  days of  conclusion  of the  presentations  or such  longer  period as the
Parties may  mutually  agree)  determine  the claims of the Parties and render a
final  decision in  writing.  The  decision  shall  state with  specificity  the
findings of fact and conclusions of law on which it rests [unless the arbitrator
is required to be an attorney,  it is not  reasonable to require a non-lawyer to
follow such a format].  The decision  rendered by the Arbitrator may be enforced
in accordance with Section I.A. (ii),  above, and may only be appealed  pursuant
to Section L below.  The  decision  shall be served  upon each of the Parties by
facsimile transmission and by first class mail.

      (i)     If applicable law allows pre-award  interest,  the Arbitrator may,
in his or her discretion, grant pre-award interest and, if so, such interest may
be at  commercial  rates in the state chosen by the Parties  pursuant to Section
n.C.(i) during the relevant period.  Each Party shall be responsible for its own
attorney's  fees and  costs of  arbitration.  The  Arbitrator  shall  not  award
consequential, punitive, indirect or other non-compensatory damages.

      (ii)    Within  ten (10) days  of  receipt  of the award  either  side may
submit a Motion to Modify the award. A response shall be due within fifteen (15)
days  thereafter and the Arbitrator  shall rule thereon within fifteen (15) days
after receipt of the response.

      (iii)   Judgment on the award  may be entered in  an appropriate  court of
law in Houston, Texas at any time within one year after the decision is made.

      L.      Vacation of Award and Appeal:  An appeal from an order or judgment
pursuant to this Section II.L.  shall be instituted in an  appropriate  court of
Law in  Houston,  Texas.  The court may  vacate  the award only if the award was
procured  by or through  fraud or  corruption.  Each Party  waives any option or
objection  which it may now or thereafter have to the laying of the venue of any
such suit,  action or proceeding and irrevocably  submits to the jurisdiction of
the court in any such  suit,  action or  proceeding.  Each Party  agrees  that a
remedy at law for a  violation of this  Section  II.L. may not be  adequate  and
therefore agrees that the remedies of specific performance and injunctive relief
shall be available in the event of any  violation in addition to any other right
or remedy at law or in equity to which any Party may be entitled.

      M.      Res Judicata:  To the extent permitted by law, any decision of the
Arbitrator  shall not be  res judicata or have any  binding  effect in any other
litigation or arbitration where any Party to this Agreement may also be a party.

         Security Rights; Default; Unpaid Charges; Carved-out Interests.

8.6   Security Rights (Louisiana).

In  addition  to any other  security  rights and  remedies  provided by law with
respect to services  rendered or materials  and equipment  furnished  under this
Agreement,  for and in consideration of the covenants and mutual undertakings of
the Operator and the Non-operators  herein, the Parties shall have the following
security rights:

8.6.1 Mortgage in Favor of the Operator.

Each  Non-operator  hereby grants to the Operator a mortgage,  hypothecate,  and
pledge of and over all of its rights,  titles,  and  interests in and to (a) the
Lease,  (b) the  Hydrocarbons  in, on, under,  and that may be produced from the
lands within the Contract Area, and (c) all other immovable property susceptible
of mortgage  situated within the Contract Area.

This  mortgage is given to secure the  complete  and timely  performance  of and
payment by each  Non-operator of all obligations and  indebtedness of every kind
and nature, whether now owed by such Non-operator or hereafter arising, pursuant
to this Agreement. To the extent susceptible under applicable law, this mortgage
and the security  interests granted in favor of the Operator herein shall secure
the  payment of all costs and other  expenses  properly  charged to such  Party,
together with (A) interest on such  indebtedness,  costs,  and other expenses at
the rate set forth in Exhibit "C" (the  "Accounting  Procedure")  or the maximum
rate allowed by law,  whichever is the lesser,  (B) reasonable  attorneys' fees,
(C) court  costs,  and (D)  other  directly  related  collection  costs.  If any
Non-operator  does  not pay  such  costs  and  other  expenses  or  perform  its
obligations  under  this  Agreement  when  due,  the  Operator  shall  have  the
additional  right to  notify  the  purchaser  or  purchasers  of the  defaulting
Non-operator's  Hydrocarbon production and collect such costs and other expenses
out of the proceeds from the sale of the defaulting Non-operator's


                                       126
<PAGE>

share of  Hydrocarbon  production  until  the  amount  owed has been  paid.  The
Operator  shall have the right to offset the amount owed  against  the  proceeds
from the sale of such defaulting Non-operator's share of Hydrocarbon production.
Any  purchaser of such  production  shall be entitled to rely on the  Operator's
statement  concerning  the  amount  of  costs  and  other  expenses  owed by the
defaulting  Non-operator and payment made to the Operator by any purchaser shall
be  binding  and  conclusive  as  between  such  purchaser  and such  defaulting
Non-operator.

The maximum amount for which the mortgage  herein  granted by each  Non-operator
shall be deemed to secure the obligations and indebtedness of such  Non-operator
to the  Operator  as  stipulated  herein is hereby  fixed in an amount  equal to
$25,000,000.00  (the "Limit of the  Mortgage of each  Non-operator").  Except as
provided in the previous  sentence (and then only to the extent such limitations
are required by law), the entire amount of obligations and  indebtedness of each
Non-operator   to  the   Operator   is  secured   hereby   without   limitation.
Notwithstanding  the foregoing Limit of the Mortgage of each  Non-operator,  the
liability  of each  Non-operator  under  this  Agreement  and the  mortgage  and
security interest granted hereby shall be limited to (and the Operator shall not
be  entitled  to enforce  the same  against  such  Non-operator  for,  an amount
exceeding)  the actual  obligations  and  indebtedness  [including  all interest
charges,  costs,  attorneys'  fees,  and  other  charges  provided  for in  this
Agreement or in the  Memorandum of Operating  Agreement and Financing  Statement
(Louisiana),  as such term is defined in Article 8.6.1.4  (Recordation)  hereof]
outstanding  and unpaid and that are  attributable  to or  charged  against  the
interest of such Non-operator pursuant to this Agreement.

8.6.1.1 Security Interest in Favor of the Operator.

To  secure  the  complete  and  timely   performance  of  and  payment  by  each
Non-operator  of all  obligations  and  indebtedness  of every kind and  nature,
whether now owed by such  Non-operator  or hereafter  arising,  pursuant to this
Agreement, each Non-operator hereby grants to the Operator a continuing security
interest  in  and  to all of its  rights,  titles,  interests,  claims,  general
intangibles,  proceeds, and products thereof,  whether now existing or hereafter
acquired,  in and to (a) all  Hydrocarbons  produced  from the lands or offshore
blocks  covered by the Lease or Contract Area  attributable  to the Lease or the
Contract Area when produced,  (b) all accounts receivable accruing or arising as
a  result  of the  sale of such  Hydrocarbons  (including,  without  limitation,
accounts  arising from gas  imbalances or from the sale of  Hydrocarbons  at the
wellhead),  (c) all cash or other  proceeds  from the sale of such  Hydrocarbons
once  produced,  and  (d)  all  Platforms  and  Development  Facilities,  wells,
fixtures, other corporeal property, whether


                                       127
<PAGE>

movable or immovable,  whether now or hereafter  placed on the lands or offshore
blocks  covered  by the  Lease or the  Contract  Area or  maintained  or used in
connection with the ownership,  use or exploitation of the Lease or the Contract
Area,  and other  surface and  sub-surface  equipment  of any kind or  character
located on or  attributable  to the Lease or the  Contract  Area and the cash or
other  proceeds  realized  from the sale,  transfer,  disposition  or conversion
thereof.  The interest of the  Non-operators  in and to the oil and gas produced
from or  attributable  to the Lease when  extracted and the accounts  receivable
accruing or arising as the result of the sale  thereof  shall be financed at the
wellhead of the well or wells located on the Lease or the Contract  Area. To the
extent  susceptible  under applicable law, the security interest granted by each
Non-operator  hereunder  covers:  (A)  all  substitutions,   replacements,   and
accessions to the property of such Non-operator described herein and is intended
to cover all of the rights,  titles and  interests of such  Non-operator  in all
movable  property now or hereafter  located upon or used in connection  with the
Contract Area,  whether  corporeal or incorporeal;  (B) all rights under any gas
balancing  agreement,  farmout rights,  option farmout rights,  acreage and cash
contributions, and conversion rights of such Non-operator in connection with the
Lease or the Contract Area, or the Hydrocarbons produced from or attributable to
the Lease or the  Contract  Area,  whether now owned and  existing or  hereafter
acquired  or arising,  including,  without  limitation,  all  interests  of each
Non-operator  in  any  partnership,   tax  partnership,   limited   partnership,
association,  joint venture,  or other entity or enterprise that holds, owns, or
controls any interest in the Contract Area; and (C) all rights,  claims, general
intangibles,  and proceeds,  whether now existing or hereafter acquired, of each
Non-operator   in  and  to  the  contracts,   agreements,   permits,   licenses,
rights-of-way,  and  similar  rights  and  privileges  that  relate  to  or  are
appurtenant to the Lease or the Contract Area, including the following:

1)    all of its rights,  titles, and interests,  whether now owned and existing
or hereafter acquired or arising,  in, to, and under or derived from any present
or future operating, farmout, bidding, pooling, unitization, and communitization
agreements,  assignments, and subleases, described in Exhibit "A" to the extent,
and only to the extent, that such agreements,  assignments,  and subleases cover
or include  any of its  rights,  titles,  and  interests,  whether now owned and
existing or hereafter  acquired or arising,  in and to all or any portion of the
Lease  or the  Contract  Area,  and  all  units  created  by any  such  pooling,
unitization,  and communitization  agreements and all units formed under orders,
regulations, rules, or other official acts of any governmental


                                       128
<PAGE>

authority  having  jurisdiction,  to the extent and only to the extent that such
units cover or include all or any portion of the Lease or the Contract Area;

2)    all of its rights,  titles, and interests,  whether now owned and existing
or  hereafter  acquired  or  arising,  in,  to,  and under or  derived  from all
presently existing and future advance payment  agreements,  and oil,  casinghead
gas,  and  gas  sales,   exchange,  and  processing  contracts  and  agreements,
including, without limitation, those contracts and agreements that are described
on Exhibit  "A" to the  extent,  and only to the  extent,  those  contracts  and
agreements  cover or include  all or any  portion  of the Lease or the  Contract
Area; and

3)    all of its rights,  titles, and interests,  whether now owned and existing
or hereafter acquired or arising, in, to, and under or derived from all existing
and future permits, licenses,  rights-of-way,  and similar rights and privileges
that relate to or are appurtenant to the Lease or the Contract Area.

8.6.1.2 Mortgage in Favor of the Non-operators.

The Operator  hereby  grants to each  Non-operator  a mortgage,  hypotheca,  and
pledge of and over all of its rights,  titles,  and  interests in and to (a) the
Lease;  (b) the  Hydrocarbons  in, on,  under,  and that my be produced from the
lands within the Contract  Area; and (c) all other  immovable  property or other
property  susceptible  of  mortgage  situated  within the  Contract  Area.

This  mortgage is given to secure the  complete  and timely  performance  of and
payment by the Operator of all  obligations  and  indebtedness of every kind and
nature, whether now owed by the Operator or hereafter arising,  pursuant to this
Agreement. To the extent susceptible under applicable law, this mortgage and the
security interests granted in favor of each Non-operator herein shall secure the
payment  of all costs and  other  expenses  properly  charged  to the  Operator,
together with (A) interest on such  indebtedness,  costs,  and other expenses at
the rate set forth in Exhibit "C" or the maximum rate allowed by law,  whichever
is the lesser,  (B) reasonable  attorneys'  fees, (C) court costs, and (D) other
directly related  collection  costs. If the Operator does not pay such costs and
other  expenses or perform its  obligations  under this  Agreement when due, the
Non-operators  shall  have the  additional  right to  notify  the  purchaser  or
purchasers of the Operator's  Hydrocarbon  production and collect such costs and
other  expenses out of the  proceeds  from the sale of the  Operator's  share of
Hydrocarbon  production  until the amount owed has been paid. The  Non-operators
shall have the right to offset the amount  owed  against the  proceeds  from the
sale of the Operator's share of Hydrocarbon production. Any purchaser of


                                       129
<PAGE>

such  production  shall  be  entitled  to rely on the  Non-operators'  statement
concerning  the  amount of costs and other  expenses  owed by the  Operator  and
payment  made  to the  Non-operators  by any  purchaser  shall  be  binding  and
conclusive as between such  purchaser and the Operator.

The maximum  amount for which the mortgage  herein granted by the Operator shall
be deemed to secure the  obligations  and  indebtedness  of the  Operator to all
Non-operators  as  stipulated  herein  is  hereby  fixed in an  amount  equal to
$25,000,000.00  in the aggregate (the "Limit of the Mortgage of the  Operator").
Except as provided in the  previous  sentence  (and then only to the extent such
limitations  are  required  by  law),  the  entire  amount  of  obligations  and
indebtedness  of the Operator to the  Non-operators  is secured  hereby  without
limitation. Notwithstanding the foregoing Limit of the Mortgage of the Operator,
the liability of the Operator under this Agreement and the mortgage and security
interest granted hereby shall be limited to (and the Non-operators  shall not be
entitled to enforce the same against the Operator for, an amount  exceeding) the
actual  obligations and  indebtedness  [including all interest  charges,  costs,
attorneys'  fees,  and other  charges  provided for in this  Agreement or in the
Memorandum of Operating Agreement and Financing Statement  (Louisiana),  as such
term is defined in Article 8.6.1.4  hereof]  outstanding and unpaid and that are
attributable to or charged against the interest of the Operator pursuant to this
Agreement.

8.6.1.3 Security Interest in Favor of the Non-operators.

To secure the complete and timely  performance of and payment by the Operator of
all obligations and  indebtedness of every kind and nature,  whether now owed by
the  Operator or hereafter  arising,  pursuant to this  Agreement,  the Operator
hereby grants to each Non-operator a continuing  security interest in and to all
of its rights, titles,  interests,  claims,  general intangibles,  proceeds, and
products thereof,  whether now existing or hereafter acquired, in and to (a) all
Hydrocarbons  produced from the lands or offshore blocks covered by the Lease or
included  within the Contract Area or attributable to the Lease or Contract Area
when produced,  (b) all accounts  receivable  accruing or arising as a result of
the sale of such Hydrocarbons (including,  without limitation,  accounts arising
from gas imbalances or from the sale of Hydrocarbons  at the wellhead),  (c) all
cash or other proceeds from the sale of such Hydrocarbons once produced, and (d)
all Platforms and  Development  Facilities,  wells,  fixtures,  other  corporeal
property  whether movable or immovable,  whether now or hereafter  placed on the
offshore  blocks covered by the Lease or the Contract Area or maintained or used
in  connection  with the  ownership,  use or  exploitation  of the  Lease or the
Contract Area, and other surface and sub-surface equipment of


                                       130
<PAGE>

any kind or character  located on or  attributable  to the Lease or the Contract
Area  and  the  cash  or  other  proceeds  realized  from  the  sale,  transfer,
disposition  or conversion  thereof.  The interest of the Operator in and to the
Hydrocarbons  produced  from or  attributable  to the Lease or the Contract Area
when extracted and the accounts  receivable accruing or arising as the result of
the sale thereof  shall be financed at the wellhead of the well or wells located
on the Lease or the Contract Area. To the extent  susceptible  under  applicable
law, the security  interest granted by the Operator  hereunder  covers:  (A) all
substitutions,  replacements,  and  accessions  to the  property of the Operator
described  herein  and is  intended  to  cover  all of the  rights,  titles  and
interests of the Operator in all movable property now or hereafter  located upon
or used in connection with the Lease or the Contract Area,  whether corporeal or
incorporeal;  (B) all rights under any gas balancing agreement,  farmout rights,
option farmout rights, acreage and cash contributions,  and conversion rights of
the Operator in connection with the Lease or the Contract Area, the Hydrocarbons
produced from or  attributable  to the Lease or the Contract  Area,  whether now
owned  and  existing  or  hereafter  acquired  or  arising,  including,  without
limitation,  all interests of the Operator in any partnership,  tax partnership,
limited partnership,  association,  joint venture, or other entity or enterprise
that holds,  owns,  or controls any interest in the Lease or the Contract  Area;
and (C) all rights,  claims,  general  intangibles,  and  proceeds,  whether now
existing  or  hereafter  acquired,  of the  Operator  in  and to the  contracts,
agreements, permits, licenses,  rights-of-way, and similar rights and privileges
that relate to or are  appurtenant to the Lease or the Contract Area,  including
the following:

(a)   all of its rights,  titles, and interests,  whether now owned and existing
or hereafter acquired or arising,  in, to, and under or derived from any present
or future operating, farmout, bidding, pooling, unitization, and communitization
agreements,  assignments, and subleases, whether or not described in Exhibit "A"
or Exhibit "A-l" to the extent,  and only to the extent,  that such  agreements,
assignments,  and  subleases  cover or include  any of its rights,  titles,  and
interests,  whether now owned and existing or hereafter acquired or arising,  in
and to all or any  portion  of the  Lease or the  Contract  Area,  and all units
created by any such pooling, unitization, and communitization agreements and all
units formed under orders,  regulations,  rules,  or other  official acts of any
governmental authority having jurisdiction, to the extent and only to the extent
that such units cover or include all or any portion of the Lease or the Contract
Area;

(b)   all of its rights,  titles, and interests,  whether now owned and existing
or  hereafter  acquired  or  arising,  in,  to,  and under or  derived  from all
presently existing and future advance


                                       131
<PAGE>

payment  agreements,  and oil,  casinghead  gas,  and gas sales,  exchange,  and
Development  contracts and  agreements,  including,  without  limitation,  those
contracts and  agreements  that are described on Exhibit "A" or Exhibit "A-l" to
the extent,  and only to the extent,  those  contracts and  agreements  cover or
include all or any portion of the Lease or the Contract Area; and

(c)   all of its rights,  titles, and interests,  whether now owned and existing
or hereafter acquired or arising, in, to, and under or derived from all existing
and future permits, licenses,  rights-of-way,  and similar rights and privileges
that relate to or are appurtenant to any of the Lease or the Contract Area.

8.6.1.4 Recordation.

To provide  evidence  of, and to further  perfect the Parties'  security  rights
created  hereunder,  upon request,  each Party shall execute and acknowledge the
Memorandum of Operating Agreement and Financing Statement  (Louisiana)  attached
as Exhibit "F" (the "Memorandum of Operating  Agreement and Financing  Statement
(Louisiana)) in multiple counterparts as appropriate.  The Parties authorize the
Operator to file the Memorandum of Operating  Agreement and Financing  Statement
(Louisiana)  in the  public  records  set forth  below to serve as notice of the
existence  of this  Agreement  as a burden on the title of the  Operator and the
Non-operators  to their  interests  in the Lease and the  Contract  Area and for
purposes of satisfying  otherwise relevant recording and filing  requirements of
applicable  law  and to  attach  an  original  of the  Memorandum  of  Operating
Agreement  and  Financing  Statement  (Louisiana)  to a  standard  UCC-1 (or the
equivalent as provided under Louisiana Revised  Statutes) in mutually  agreeable
forms  for  filing in the UCC  records  (or the  equivalent  as  provided  under
Louisiana  Revised  Statutes) set forth below to perfect the security  interests
created by the Parties in this  Agreement.  Upon the  acquisition of a leasehold
interest  in the Lease or the  Contract  Area,  the Parties  shall,  within five
business  days  following  request by one of the  Parties  hereto,  execute  and
furnish to the requesting  Party for recordation  such a Memorandum of Operating
Agreement  and  Financing  Statement   (Louisiana)   describing  such  leasehold
interest.  Such  Memorandum  of  Operating  Agreement  and  Financing  Statement
(Louisiana)  shall be amended from time to time upon  acquisition  of additional
leasehold  interests in the Lease or the Contract  Area,  and the Parties shall,
within  five  business  days  following  request by one of the  Parties  hereto,
execute and furnish to the requesting  Party for recordation any such amendment.

The Memorandum of Operating Agreement and Financing Statement  (Louisiana) is to
be filed or recorded,  as the case may be, in (a) the conveyance  records of the
parish or parishes adjacent to


                                       132
<PAGE>

the lands or  offshore  blocks  covered  by the Lease or  contained  within  the
Contract Area pursuant to La. R.S.  9:2731 et seq., (b) the mortgage  records of
such parish or parishes, and (c) the appropriate Uniform Commercial Code records
or the Louisiana Commercial Laws-Secured Transactions records, as applicable.

8.6.2 Default.

If any  Party  does  not pay its  share of the  charges  authorized  under  this
Agreement  when due,  the  Operator  may give the  defaulting  Party notice that
unless payment is made within thirty (30) days from delivery of the notice,  the
non-paying  Party shall be in default.  A Party in default shall have no further
access to the rig, Platform or Development Facilities,  any Confidential Data or
other maps, records,  data,  interpretations,  or other information  obtained in
connection with activities or operations  hereunder or be allowed to participate
in  meetings.  A Party in default  shall not be  entitled  to vote or to make an
election  until such time as the defaulting  Party is no longer in default.  The
voting interest of each non-defaulting  Party shall be counted in the proportion
its Participating Interest share bears to the total non-defaulting Participating
Interest  shares.  As to any  operation  approved  during the time a Party is in
default, such defaulting Party shall be deemed to be a Non-participating  Party,
except where such approval is binding on all Parties or  Participating  Parties,
as  applicable.  In the event a Party believes that such statement of charges is
incorrect,  the Party shall nevertheless pay the amounts due as provided herein,
and the Operator shall attempt to resolve the issue as soon as practicable,  but
said attempt shall be made no later than sixty (60) days after receiving  notice
from the Party of such disputed charges.

8.6.3 Unpaid Charges.

If any  Participating  Party  fails to pay its  share  of the  costs  and  other
expenses  authorized  under this Agreement in accordance  with Exhibit "C" or to
otherwise  perform any of its  obligations  under this  Agreement  when due, the
Party to whom such payment is due, in order to take  advantage of the provisions
of this  Article 8.6,  shall  notify the other Party by certified or  registered
U.S.  Mail that it is in default  and has thirty  (30) days from the  receipt of
such notice to pay. If such payment is not made timely by the  non-paying  Party
after the issuance of such notice to pay, the Party  requesting such payment may
take  immediate  steps to diligently  pursue  collection of the unpaid costs and
other expenses owed by such Participating Party and to exercise the mortgage and
security  rights  granted  by this  Agreement.  The  bringing  of a suit and the
obtaining of a judgment by any Party for the secured  indebtedness  shall not be
deemed an election of remedies or otherwise  affect the security  rights granted
herein. In addition to any


                                       133
<PAGE>

other  remedy  afforded by law,  each Party shall have,  and is hereby given and
vested with,  the power and authority to foreclose the lien,  mortgage,  pledge,
and security interest  established hereby in its favor in the manner provided by
law, to exercise the Power of Sale provided for herein,  if  applicable,  and to
exercise  all rights of a secured  party  under the Uniform  Commercial  Code as
adopted by the state in which the Lease is located or such other  states as such
Party may deem  appropriate.  The  Operator  shall keep an  accurate  account of
amounts owed by the nonperforming Party (plus interest and collection costs) and
any amounts collected with respect to amounts owed by the  nonperforming  Party.
In the event there become three or more Parties to this  Agreement,  then if any
nonperforming  Party's share of costs remains  delinquent  for a period of sixty
(60) days, each other  Participating  Party shall, upon the Operator's  request,
pay the unpaid amount of costs in the proportion that its Working Interest bears
to the total non-defaulting  Working Interests.  Each Participating Party paying
its share of the unpaid amounts of a nonperforming  Party shall be subrogated to
the Operator's mortgage and security rights to the extent of the payment made by
such Participating Party.

8.6.4 Carved-out Interests.

Any agreements creating any overriding royalty, production payment, net proceeds
interest,  net profits  interest,  carried interest or any other interest carved
out of a Working  Interest in the Lease shall  specifically  make such interests
inferior  to the rights of the  Parties to this  Agreement.  If any Party  whose
Working  Interest  is so  encumbered  does not pay its  share of costs and other
expenses authorized under this Agreement,  and the proceeds from the sale of its
Hydrocarbon production pursuant to this Article 8.6 are insufficient to pay such
costs and expenses,  the security rights provided for in this Article 8.6 may be
applied   against  the  carved-out   interests  with  which  the  defaulting  or
non-performing  Party's  interest in the Lease is burdened.  In such event,  the
rights of the owner of such  carved-out  interest shall be  subordinated  to the
security rights granted by this Article 8.6.
