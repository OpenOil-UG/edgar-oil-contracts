 ARTICLE II  AMENDMENTS  Effective as of the Effective Date, the Agreement is amended
as follows:  2.1 Amendments to Section 1.2. Section 1.2 of the Agreement is amended as follows: 
(a) clause (g) of the definition of Permitted Liens appearing in such Section 1.2 is amended to read as follows in
its entirety:  (g) Liens securing the purchase price or rental obligations of or with respect to Property, including
vehicles and equipment, acquired or leased by the Borrower or any of the Guarantors in the ordinary course of business (including Liens existing under conditional sale or title retention contracts) or Indebtedness secured by Liens against Property,
including vehicles and equipment, owned by the Borrower or any of the Guarantors for use in the ordinary course of business at the time the relevant Lien is created, provided that such Liens cover only the acquired, leased or owned and the
aggregate unpaid purchase price, rental obligations or Indebtedness secured by such Liens does not violate Section 6.1,; and  (b) to amend the definition of Obligations to except from the scope thereof all Excluded Swap Obligations; and  (c) to add to such Section 1.2 the following definitions, each in its proper alphabetical location:  Commodity Exchange Act shall mean the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.).  Eligible Contract Participant shall mean an eligible contract participant as defined in the Commodity Exchange Act and the regulations thereunder. 
Excluded Swap Obligation shall mean, with respect to any Guarantor, any Swap Obligation if, and to the extent that, all
or a portion of the Guaranty of such Guarantor of, or the grant by such Guarantor of a security interest to secure, such Swap Obligation (or any Guaranty thereof) is or becomes illegal under the Commodity Exchange Act or any rule, regulation or
order of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (or the application or official interpretation of any thereof) by virtue of such Guarantors failure, for any reason, to constitute an Eligible Contract Participant thereunder at the time the
Guaranty of such Guarantor or the grant of such security interest becomes effective with respect to such Swap Obligation and, if a Swap Obligation arises under a 
   -3-






 
master agreement governing more than one swap such exclusion shall apply only to the portion of such Swap Obligation that is attributable to Commodity Hedge Agreements or Interest Rate Hedge
Agreements for which such Guaranty or security interest is or becomes illegal.  Qualified ECP Guarantor
means, in respect of any Swap Obligation, each Guarantor that has total assets exceeding $10,000,000 at the time the relevant Guaranty or grant of the relevant security interest becomes effective with respect to such Swap Obligation or such other
Person as constitutes as Eligible Contract Participant and can cause another Person to qualify as an Eligible Contract Participant at such time by entering into a keepwell under Section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the Commodity Exchange Act.
 Swap Obligation means, with respect to any Guarantor, any obligation to pay or perform under any agreement,
contract or transaction that constitutes a swap within the meaning of Section 1a(47) of the Commodity Exchange Act.  2.2 Addition of Section 2.26. A new Section 2.26 is added to the Agreement reading as follows:  2.26 Keepwell. Each Qualified ECP Guarantor hereby jointly and severally, absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to provide such funds or other support as may be needed from
time to time by each other Guarantor to honor all of its obligations under its Guaranty in respect of Swap Obligations; provided, however, that each Qualified ECP Guarantor shall only be liable under this Section 2.26 for
the maximum amount of such liability that can be hereby incurred without rendering its obligations under this Section 2.26, or otherwise under its Guaranty, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent
transfer, and not of any greater amount. The obligations of each Qualified ECP Guarantor under this Section 2.26 shall remain in full force and effect until the Obligations are paid in full and all Commitments are terminated or have
lapsed. Each Qualified ECP Guarantor intends that this Section 2.26 constitute, and this Section 2.26 shall be deemed to constitute, a keepwell, support or other agreement for the benefit of each other Guarantor
for all purposes of Section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the Commodity Exchange Act. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, the Obligations guaranteed by any Guarantor or secured by any Lien granted by such
Guarantor under any Loan Document shall exclude all Excluded Swap Obligations with respect to such Guarantor.

is executed, ninety percent (90%) of the reasonably anticipated projected production from proved developed producing reserves for each month during the period during which such Commodity Hedge Agreement is in effect for each of crude oil and
natural gas, calculated separately, for each of the next four succeeding calendar years and seventy percent (70%) of the reasonably anticipated projected production from proved developed producing reserves for each month during the period
during which such Commodity Hedge Agreement is in effect for each of crude oil and natural gas, calculated separately, for the fifth succeeding calendar year and up to eighty percent (80%) of each component of the projected production of
