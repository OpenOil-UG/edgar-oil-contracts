   2

incorporation or other organizational documents, as the case may be, (b) contravene any material contractual restriction, law or governmental regulation or court decree or order binding on or affecting Borrower or any Subsidiary, or
(c) result in, or require the creation or imposition of, any Lien, not permitted by Section 7.1 of the Credit Agreement, on any of Borrowers or any Subsidiarys properties.

 SECTION 7. Severability of Provisions. Any provision of this Amendment held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in
any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a
particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.  SECTION 8.
Counterparts. This Amendment may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract.
 SECTION 9. Headings. Article and section headings used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of
this Amendment and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into consideration in interpreting, this Amendment. 
   3

upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted under the terms of the Credit Agreement.  SECTION 11. No Oral Agreements.
