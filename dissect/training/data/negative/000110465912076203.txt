(b)                                 On the Fifth Amendment Effective Date, each Bank the Commitment Percentage of which is increasing pursuant to this Fifth Amendment shall purchase a pro rata portion of the outstanding Revolving Loans (and participations in Letters of Credit) of each of the Banks the Commitment Percentages of which are decreasing pursuant hereto (and such Banks hereby agree to sell and to take all such further action to effectuate such sale) such that each Bank shall hold its applicable Commitment Percentage of the outstanding Revolving Loans (and participations in Letters of Credit) after giving effect to the increase in the aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts. For the sake of clarity, the sale and purchase of such Revolving Loans (and participations in
 
4






 
Letters of Credit) shall not result in any obligation on the part of Borrower under Section 3.3 of the Agreement.
 
(c)                                  The Borrower, each Guarantor, the Administrative Agent and each Bank acknowledge and agree that Branch Banking and Trust Company is a Bank for all purposes of the Loan Papers and that each reference in the Loan Papers to such Bank as Branch Banking and Trust without the word Company is intended to be, and shall be deemed to be, a reference to Branch Banking and Trust Company.
 
Section 3.                                           Omnibus Amendment to Loan Papers Regarding Buildings, etc.  Notwithstanding anything in any Loan Paper to the contrary, (a) in no event shall the defined terms Collateral, Realty Collateral or any similar defined term describing any interest in any asset or property pledged by any Credit Party pursuant to the Loan Papers to secure the Obligations include any Building (as defined in the applicable Flood Insurance Regulations (as defined below)) or Manufactured (Mobile) Home (as defined in the applicable Flood Insurance Regulations) and (b) no Building or Manufactured (Mobile) Home shall be subject to any Lien created by any Loan Papers.  Each Bank and Letter of Credit Issuer hereby empowers and authorizes Administrative Agent to execute and deliver any and all releases of Liens, termination statements, mortgage amendments or other documents required to effectuate the foregoing.  As used herein, Flood Insurance Regulations means (i) the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 as now or hereafter in effect or any successor statute thereto, (ii) the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 as now or hereafter in effect or any successor statute thereto, (iii) the National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994 (amending 42 USC § 4001, et seq.), as the same may be amended or recodified from time to time, and (iv) the Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2004 and any regulations promulgated thereunder.
 
Section 4.                                           Borrowing Base.  In reliance on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Fifth Amendment, and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 5 hereof, the Borrowing Base shall be redetermined to be, effective as of the Fifth Amendment Effective Date, $825,000,000 and shall remain at $825,000,000 until the next Determination or other adjustment to the Borrowing Base under the Credit Agreement thereafter.  Borrower and Banks agree that the Determination provided for in this Section 4 will constitute the November 1, 2012 Periodic Determination for the purposes of the Credit Agreement and shall not be construed or deemed to be a Special Determination for purposes of the Credit Agreement.
 
Section 5.                                           Conditions Precedent.  The effectiveness of this Fifth Amendment is subject to the following:
 
5.1                               Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts of this Fifth Amendment from the Obligors and each of the Banks (including the New Banks).
 
5.2                               Administrative Agent shall have received a Note payable to the order of each Bank in the amount of such Banks Maximum Credit Amount as indicated on Schedule 1 to the Credit Agreement (as amended hereby), in each case duly executed and delivered by Borrower.
 
5






 
5.3                               Contemporaneously with the effectiveness of the increase of the Borrowing Base contained in Section 4 hereof, Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Banks, a Borrowing Base increase fee equal to 40 basis points (0.40%) on the amount by which the Borrowing Base as established in Section 4 hereof exceeds the Borrowing Base that was in effect immediately prior to the establishment of the new Borrowing Base pursuant to Section 4 hereof (the Increase).  Such fee shall be distributed by Administrative Agent to the Banks in accordance with the portion of the Increase attributable to each such Bank (calculated based on the amount by which such Banks Commitment Percentage of the Borrowing Base as established in Section 4 hereof exceeds such Banks Commitment Percentage of the Borrowing Base, if any, that was in effect immediately prior to the establishment of the new Borrowing Base pursuant to Section 4 hereof).
 
5.4                               Administrative Agent shall have received such other documents as Administrative Agent or special counsel to Administrative Agent may reasonably request.
 
Administrative Agent shall notify Borrower and the Banks of the effectiveness of this Fifth Amendment, and such notice shall be conclusive and binding.  Promptly upon receipt of any replacement Note under Section 5.2 hereof, each Bank shall return to Administrative Agent (for delivery to Borrower for cancellation) any other Note in such Banks possession that was previously delivered to such Bank under the Credit Agreement.
 
Section 6.                                           New Banks.  Each New Bank hereby joins in, becomes a party to, and agrees to comply with and be bound by the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement as a Bank thereunder and under each and every other Loan Paper to which any Bank is required to be bound by the Credit Agreement, to the same extent as if such New Bank were an original signatory thereto.  Each New Bank hereby appoints and authorizes Administrative Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers and discretion under the Credit Agreement as are delegated to Administrative Agent by the terms thereof, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto.  Each New Bank represents and warrants that (a) it has full power and authority, and has taken all action necessary, to execute and deliver this Fifth Amendment, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and to become a Bank under the Credit Agreement, (b) it has received a copy of the Credit Agreement and copies of the most recent financial statements delivered pursuant to Section 8.1 thereof, and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Fifth Amendment and to become a Bank on the basis of which it has made such analysis and decision independently and without reliance on Administrative Agent or any other Bank, and (c) from and after the Fifth Amendment Effective Date, it shall be a party to and be bound by the provisions of the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Papers and have the rights and obligations of a Bank thereunder.
 
Section 7.                                           Representations and Warranties; Etc.  Each Obligor hereby affirms: (a) that as of the date hereof, all of the representations and warranties contained in each Loan Paper to which such Obligor is a party are true and correct in all material respects as though made on and as of the date hereof (unless made as of a specific earlier date, in which case, was true as of such date), (b) no Defaults exist under the Loan Papers or will, after giving effect to this Fifth Amendment, exist under the Loan Papers and (c) no Material Adverse Change has occurred.
 
6






 
Section 8.                                           Miscellaneous.
 
8.1                               Confirmation and Effect.  The provisions of the Credit Agreement (as amended by this Fifth Amendment) shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms following the effectiveness of this Fifth Amendment.  Each reference in the Credit Agreement to this Agreement, hereunder, hereof, herein, or words of like import shall mean and be a reference to the Credit Agreement as amended hereby, and each reference to the Credit Agreement in any other document, instrument or agreement executed and/or delivered in connection with the Credit Agreement shall mean and be a reference to the Credit Agreement as amended hereby.
 
8.2                               Ratification and Affirmation of Obligors.  Each of the Obligors hereby expressly (a) acknowledges the terms of this Fifth Amendment, (b) ratifies and affirms its obligations under the Facility Guaranty and the other Loan Papers to which it is a party, (c) acknowledges, renews and extends its continued liability under the Facility Guaranty and the other Loan Papers to which it is a party and (d) agrees that its guarantee under the Facility Guaranty and the other Loan Papers to which it is a party remains in full force and effect with respect to the Obligations as amended hereby.
 
8.3                               Counterparts.  This Fifth Amendment may be executed by one or more of the parties hereto in any number of separate counterparts, and all of such counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument.

8.4                               No Oral Agreement.  This written Fifth Amendment, the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Papers executed in connection herewith and therewith represent the final agreement between the parties and may not be contradicted by evidence of prior, contemporaneous, or unwritten oral agreements of the parties.  There are no subsequent oral agreements between the parties.

8.7                               Severability.  Any provision of this Fifth Amendment which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

8.8                               Successors and Assigns.  This Fifth Amendment shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.
