if the holder (other than the Lender) of any Lien against the property, assets and undertakings of the Borrower does anything to enforce or realize on such Lien,

(g)  
if any execution, sequestration or any other process of any kind is levied upon or enforced against any of the property, assets or undertakings of the Borrower, unless such process is disputed in good faith and, in the reasonable opinion of the Lender, does not jeopardize or impair the security constituted by this Agreement or any of the other Security Documents in any material way;

12.  
MISCELLANEOUS


 
12.1 Pay Costs.  The Borrower and the Lender will be responsible for their own expenses in connection with this Agreement.

12.3 Conflict.  In the event of any inconsistency or conflict between any of the provisions of this Agreement and any of the provisions of the other Security Documents, the provisions of this Agreement will prevail, provided that the omission from this Agreement of any covenant, agreement, term, or condition contained in any of the other Security Documents will not be considered to be an inconsistency or a conflict.
 
12.4 Announcements. The parties shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any filings or public statements with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein and shall not issue such press release without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, in each case, subject to applicable Laws and the exercise of such fiduciary duties, as may be appropriate.
 
12.5 Waiver.
 

(a)  
No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement will constitute a waiver of any other provision (whether or not similar).  No waiver will be binding unless




(b)  
executed in writing by the party to be bound by the waiver.  A partys failure or delay in exercising any right under this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of that right. A single or partial exercise of any right will not preclude a party from any other or further exercise of that right or the exercise of any other right.


 

(c)  
If a party waives compliance with any of the conditions, obligations or covenants contained in this Agreement, the waiver will be without prejudice to any of its rights of termination in the event of non-fulfilment, non-observance or non-performance of any other condition, obligation or covenant in whole or in part.


 
12.6 Further Assurances.  Each of the parties hereto will forthwith at all times, and from time to time, at the Borrowers sole cost and expense, do, execute, acknowledge and deliver, or cause to be done, executed, acknowledged and delivered, all such further acts, deeds, documents and assurances which, in the opinion of the Lender, acting reasonably, are necessary or advisable for the better accomplishing and effecting of the intent of this Agreement.
 
12.7 Assignment.  Neither this Agreement nor any benefits hereunder may be transferred, assigned or otherwise disposed of by either party without the prior written consent of the other party.
 
12.8 Amendment.  No amendment, waiver or modification of, or agreement collateral to, this Agreement or any of the other Security Documents will be enforceable against any party hereto unless it is by a formal instrument in writing expressed to be a modification of this Agreement or the other Security Documents, as the case may be, and executed in the same fashion as this Agreement.
 
12.9 Enurement.  All covenants and other agreements in this Agreement contained by or on behalf of any of the parties hereto will bind and enure to the benefit of the respective successors and assigns of the parties hereto (including, without limitation, any transferee) whether so expressed or not, provided, however, that the Borrower may not assign its rights or obligations hereunder to any Person.



8



12.10 Governing Law.  This Agreement will be construed and enforced in accordance with, and the rights of the parties will be governed by the Laws of the Province of British Columbia and the federal Laws of Canada applicable therein.  The Lender and the Borrower hereby exclusively attorn to the courts of competent jurisdiction of the Province of British Columbia, Canada in any proceedings hereunder.
 
12.11 Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in two or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, and it will not be necessary in making proof of this Agreement to produce or account for more than one such counterpart.
 
12.12 Independent Covenants.  All covenants hereunder will be given independent effect so that if a particular action or condition is prohibited by any one of such covenants, the fact that it would be permitted by an exception to, or otherwise be in compliance within the limitations of, another covenant will not avoid the occurrence of a default or Event of Default if such action is taken or such condition exists.
  
12.13 Severability.  Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall (to the full extent permitted by law) not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.
 
12.14 Discharge.  Upon repayment in full of the Borrowers Indebtedness and the cancellation by the Lender and the Borrower in writing of the Loan, the Lender will execute and deliver to the Borrower a release and discharge of the Security Documents.
 
12.15 Entire Agreement.  This Agreement (including the schedules attached hereto) and the other Security Documents constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Loan and their execution has not been induced by, nor do any of the parties rely upon or regard as material, any representations or writings whatever not incorporated herein or therein and made a part hereof or thereof. This Agreement and the other Security Documents supersede and replace any preliminary or other agreement or arrangement, whether oral or written, express or implied, statutory or otherwise heretofore existing among the parties in respect of the Loan.
