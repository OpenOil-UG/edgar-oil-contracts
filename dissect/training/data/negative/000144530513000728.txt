(as amended or modified with consent of the Backstop DIP Lenders, the “Plan”), subject to the occurrence of the effective date of the Plan (the “Plan Effective Date”), the DIP Agent shall receive for the ratable account of the Lenders the DIP Equity Distribution in full settlement, release and discharge of the Outstanding Amount of the Loans.  The “DIP Equity Distribution” means the new common stock of reorganized Geokinetics Inc. (“New Common Stock”) to be issued on the Plan Effective Date and to be distributed to the Lenders commencing on the Plan Effective Date, in an amount which shall be calculated by converting the Outstanding Amount of the Loans1 to New Common Stock at a 20% discount to the value of the New Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Plan as of the Plan Effective Date.  The value of the New Common Stock is $224 million based on the enterprise value of the Debtors as set forth in the Solicitation and Disclosure Statement for the Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Geokinetics Inc., et al. (the “Disclosure Statement”).The calculation of the percentage of shares of New Common Stock to be issued as part of the DIP Equity Distribution (the “DIP Lender Shares”) shall be determined using the following formula:Outstanding Amount of the Loans ÷ $179.2 million2 = percentage of aggregate shares of New Common Stock to be issued as part of the DIP Equity Distribution.3  For example, if the Outstanding Amount of the Loans on the Plan Effective Date is $25 million and if there are 600,000 shares of New Common Stock to be issued in the aggregate, then the distribution of shares shall be calculated as follows:$25 million ÷ $179.2 million = 14%DIP Equity Distribution    (14% of 600,000)84,000 sharesNoteholder Distribution4 (86% of 600,000)516,000 sharesTotal600,000 shares    ___________________________ 1 This may include other amounts to the extent owed as provided in the Plan.2 This amount represents the aggregate value of the New Common Stock to be distributed pursuant to the Plan at a 20% discount to the value ($224 million) set forth in section C of the Valuation Analysis attached as Exhibit E to the Disclosure Statement. 3 Any fractional share resulting from such calculation shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number, and no cash payments shall be made in connection with such rounding.4 The “Noteholder Distribution” means the shares of New Common Stock to be issued to holders of the 9.75% Senior Secured Notes Due 2014 pursuant to section III.C(iv) of the Plan.Schedule 2.07203367771 us\collish\8845146.8SCHEDULE 5.03  Governmental Authorizations and Filings None.Schedule 5.03203367771 us\collish\8845146.8SCHEDULE 5.06  LitigationThreatened:1.Francis and Erma Franson v. Geokinetics Inc.a.This is threatened property damage litigation arising from drilling performed on Plaintiffs' property in North Dakota. Settlement negotiations are underway with local counsel in North Dakota.  A formal lawsuit has not been filed.  Settlement offer has not yet been accepted or rejected.  2.Insurance Reimbursement Claim from Fidelity against Geokinetics USA, Inc. (“GOK”)a.Fidelity is seeking reimbursement for the settlement of claims on a project in which GOK acted as a subcontractor.  There is a dispute as to whether Fidelity is due reimbursement. A client wants to be reimbursed for damage claims it settled as a result of work which GOK performed.  GOK’s position is that the claims are the responsibility of Fidelity.  The reimbursement requested is $293,000.  There are 2 property owners that have not settled and have requested an increase in the funds offered.  The status of these two claims is outstanding.Pending:1.Ronald and Paula Herman v. Geokinetics Inc. and Geokinetics USA, Inc. (collectively, “GOK”) (Case No. 2012-7429 in the Court of Common Pleas Washington County, Washington County, Pennsylvania)a.Plaintiffs contend that GOK, following the completion of seismic activities on the Plaintiff's property, negligently disassembled and gathered wire, electrical products and batteries, causing a fire on the Plaintiff's property. The fire destroyed a section of woods near Plaintiff's home, as well as a drain pipe that runs underneath Plaintiff's driveway. Plaintiff requested arbitration on their petition.2. Suzanne Hedden v. Geokinetics Inc. (“GOK”) (filed in the District Court of Elbert County, Colorado)a.Plaintiff claims GOK trespassed on her property and is interfering with the enjoyment of said property.  Plaintiff further claims GOK's equipment is emitting radio beams, sickening she and her six dogs. GOK has filed a Motion to Dismiss and Plaintiff has responded with a Motion to set aside the Motion to Dismiss. The claim value is $500,000 plus punitive damages. GOK would be responsible for the first $100,000 and GOK’s insurance would bear the remainder.Schedule 5.06203367771us\collish\8845146.8SCHEDULE 5.07(b)(i)  Owned Real PropertyNone.Schedule 5.07(b)(i)203367771 us\collish\8845146.8SCHEDULE 5.07(b)(ii)  Leased Real PropertyGeokinetics Inc.1.Lease Agreement dated October 16, 2007 between Nickson Westland Industrial, LLC and Geokinetics Inc.
