The Allocated Value for an Asset is equal to the portion of the Unadjusted Purchase Price that is allocated to such Asset on Schedule 3.4, increased or decreased by a share of each adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price in accordance with Section 3.3.  The share of each adjustment allocated to a particular Asset shall be allocated to the particular Asset to which such adjustment relates to the extent such adjustment relates to such Asset and to the extent that it is, in the commercially reasonable discretion of Seller, possible to do so.  Any adjustment not allocated to a specific Asset pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence shall be allocated among the various Assets on a pro-rata basis in proportion to the Unadjusted Purchase Price allocated to such Asset on Schedule 3.4.  Seller has accepted such Allocated Values for purposes of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, but makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy of such values.Section 3.5    Like-Kind Exchange.   Either Party may elect to structure this transaction as a like-kind exchange pursuant to Section 1031 of the Code, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, with respect to any or all of the Properties (a "Like-Kind Exchange") at any time prior to the date of Closing. In order to effect a Like-Kind Exchange, non-electing Party shall cooperate and do all acts as may be reasonably required or requested by the Party electing for a Like-Kind Exchange with regard to effecting such Like-Kind Exchange, including, but not limited to, permitting such party to assign its rights under this Agreement to a Qualified Intermediary ("QI") of such Party's choice in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4) or executing additional escrow instructions, documents, agreements or instruments to effect an exchange; provided, however, Purchaser shall not be required to take title to any property other than the Properties in connection with the Like-Kind Exchange, and ‑8‑519552 000003 7208858.4Purchaser's possession of the Properties will not be delayed by reason of any such Like-Kind Exchange. Purchaser reserves the right, at or prior to Closing, to assign its rights or a portion thereof under this Agreement with respect to any or all of the Properties to Purchaser's Qualified Exchange Accommodation Titleholder (as that term is defined in Revenue Procedure 2000-37) ("QEAT") in connection with effecting a Like-Kind Exchange. Seller and Purchaser acknowledge and agree that a whole or partial assignment of this Agreement to a QI or QEAT shall not release either Seller or Purchaser from, or expand, any of their respective liabilities and obligations to each other under this Agreement. The Party not participating in the Like-Kind Exchange shall not be obligated to pay any additional costs or incur any additional obligations in its sale or purchase, as applicable, of the Properties if such costs are the result of the other Party's Like-Kind Exchange, and the Party electing to consummate the sale as a Like-Kind Exchange agrees to hold harmless and indemnify the other Party from and against all claims, losses and liabilities, if any, resulting from the Like-Kind Exchange.ARTICLE 4TITLE AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERSSection 4.1    Seller's Title.  Except for the special warranty of title set forth in the Conveyances, Seller makes no warranty or representation, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to Seller's title to any of the Assets and Purchaser hereby acknowledges and agrees that, subject to Section 4.5, Purchaser's sole remedy for any defect of title, including any Ownership Defect, with respect to any of the Assets, (a) on or before the applicable Ownership Claim Date, shall be as set forth in Section 4.2 and (b) from and after the applicable Ownership Claim Date (without duplication), shall be pursuant to the special warranty of title set forth in the Conveyances; provided, however, that Purchaser further acknowledges and agrees that Purchaser shall not be entitled to protection under the special warranty of title provided in the Conveyances for any Ownership Defect reported under this Article 4.

To be effective, each Ownership Defect Notice shall be in writing and shall include (i) a description of the alleged Ownership Defect that is reasonably sufficient for Seller to determine the basis of the alleged Ownership Defect, (ii) a description of the Property adversely affected by the Ownership Defect (each a "Ownership Defect Property"), (iii) the Allocated Value of each Ownership Defect Property, (iv)  documents upon which Purchaser relies for its assertion of an Ownership Defect, including, at a minimum, supporting documents reasonably necessary for Seller (as well as any title attorney or examiner hired by Seller) to verify the existence of the alleged Ownership Defect and (v) the amount by which Purchaser reasonably believes the Allocated Value of each Ownership Defect Property is reduced by the alleged Ownership Defect and the computations and information upon which Purchaser's belief is based.‑9‑519552 000003 7208858.4(b)    Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at its sole cost, to cure on or before 60 days after the Closing Date (the "Cure Period") any Ownership Defects for which Seller has received an Ownership Defect Notice from Purchaser prior to the Ownership Claim Date; provided, however that Environmental Defects included in Ownership Defect must be cured by Seller, if at all, prior to the Closing.  No reduction shall be made to the Closing Payment with respect to any Ownership Defect for which Seller has properly provided notice to Purchaser prior to or on the Closing Date that Seller intends to attempt to cure the Ownership Defect during the Cure Period (a "Remedy Notice") or for which Seller disputes the existence (a "Disputed Defect").  If any Ownership Defect with respect to which Seller provided a Remedy Notice to Purchaser is not cured by Seller within the Cure Period, Seller shall remedy such Ownership Defect pursuant to Section 4.2(c) no later than 70 days after the Closing Date (the "Remedy Deadline"); provided, however, that any downward adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price made pursuant to Section 4.2(c) shall occur at the times set forth in Section 9.4; and provided, further, that if, prior to the Remedy Deadline, Seller and Purchaser cannot agree on (i) the proper and adequate cure for any such Ownership Defect, (ii) the Ownership Defect Amount or (iii) whether the alleged Ownership Defect constitutes an Ownership Defect, such dispute shall be finally and exclusively resolved in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.4.  An election by Seller to attempt to cure an Ownership Defect shall be without prejudice to its rights under Section 4.4 and shall not constitute an admission against interest or a waiver of Seller's right to dispute the existence, nature or value of, or cost to cure, the alleged Ownership Defect.  Any Disputed Defects that have not been cured, waived or otherwise resolved by the Parties prior to the Remedy Deadline shall be exclusively and finally resolved in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.4.(c)    In the event that any Ownership Defect is not waived by Purchaser or, subject to Section 4.2(b), cured prior to the expiration of the Cure Period, and subject to the Individual Defect Threshold and the Aggregate Defect Deductible and any offsets for Title Benefits, if such Ownership Defect is an Environmental Defect and the Ownership Defect Amount exceeds the Allocated Value of the Ownership Defect Property, Seller may, at its sole election, retain the entirety of the Ownership Defect Property that is adversely affected by such Ownership Defect, in which event, the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward, by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Ownership Defect Property and such Ownership Defect Property shall no longer be included within the definition of Assets for any purpose under this Agreement.  Upon Seller electing to remedy an Environmental Defect pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Parties shall complete any further conveyancing of the relevant Ownership Defect Property as is necessary to effect such remedy.  In the event that any Ownership Defect is not waived by Purchaser or, subject to Section 4.2(b), cured prior to the expiration of the Cure Period, and Seller does not properly elect to retain such Ownership Defect Property, subject to the Individual Defect Threshold and the Aggregate Defect Deductible and any offsets for Title Benefits, the Unadjusted Purchase Price will be adjusted downward equal to an amount determined pursuant to Section 4.2(d) as being the value of such Ownership Defect (the "Ownership Defect Amount"), unless Purchaser and Seller agree in the alternative for Seller to indemnify Purchaser for any Damages arising out of such Ownership Defect.  If Purchaser and Seller agree to such a remedy, Seller will execute and deliver to Purchaser a written indemnity agreement, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, under which Seller agrees to fully, unconditionally and irrevocably indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser from any and all Damages arising out of or resulting from such Ownership Defect, in ‑10‑519552 000003 7208858.4which event no reduction shall be made to the Unadjusted Purchase Price with respect to such Ownership Defect.  Any downward adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 4.2 shall be made (and accounted for) at the times set forth in Section 9.4.(d)    The Ownership Defect Amount resulting from an Ownership Defect shall be the amount by which the Allocated Value of the Ownership Defect Property adversely affected by such Ownership Defect is reduced as a result of the existence of such Ownership Defect and shall be determined in accordance with the following methodology, terms and conditions:(i)    if Purchaser and Seller agree on the Ownership Defect Amount, that amount shall be the Ownership Defect Amount;(ii)    if the Ownership Defect is a lien, encumbrance or other charge which is undisputed and liquidated in amount, then the Ownership Defect Amount shall be the amount necessary to be paid to remove the Ownership Defect from Seller's interest in the affected Ownership Defect Property;(iii)    if the Ownership Defect reflects a discrepancy between (A) the Net Revenue Interest for the affected Ownership Defect Property and (B) the Net Revenue Interest stated in Exhibit A-2, then the Ownership Defect Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Ownership Defect Property multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the Net Revenue Interest decrease and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest stated in Exhibit A-2;(iv)    if the Ownership Defect is an Environmental Defect, the Ownership Defect Amount shall be the amount of the estimated costs and expenses to correct or remediate the Environmental Defect (as of the Closing Date) in such a manner that is consistent with applicable Environmental Laws;(v)    if the Ownership Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden or charge upon or other defect in title to the Ownership Defect Property of a type not described in clauses (ii), (iii), or (iv) above, the Ownership Defect Amount shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the Ownership Defect Property, the portion of the Ownership Defect Property adversely affected by the Ownership Defect, the legal effect of the Ownership Defect, the potential economic effect of the Ownership Defect over the life of the Ownership Defect Property, the values placed upon the Ownership Defect by Purchaser and Seller and such other factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation; provided, however, that, the foregoing considerations notwithstanding, in the event that the Ownership Defect is reasonably susceptible of being cured, the Ownership Defect Amount shall not be greater than the reasonable cost and expense of curing or remediating, as applicable, such Ownership Defect; and (vi)    the Ownership Defect Amount with respect to a Ownership Defect shall be determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in any other Ownership Defect Amount hereunder, or for which Purchaser otherwise receives credit in the calculation of the Purchase Price.‑11‑519552 000003 7208858.4(e)    It is understood and agreed that Environmental Defects shall constitute Ownership Defects for purposes of this Agreement (as is provided in the definition of the term "Ownership Defects" set forth Appendix A) and, as such, will be handled in accordance with, and in all instances will be subject to, the provisions of this Section 4.2 and the other applicable provisions of this Article 4 (including the thresholds and deductibles set forth in Section 4.5).  As such, without limiting the disclaimers and acknowledgements set forth in Article 5 and Article 6, respectively, PURCHASER HEREBY WAIVES AND RELEASES ANY REMEDIES OR CLAIMS (WHETHER AT LAW OR IN EQUITY) THAT IT MAY HAVE AGAINST SELLER, ITS AFFILIATES OR ANY OTHER MEMBER OF THE SELLER GROUP UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS WITH RESPECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECTS, EXCEPT SOLELY FOR THOSE REMEDIES SET FORTH IN THIS ARTICLE 4 AND ARTICLE 11 (SOLELY WITH RESPECT TO THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN SECTION 5.17). Section 4.3    Title Benefits.(a)    Seller has the right, but not the obligation, to deliver to Purchaser on or before the Ownership Claim Date with respect to each Title Benefit discovered by Seller, a notice (a "Title Benefit Notice") in writing and including (i) a description of the Title Benefit reasonably sufficient to determine the basis of the alleged Title Benefit, (ii) the Lease or Well affected by such Title Benefit (each a "Title Benefit Property"), (iii) the Allocated Value of each Title Benefit Property, (iv) supporting documents reasonably necessary for Purchaser (as well as any title attorney or examiner hired by Purchaser) to verify the existence of the alleged Title Benefit and (v) the amount by which Seller reasonably believes the Allocated Value of each Title Benefit Property is increased by such Title Benefit and the computations and information upon which Seller's belief is based on or before the Ownership Claim Date with respect to each Title Benefit discovered by Seller.  (b)    An amount  equal to the increase in the Allocated Value for such Title Benefit Property, as determined pursuant to Section 4.3(c) (the "Title Benefit Amount") shall be subtracted from any Ownership Defect Amount that will be a downward adjustment to the Adjusted Purchase Price.(c)    The Title Benefit Amount resulting from a Title Benefit shall be the amount by which the Allocated Value of the Title Benefit Property affected by such Title Benefit is increased as a result of the existence of such Title Benefit and shall be determined in accordance with the following methodology, terms and conditions:(i)    if Purchaser and Seller agree on the Title Benefit Amount, that amount shall be the Title Benefit Amount;(ii)    if the Title Benefit reflects a difference between (A) the Net Revenue Interest for the affected Title Benefit Property and (B) the Net Revenue Interest stated in Exhibit A-2, then the Title Benefit Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Title Benefit Property multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the Net Revenue Interest increase and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest stated in Exhibit A-2; and‑12‑519552 000003 7208858.4(iii)    if the Title Benefit represents a benefit in the ownership or title to the Title Benefit Property of a type not described in clause (ii) above, the Title Benefit Amount shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the Title Benefit Property, the portion of the Title Benefit Property benefitted by the Title Benefit, the legal effect of the Title Benefit, the potential economic effect of the Title Benefit over the life of the Title Benefit Property, the values placed upon the Title Benefit by Purchaser and Seller and such other factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation. (d)    If Seller and Purchaser cannot reach an agreement on alleged Title Benefits and Title Benefit Amounts by the scheduled Closing, the provisions of Section 4.4 shall apply.  Section 4.4    Title Disputes.  Seller and Purchaser shall attempt to agree on all Ownership Defects and Title Benefits and Ownership Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts, respectively, prior to Closing.  If Seller and Purchaser are unable to agree on Ownership Defects and Title Benefits and Ownership Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts, respectively, by the scheduled Closing, then Purchaser's good faith estimate shall be used to determine the Closing Payment pursuant to Section 9.4.  If, after the Remedy Deadline, Seller and Purchaser are unable to agree on an alleged Ownership Defect/Title Benefit or Ownership Defect Amount/Title Benefit Amount (the "Disputed Title Matters") such dispute(s), and only such dispute(s), shall be exclusively and finally resolved in accordance with the following provisions of this Section 4.4.  Purchaser shall provide to Seller by not later than the tenth Business Day following the Remedy Deadline a written description meeting the requirements of Section 4.2(a) or Section 4.3(a), as applicable, together with reasonable supporting documentation of the Disputed Title Matters.  By not later than ten Business Days after Seller's receipt of Purchaser's written description of the Disputed Title Matters, Seller shall provide to Purchaser a written response setting forth Seller's position with respect to the Disputed Title Matters together with reasonable supporting documentation.(a)    By not later than ten Business Days after Purchaser's receipt of Seller's written response to Purchaser's written description of the Disputed Title Matters, Purchaser may initiate a non-administered arbitration of any such dispute conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the extent that such rules do not conflict with the terms of this Section 4.4, by written notice to Seller of any Disputed Title Matters ("Final Disputed Title Matters") not otherwise resolved or waived that are to be resolved by arbitration (the "Title Arbitration Notice").(b)    The arbitration shall be held before a one member arbitration panel (the "Title Arbitrator"), determined as follows.  The Title Arbitrator shall be an attorney with at least ten years' experience (i) in the case of Ownership Defects other than Environmental Defects, examining oil and gas titles in the State of Texas and (ii) in the case of Environmental Defects, as an environmental attorney practicing in the State of Texas.  In either case, the Title Arbitrator cannot have been employed directly or indirectly by any Party or any controlled Affiliate of any Party within the preceding five years. Within two Business Days following Seller's receipt of the Title Arbitration Notice, Seller and Purchaser shall each nominate two persons who would qualify to be Title Arbitrators (the "Selection Panel").  Within two Business ‑13‑519552 000003 7208858.4Days of such nomination, the Selection Panel shall confer and choose the Title Arbitrator, who must meet the criteria set forth herein.(c)    Within three Business Days following the selection of the Title Arbitrator, the Parties shall submit one copy to the Title Arbitrator of (i) this Agreement, with specific reference to this Section 4.4 and the other applicable provisions of this Article 4, (ii) Purchaser's written description of the Final Disputed Title Matters, together with the supporting documents, (iii) Seller's written response to Purchaser's written description of the Final Disputed Title Matters, together with any supporting documents, and (iv) the Title Arbitration Notice.  Within five Business Days following such submissions, each of the Parties may submit one written response to the other Party's submission.  The Title Arbitrator shall resolve the Final Disputed Title Matters based only on the foregoing submissions.  Neither Purchaser nor Seller shall have the right to demand discovery on the other Party.  (d)    The Title Arbitrator shall make its determination by written decision within 30 days following Seller's receipt of the Title Arbitration Notice (the "Arbitration Decision").  The Arbitration Decision shall be final and binding upon the Parties, without right of appeal.  In making its determination, the Title Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in this Article 4.  The Title Arbitrator may consult with and engage disinterested third Persons to advise the Title Arbitrator, but shall disclose to the Parties the identities of such consultants.  Any such consultant shall not have worked as an employee or consultant for either Party or its Affiliates during the five year period preceding the arbitration nor have any financial interest in the dispute.(e)    The Title Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed Ownership Defects and Ownership Defect Amounts or Title Benefits and Title Benefit Amounts and shall not be empowered to award damages, interest or penalties to either Party with respect to any matter.(f)    Each Party shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of preparing and presenting its case.  Seller shall bear one-half and Purchaser shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Title Arbitrator, including any costs incurred by the Title Arbitrator that are attributable to the consultation of any third Person.  Each Party shall bear the costs and expenses of its own Selection Panel member(g)    Seller and Purchaser shall implement the Arbitration Decision as follows: (i) in the case of alleged Ownership Defects determined to be Ownership Defects, Seller shall remedy such Ownership Defects pursuant to Section 4.2(c) within ten Business Days following Seller's receipt of the Arbitration Decision (with any amounts owed, as a result of such election, to be made and accounted for at the times set forth in Section 9.4(b)), (ii) in the case of disputed Title Benefits and Title Benefit Amounts or Ownership Defect Amounts, any amounts determined to be owed by either Party shall be accounted for in the determination of the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 9.4(b), and (iii) any alleged Ownership Defects/Title Benefits determined not to be Ownership Defects/Title Benefits under the Arbitration Decision shall be final and binding as not being Ownership Defects/Title Benefits.  ‑14‑519552 000003 7208858.4(h)    Any dispute over the interpretation or application of this Section 4.4 shall be decided by the Title Arbitrator with reference to the Laws of the State of Texas.  Section 4.5    Limitations on Applicability.(a)    This Article 4, the representations in Section 5.17 (and associated remedies in Article 9), and the special warranty of title provided in the respective Conveyances shall be, subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, the exclusive rights and remedies of Purchaser with respect to Ownership Defects.  The right of Purchaser or Seller to assert a Ownership Defect or Title Benefit, respectively, under this Article 4 shall terminate on the Ownership Claim Date; provided, however, that until the alleged Ownership Defect or Title Benefit or Ownership Defect Amount or Title Benefit Amount, as applicable, is resolved in accordance with this Agreement, there shall be no termination of Purchaser's or Seller's rights under this Article 4 with respect to any alleged Ownership Defect or Title Benefit or Ownership Defect Amount or Title Benefit Amount properly reported in accordance with Section 4.4 on or before the Ownership Claim Date.  Thereafter, Purchaser's and Seller's sole and exclusive rights and remedies with regard to title to the Assets shall be as set forth in the respective Conveyances.  Without limiting the foregoing, if a Ownership Defect under this Article 4 results from any matter which could also result in the breach of any representation or warranty of Seller as set forth in Article 5 and Purchaser has knowledge of such matter prior to the Ownership Claim Date, Purchaser shall only be entitled to assert such matter as a Ownership Defect to the extent permitted by this Article 4 and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be precluded from also asserting such matter as the basis of the breach of any such representation or warranty or as a claim against Seller's special warranty of title provided in the Conveyances.(b)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price or other remedies available in respect of Ownership Defects (including Ownership Defects constituting Environmental Defects) or Title Benefits, as applicable, under this Article 4:(i)    With respect to Ownership Defects, (A) for any Ownership Defect Amount with respect to an individual Ownership Defect Property if such amount does not exceed $100,000 (the "Individual Defect Threshold"); and (B) unless the aggregate amount of all such Ownership Defect Amounts (provided that each such Ownership Defect Amount exceeds the Individual Defect Threshold), in the aggregate (excluding any Ownership Defect Amounts with respect to Ownership Defects cured or indemnified by Seller in accordance with this Article 4) exceeds three percent of the Unadjusted Purchase Price (the "Aggregate Defect Deductible"), after which point, subject to the Individual Defect Threshold, Purchaser shall be entitled to adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price or other remedies elected by Seller in accordance with Section 4.2(c) only with respect to Ownership Defect Amounts in excess of such Aggregate Defect Deductible and only to the extent that Ownership Defect Amounts exceed the Aggregate Defect Deductible.(c)    Without prejudice to any of the other dates by which performance or the exercise of rights is due hereunder, or the Parties' rights or obligations in respect thereof, the Parties hereby acknowledge that, as set forth more fully in Section 13.14, time is of the essence ‑15‑519552 000003 7208858.4in performing their obligations and exercising their rights under this Article 4, and, as such, that each and every date and time by which such performance or exercise is due shall be the firm and final date and time.Section 4.6    Consents to Assignment and Preferential Rights to Purchase.(a)    Promptly after the Execution Date, Seller shall prepare and send (i) notices to the holders of any required consents to assignment that are set forth on Schedule 4.6 requesting consents to the Conveyances and (ii) notices to the holders of any applicable preferential rights to purchase or similar rights that are set forth on Schedule 4.6 in compliance with the terms of such rights and requesting waivers of such rights.  Any preferential purchase right must be exercised subject to all terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, including the successful Closing of this Agreement pursuant to Article 9 as to those Assets for which preferential purchase rights have not been exercised.  The consideration payable under this Agreement for any particular Asset for purposes of preferential purchase right notices shall be the Allocated Value for such Asset, subject to adjustment as described in Section 3.3.  Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such consents to assignment and waivers of preferential rights to purchase or similar rights (or the exercise thereof) to be obtained and delivered prior to Closing, provided that Seller shall not be required to make payments or undertake obligations to or for the benefit of the holders of such rights in order to obtain the required consents and waivers.  Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller in seeking to obtain such consents to assignment and waivers of preferential rights.(b)    In no event shall there be transferred at Closing any Asset for which a consent requirement has not been satisfied and which will terminate or in which the rights to be transferred to Purchaser will be materially impaired if transferred without the consent.  In cases in which the Asset subject to such a requirement is a Contract and Purchaser is assigned the Property or Properties to which the Contract relates, but the Contract is not transferred to Purchaser due to the unwaived consent requirement, Seller shall continue after Closing to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent so that such Contract can be transferred to Purchaser upon receipt of the consent.  In cases in which the Asset subject to such a consent requirement is a Property and the third Person consent to the transfer of the Property is not obtained by Closing, the affected Property and the Assets related to that Property shall not be transferred at Closing and the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of the Property and related Assets.  If an unsatisfied consent requirement with respect to which a Purchase Price adjustment is made under Section 3.3 is subsequently satisfied prior to the date of delivery of the final settlement statement under Section 9.4(b), a separate closing shall be held within five Business Days thereof at which (i) Seller shall convey the affected Property and related Assets to Purchaser in accordance with this Agreement and (ii) Purchaser shall pay an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Property and related Assets, adjusted in accordance with Section 3.3, to Seller.  If such consent requirement is not satisfied by the date of delivery of the final settlement statement, Seller shall have no further obligation to sell and convey such Property and related Assets and Purchaser shall have no further obligation to purchase, accept and pay for such Property, and the affected Property and related Assets shall be deemed to be deleted from Exhibit A-1 and Exhibit A-2 (and the other applicable Exhibits and Schedules) to this Agreement for all purposes.‑16‑519552 000003 7208858.4(c)    If any preferential right to purchase any Assets is exercised prior to Closing, the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be decreased by the Allocated Value for such Assets, and the affected Assets shall be deemed to be deleted from Exhibit A-1 and Exhibit A-2 (and the other applicable Exhibits and Schedules) to this Agreement for all purposes.  Seller shall retain the consideration paid by the third Person, and shall have no further obligation with respect to such affected Assets under this Agreement.  Should a third Person fail to exercise its preferential right to purchase as to any portion of the Assets prior to Closing and the time for exercise or waiver has not yet expired, the affected Assets shall not be transferred at Closing and the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Values of such Assets.  In the event that such third Person exercises its preferential right to purchase following the Closing, Seller shall have no further obligation to sell and convey the affected Assets and Purchaser shall have no further obligation to purchase, accept and pay for such affected Assets, and the affected Assets shall be deemed to be deleted from Exhibit A-1 and Exhibit A-2 (and the other applicable Exhibits and Schedules) to this Agreement for all purposes.  If, on the other hand, the applicable preferential purchase rights are waived or expire, a separate closing shall be held within five Business Days thereof at which (i) Seller shall convey the affected Assets to Purchaser in accordance with this Agreement and (ii) Purchaser shall pay an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Assets, adjusted in accordance with Section 3.3, to Seller.  Section 4.7    Casualty or Condemnation Loss.(a)    If, after the Execution Date, but prior to the Closing Date, any portion of the Assets is damaged, destroyed or made unavailable or unusable for the intended purpose by fire or other casualty or is taken in condemnation or under right of eminent domain (each a "Casualty Loss"), and the loss as a result of such individual Casualty Loss exceeds ten percent of the Unadjusted Purchase Price, neither Purchaser nor Seller shall be required to close.   Should both the Purchaser and Seller elect to close, such Casualty Loss will be treated as a Ownership Defect with respect to the affected Property under Section 4.2.  In such case, Seller will retain all rights to insurance, unpaid awards, condemnation payments, and other rights and claims against Third Parties with respect to the Casualty Loss, except to the extent the Parties otherwise agree in writing. (b)    If, after the Execution Date but prior to the Closing Date, any Casualty Loss occurs and the loss as a result of such individual Casualty Loss is less than ten percent of the Unadjusted Purchase Price, Purchaser shall nevertheless be required to close, and Seller shall elect by written notice to Purchaser prior to Closing either (i) to cause the Assets adversely affected by any such individual Casualty Loss to be repaired or restored to at least their condition prior to such Casualty Loss, at Seller's sole cost and expense, as promptly as reasonably practicable (which work may extend after the Closing Date), or (ii) to indemnify Purchaser against any costs or expenses that Purchaser reasonably incurs to repair or restore the Assets subject to any such Casualty Loss.  In each case, Seller will retain all rights to insurance, unpaid awards, condemnation payments and other rights and claims against Third Parties with respect to the Casualty Loss, except to the extent the Parties otherwise agree in writing.‑17‑519552 000003 7208858.4ARTICLE 5REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLERSection 5.1    Generally.(a)    Any representation or warranty qualified to the "knowledge of Seller" or "to Seller's knowledge" or with any similar knowledge qualification is limited to matters within the Actual Knowledge of the individuals listed in Schedule 5.1.

All claims for indemnification under Section 11.2 shall be asserted and resolved as follows:(a)    For purposes hereof, (i) the term "Indemnifying Person" when used in connection with particular Damages shall mean the Person or Persons having an obligation to indemnify another Person or Persons with respect to such Damages pursuant to this Article 11 and (ii) the term "Indemnified Person" when used in connection with particular Damages shall mean the Person or Persons having the right to be indemnified with respect to such Damages by another Person or Persons pursuant to this Article 11.(b)    To make a claim for indemnification under Section 11.2, an Indemnified Person shall notify the Indemnifying Person of its claim under this Section 11.3, including the specific details of and specific basis under this Agreement for its claim (the "Claim Notice").  In the event that the claim for indemnification is based upon a claim by a third Person against the Indemnified Person (a "Third Person Claim"), the Indemnified Person shall provide its Claim ‑39‑519552 000003 7208858.4Notice promptly after the Indemnified Person has actual knowledge of the Third Person Claim and shall enclose a copy of all papers (if any) served with respect to the Third Person Claim; provided that the failure of any Indemnified Person to give notice of a Third Person Claim as provided in this Section 11.3 shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person of its obligations under Section 11.2 except to the extent such failure results in insufficient time being available to permit the Indemnifying Person to effectively defend against the Third Person Claim or otherwise prejudices the Indemnifying Person's ability to defend against the Third Person Claim.  In the event that the claim for indemnification is based upon an inaccuracy or breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, the Claim Notice shall specify the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement which was inaccurate or breached.(c)    In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Third Person Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall have 30 days from its receipt of the Claim Notice to notify the Indemnified Person whether it admits or denies its obligation to defend the Indemnified Person against such Third Person Claim under this Article 11.  If the Indemnifying Person does not notify the Indemnified Person within such 30-day period whether the Indemnifying Person admits or denies its obligation to defend the Indemnified Person, it shall be conclusively deemed to have denied such indemnification obligation hereunder.  The Indemnified Person is authorized, prior to and during such 30-day period, to file any motion, answer or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Person and that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Person.(d)    If the Indemnifying Person admits its obligation, it shall have the right and obligation to diligently defend, at its sole cost and expense, the Third Person Claim.  The Indemnifying Person shall have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof.  If requested by the Indemnifying Person, the Indemnified Person agrees to cooperate in contesting any Third Person Claim which the Indemnifying Person elects to contest (provided, however, that the Indemnified Person shall not be required to bring any counterclaim or cross-complaint against any Person).  The Indemnified Person may at its own expense participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any Third Person Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Person pursuant to this Section 11.3(d).  An Indemnifying Person shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, settle any Third Person Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto which (i) does not result in a final resolution of the Indemnified Person's liability with respect to the Third Person Claim (including, in the case of a settlement, an unconditional written release of the Indemnified Person) or (ii) may materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Person (other than as a result of money damages covered by the indemnity).(e)    If the Indemnifying Person does not admit its obligation or admits its obligation but fails to diligently defend or settle the Third Person Claim, then the Indemnified Person shall have the right to defend against the Third Person Claim (at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Person, if the Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification hereunder), with counsel of the Indemnified Person's choosing, subject to the right of the Indemnifying Person to admit its obligation and assume the defense of the Third Person Claim at any time prior to settlement or final determination thereof.  If the Indemnifying Person has not yet admitted its obligation to provide indemnification with respect to a Third Person Claim, the Indemnified Person shall send written notice to the Indemnifying Person of any proposed ‑40‑519552 000003 7208858.4settlement and the Indemnifying Person shall have the option for ten days following receipt of such notice to (i) admit in writing its obligation to provide indemnification with respect to the Third Person Claim and (ii) if its obligation is so admitted, reject, in its reasonable judgment, the proposed settlement.  If the Indemnified Person settles any Third Person Claim over the objection of the Indemnifying Person after the Indemnifying Person has timely admitted its obligation in writing and assumed the defense of a Third Person Claim, the Indemnified Person shall be deemed to have waived any right to indemnity therefor.(f)    In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Third Person Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall have 30 days from its receipt of the Claim Notice to (i) cure the Damages complained of, (ii) admit its obligation to provide indemnification with respect to such Damages or (iii) dispute the claim for such indemnification.  If the Indemnifying Person does not notify the Indemnified Person within such 30-day period that it has cured the Damages or that it disputes the claim for such indemnification, the Indemnifying Person shall be conclusively deemed obligated to provide such indemnification hereunder.Section 11.4    Limitation on Actions.(a)    The representations and warranties of the Parties in Article 5 and Article 6 and the covenants and agreements of the Parties in Article 7 and the corresponding representations and warranties given in the certificates delivered at Closing pursuant to Section 9.2(c) and Section 9.3(d), as applicable, shall survive the Closing for a period of twelve months (unless a shorter period is expressly provided within the applicable Section), except that (i) the representations, warranties and acknowledgements, as applicable, in Section 5.2, Section 5.3, Section 5.4, Section 5.5, Section 5.6, Section 6.1, Section 6.2, Section 6.3, Section 6.4, Section 6.5 and Section 6.13 (the "Fundamental Representations") shall survive indefinitely, (ii) the representations and warranties in Section 5.8 shall survive Closing until 60 days after the applicable statute of limitations closes the taxable year to which the subject Taxes relate and (iii) the covenants and agreements, as applicable, in Section 7.1(d), Section 7.3, Section 7.6, Section 7.7 and Section 7.10 shall survive indefinitely.  The remainder of this Agreement (including the disclaimers in Section 5.15) shall survive the Closing without time limit except (A) as may otherwise be expressly provided herein and (B) for the provisions of Article 12 and Section 13.3, which shall survive Closing until 60 days after the applicable statute of limitations closes the taxable year to which the subject Taxes relate.  Representations, warranties, covenants and agreements shall be of no further force and effect after the date of their expiration, provided that there shall be no termination of any bona fide claim asserted pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement prior to its expiration date.(b)    The indemnities in Section 11.2(a)(ii), Section 11.2(a)(iii), Section 11.2(b)(i) and Section 11.2(b)(ii) shall terminate as of the termination date of each respective representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that is subject to indemnification thereunder, except in each case as to matters for which a specific written claim for indemnity has been delivered to the Indemnifying Person on or before such termination date.  The indemnity in Section 11.2(b)(iv) shall terminate on the second anniversary of the Closing Date.
