resulting from any calculation made in accordance with the terms of this Award Agreement shall be aggregated, and any such aggregated shares will vest, and the Vested Stock will be released, at the time provided in (3)(b)(iv) above. 
Except as otherwise provided in Section 3(c) below, none of the shares subject to this Award shall vest should the Company fail to
attain the Performance Goal for the Performance Period. Except to the extent that an Award has previously vested pursuant to Section 3(c) below, this Award shall terminate in its entirety and shall not vest should the Company fail to attain the
Performance Goal for the Performance Period.  (c) Change in Control Event or Death or Disability. Notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary in this Award Agreement, a Participant shall become fully and immediately vested in the Award in the event of the Participants death or the occurrence of a Change in Control Event, without regard to attainment or
certification of the Performance Goal. In the event of the Participants death or the occurrence of a Change in Control Event, the Vested Stock will be released within a reasonable time thereafter. If the Participants Date of Termination
occurs by reason of disability, the Committee may, in its sole and absolute discretion, elect to vest all or a portion of the unvested Performance Restricted Stock upon the Participants Date of Termination and the Vested Stock will be released
within a reasonable time thereafter. 




 (d) Termination of Employment. The Participant shall forfeit the unvested portion of
the Award (including the underlying Performance Restricted Stock and Accrued Dividends) upon the occurrence of the Participants Date of Termination unless the Performance Goal is attained and certified and the Award becomes vested under the
circumstances described below.  (i) If the Participants Date of Termination occurs under circumstances in which the
Participant is entitled to a severance payment from the Company, a Subsidiary, or an Affiliated Entity under (1) the Participants employment agreement or severance agreement with the Company due to a termination of the Participants
employment by the Company without cause or by the Participant for good reason in accordance with the Participants employment agreement or severance agreement or (2) the Devon Energy Corporation Severance Plan, and

as of the Participants Date of Termination, provided the Date of Termination occurs after the Performance Goal is attained and certified, and the Performance Restricted Stock shall be released within a reasonable time thereafter. If the
Participants Date of Termination occurs before the Performance Goal is attained and certified, the Performance Restricted Stock shall be treated as vested as of the certification of attainment of the Performance Goal, and the Performance
Restricted Stock, if vested, shall be released within a reasonable time thereafter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Performance Goal is not attained and certified, or if Participant fails to sign and return the Release to the Company or
revokes the Release prior to the date the Release becomes effective, then the unvested shares of Performance Restricted Stock subject to this Award Agreement shall not vest pursuant to this Section 3(d)(i) and shall be forfeited.

circumstances (as determined by the Committee), and the Committee determines, in its sole and absolute discretion, that the Performance Restricted Stock shall continue to vest following the Participants Date of Termination, the Performance
Restricted Stock shall continue to vest after the Participants Date of Termination in accordance with the Vesting Schedule in Section 3(b) above and the Performance Restricted Stock shall be released within a reasonable time after the
applicable Vesting Date; provided that, if the Participant is Retirement Eligible, the Participant shall, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions in Section 16, be eligible to vest in accordance with the Vesting Schedule above in

 (e) Voting Rights and Dividends. The Participant shall not have voting rights
attributable to the shares of Performance Restricted Stock prior to the completion of the Performance Period and the Committees certification of the Companys attainment of the Performance Goal. Any dividends declared and paid by the
Company with respect to shares of Performance Restricted Stock prior to the Committees certification of the attainment of the Performance Goal (the Accrued Dividends) shall not be paid to the Participant until and unless the
Committee certifies the attainment of the Performance Goal. Any such Accrued Dividends shall be forfeited if the Award is terminated because the Performance Goal is not attained. If the Performance Goal is attained and certified, the Accrued
Dividends shall be paid to the Participant within a reasonable time thereafter and any dividends or other distributions (in cash or other property, but excluding extraordinary dividends) that are declared and/or paid with respect to the shares of
Performance Restricted Stock shall be paid to the Participant on a current basis. Any extraordinary dividends (i.e., special or nonrecurring dividends in excess of the regular dividends paid by the Company), in cash or property, on
Performance Restricted Stock shall not be paid until and unless the Performance Restricted Stock becomes Vested Stock.  (f)
Certification of Performance Goal. Except in the event of the occurrence of a Change in Control Event, the Committee shall, as soon as practicable following the last day of the Performance Period, determine and certify, based on the
Companys financial statements for the fiscal year coincident with the Performance Period, whether the Performance Goal for the Performance Period has been attained. Such certification shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Participant,
and on all other persons, to the maximum extent permitted by law.  (g) Vested StockRemoval of Restrictions. Upon
Performance Restricted Stock becoming Vested Stock, all restrictions shall be removed from the certificates or book-entry registrations and the Secretary of the Company shall deliver to the Participant certificates or a Direct Registration Statement
for the book-entry registration representing such Vested Stock free and clear of all restrictions, except for any applicable securities laws restrictions, together with a check in the amount of all Accrued Dividends attributed to such Vested Stock
without interest thereon.  4. Legends. The shares of Performance Restricted Stock which are the subject of this Award
Agreement shall be subject to the following legend:  THE SHARES OF STOCK EVIDENCED BY THIS CERTIFICATE OR BOOK-ENTRY
REGISTRATION ARE SUBJECT TO AND ARE TRANSFERABLE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THAT CERTAIN AWARD AGREEMENT DATED %%OPTION_DATE%-% FOR THE DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION 2009 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN, AS AMENDED AND RESTATED JUNE 6, 2012. ANY

DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION.  5. Delivery of Forfeited Shares. The Participant authorizes the Secretary to deliver
to the Company any and all shares of Performance Restricted Stock that are forfeited under the provisions of this Award Agreement. The Participant further authorizes the Company to hold as a general obligation of the Company any Accrued Dividends
and to pay the Accrued Dividends to the Participant at the time the underlying Performance Restricted Stock becomes Vested Stock. 




 6. Certain Corporate Changes. If any change is made to the Common Stock (whether by
reason of merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split, combination of shares, or exchange of shares or any other change in capital structure made without receipt of consideration), then unless such event or
change results in the termination of all the Performance Restricted Stock granted under this Award Agreement, the Committee shall adjust, in an equitable manner and as provided in the Plan, the number and class of shares underlying the Performance
Restricted Stock, the maximum number of shares for which the Award may vest, and the share price or class of Common Stock as appropriate, to reflect the effect of such event or change in the Companys capital structure in such a way as to
preserve the value of the Award.  7. Employment. Nothing in the Plan or in this Award Agreement shall confer upon the
Participant any right to continue in the employ of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliated Entities, or interfere in any way with the right to terminate the Participants employment at any time. 
8. Nontransferability of Award. The Participant shall not have the right to sell, assign, transfer, convey, dispose, pledge,
hypothecate, burden, encumber or charge any Performance Restricted Stock or any interest therein in any manner whatsoever.  9.
Notices. All notices or other communications relating to the Plan and this Award Agreement as it relates to the Participant shall be in writing and shall be delivered electronically, personally or mailed (U.S. mail) by the Company to the
Participant at the then current address as maintained by the Company or such other address as the Participant may advise the Company in writing.  10. Binding Effect and Governing Law.

and state laws and regulations respecting the required withholding, deposit and payment of any income, employment or other taxes relating to the Award (including Accrued Dividends). The Company shall withhold the employers minimum statutory
withholding based upon minimum statutory withholding rates for federal and state purposes, including payroll taxes that are applicable to such supplemental taxable income. Any payment of required withholding taxes by the Participant in the form of
Common Stock shall not be permitted if it would result in an accounting charge with respect to such shares used to pay such taxes unless otherwise approved by the Committee.

Re:

 This letter agreement is entered between Devon Energy Corporation (together with its subsidiaries and affiliates, the
Company) and the undersigned (the Participant) in connection with that certain Performance Restricted Stock Award Agreement (the Agreement) dated

have the same meaning ascribed to them in the Agreement unless specifically denoted otherwise.  The Participant acknowledges
that, during the course of and in connection with the employment relationship between the Participant and the Company, the Company provided and the Participant accepted access to the Companys trade secrets and confidential and proprietary
information, which included, without limitation, information pertaining to the Companys finances, oil and gas properties and prospects, compensation structures, business and litigation strategies and future business plans and other information
or material that is of special and unique value to the Company and that the Company maintains as confidential and does not disclose to the general public, whether through its annual report and/or filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission
or otherwise (the Confidential Information).  The Participant acknowledges that his position with the Company was
one of trust and confidence because of the access to the Confidential Information, requiring the Participants best efforts and utmost diligence to protect and maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information. Unless required by the
Company or with the Companys express written consent, the Participant will not, during the term of this letter agreement, directly or indirectly, disclose to others or use for his own benefit or the benefit of another any of the Confidential
Information, whether or not the Confidential Information is acquired, learned, attained or developed by the Participant alone or in conjunction with others.  The Participant agrees that, due to his access to the Confidential Information, the Participant would inevitably use and/or disclose that Confidential Information in breach of his confidentiality and
non-disclosure obligations if the Participant worked in certain capacities or engaged in certain activities for a period of time following his employment with the Company, specifically in a position that involves (i) responsibility and
decision-making authority or input at the executive level regarding any subject or responsibility, (ii) decision-making responsibility or input at any management level in the Participants individual area of assignment with the Company, or
(iii) responsibility and decision-making authority or input that otherwise allows the use of the Confidential Information (collectively referred to as the Restricted Occupation). Therefore, except with the prior written consent of
the Company, 




 
during the term of this letter agreement, the Participant agrees not to be employed by, consult for or otherwise act on behalf of any person or entity in any capacity in which he would be
involved, directly or indirectly, in a Restricted Occupation. The Participant acknowledges that this commitment is intended to protect the Confidential Information and is not intended to be applied or interpreted as a covenant against competition.
 The Participant further agrees that during the term of this letter agreement, the Participant will not, directly or
indirectly on behalf of a person or entity or otherwise, (i) solicit any of the established customers of the Company or attempt to induce any of the established customers of the Company to cease doing business with the Company, or
(ii) solicit any of the employees of the Company to cease employment with the Company.  This letter agreement shall
become effective upon execution by the Participant and the Company and shall terminate on December 31, 20    . [Note: Insert date that is the end of the calendar year of the letter agreement.] 
If you agree to the above terms and conditions, please execute a copy of this letter agreement below and return a copy to me.
