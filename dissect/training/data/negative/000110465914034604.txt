(B)
 
(i)            Subject to (ii) below, the Borrower shall pay to the Facility Agent (for the account of each LC Lender) a letter of credit fee computed at the same rate as the Margin on the outstanding amount of each Letter of Credit for the period from the issue of that Letter of Credit until its Expiry Date.  This fee shall be distributed according to each LC Lenders LC Proportion of that Letter of Credit.
 
(ii)           The Borrower shall be entitled to deduct, from the letter of credit fee calculated as described in (i) above and paid to the Facility Agent, in respect of each Relevant Lender, an amount which is the product of the Margin and any Borrower Replacement Collateral (as defined in clause 8.10 below) held in respect of such Relevant Lender (the RL Reduction).  The net fee distributed by the Facility Agent to each Relevant Lender shall be the fee calculated according to such Relevant Lenders LC Proportion then reduced by the amount of the RL Reduction.

60






 
(i)            is not obliged to carry out any investigation or seek any confirmation from any other person before paying a claim; and
 
(ii)           deals in documents only and will not be concerned with the legality of a claim or any underlying transaction or any available set-off, counterclaim or other defence of any person.

61






 
(D)          The obligations of each Lender and the Borrower under this clause are continuing obligations and will extend to the ultimate balance of sums payable by that Lender or, as the case may be, the Borrower in respect of any Letter of Credit, regardless of any intermediate payment or discharge in whole or in part.
 
(E)           The obligations of a Lender or a Borrower under this clause will not be affected by any act, omission, matter or thing which, but for this clause, would reduce, release or prejudice any of its obligations under this clause (without limitation and whether or not known to it or any other person) including:
 
(i)                                  any time, waiver or consent granted to, or composition with, any Obligor, any beneficiary under a Letter of Credit or any other person;
 
(ii)                               the release of any other Obligor or any other person under the terms of any composition or arrangement;
 
(iii)                           the taking, variation, compromise, exchange, renewal or release of, or refusal or neglect to perfect, take up or enforce, any rights against, or security over assets of, any Obligor, any beneficiary under a Letter of Credit or other person or any non-presentation or non-observance of any formality or other requirement in respect of any instrument or any failure to realise the full value of any security;
 
(iv)                           any incapacity or lack of power, authority or legal personality of or dissolution or change in the members or status of an Obligor, any beneficiary under a Letter of Credit or any other person;

(ii)           the legality, validity, effectiveness, adequacy or enforceability of any Finance Document or any other agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made or executed in anticipation of, under or in connection with any Finance Document.
 
8.7          Exclusion of liability

(ii)           it becomes unlawful in any applicable jurisdiction for a Lender to perform its obligations under clause 8.4 (Indemnities) of this Agreement,
 
(any such Lender being a Relevant Lender) then, within thirty five (35) Business Days of the date of publication by S&P or Moodys of such rating downgrade or the date upon which the obligations become unlawful, the Relevant Lender shall, unless otherwise agreed by the LC Issuing Bank, as security for (but without prejudice to) its obligations under clause 8.4 (Indemnities), pay to the LC Issuing Bank an amount equal to its LC Proportion of the aggregate outstandings under all issued Letters of Credit at such date (the Cash Deposit).  The Relevant Lender shall, within thirty five (35) Business Days of any increase in such aggregate outstandings, pay to the LC Issuing Bank an amount equal to its LC Proportion of any such increase (unless otherwise agreed by the Issuing Bank) (and any additional amount so paid shall form part of the Cash Deposit).  If requested by the LC Issuing Bank, the Relevant Lender shall enter into security documentation over the Cash Deposit in form and substance satisfactory to the LC Issuing Bank (acting reasonably).
 
(B)          Any Cash Deposit made pursuant to this clause 8.10 shall be placed by the LC Issuing Bank in a separately designated bank account and shall bear interest (at the rate of interest customarily given by the LC Issuing Bank for short-term cash deposits in amounts equal to such Cash Deposit) from (and including) the date of deposit of any amounts in, until (but excluding) the date of withdrawal of any amounts from, such account (such amount held being the Borrower Replacement Collateral).
 
(C)          The LC Issuing Bank shall only withdraw amounts standing to the credit of such account:

(B)          For the purposes of paragraph (A) above, a Change of Control means any person (or persons with whom they act in concert) other than a Permitted Transferee acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 50 per cent. of the ordinary share capital in any Obligor carrying a right to vote in general meetings of that company.  For the avoidance of doubt, a Change of Control shall not occur on an IPO of any Shareholder (directly or indirectly) in KEO or the Borrower, or an IPO of any Obligor.
 
(C)          For the purposes of paragraph (B) above, any persons includes more than one person acting in concert and a Permitted Transferee means:
 
(i)            an Affiliate of a Shareholder or KEH, so long as they remain an Affiliate (including any funds associated with Warburg Pincus and Blackstone Capital Partners or the Blackstone Group); or
 
(ii)           a person who is otherwise approved by the Majority Lenders (acting reasonably) provided that any Lender which does not grant its approval may, on not less than 30 days written notice to the Facility Agent and Kosmos, demand that its participation in the Facility be prepaid in full
 
69






 
and that its Commitment be immediately cancelled, provided that Kosmos may, in accordance with paragraph (B) of clause 10.10 (Right of repayment and cancellation in relation to a single Lender), procure the replacement of that Lender or the transfer of its participation and Commitment to another Lender (with that Lenders consent) rather than such prepayment and cancellation provided that such replacement or transfer is completed within the relevant notice period given by the relevant Lender.  If such replacement or transfer does not occur within the relevant period, that Lenders participation in the Facility shall be immediately due and payable in full by the Borrower and its Commitment immediately cancelled.
 
10.7        Automatic Cancellation
 
At the close of business in London on the last Business Day of the Availability Period for the Facility, the undrawn Commitment of each Lender under the Facility at that time shall be automatically cancelled.
 
10.8        Voluntary Cancellation
 
(A)          Kosmos may, by giving not less than ten Business Days (or such shorter period as the Majority Lenders may agree) prior written notice to the Facility Agent, without penalty, cancel the undrawn Commitments under any Facility in whole or in part (but if in part, in a minimum amount of USD 1 million or, if less, the balance of the undrawn Commitments).  The relevant Commitments in respect of the Facility will be cancelled on a date specified in such notice, being a date not earlier than ten Business Days after the relevant notice is received by that Facility Agent.
 
(B)          Any valid notice of cancellation will be irrevocable and will specify the date on which the cancellation shall take effect.  No part of any Commitment which has been cancelled or which is the subject of a notice of cancellation may subsequently be utilised.
 
(C)          When any cancellation of Commitments under the Facility takes effect, each Lenders Available Commitment under the Facility will be reduced by an amount which bears the same proportion to the total amount being cancelled as its Available Commitment under the Facility bears to the Available Commitment (at that time) under the Facility.
 
10.9        Voluntary Prepayment of Loans
 
(A)          Subject to clause 10.1 (General), a Utilisation may be prepaid whether in whole or in part by the Borrower without penalty upon ten Business Days prior written notice to the Facility Agent.
 
(B)          Any valid notice of prepayment will be irrevocable and, unless a contrary indication appears in this Agreement, will specify the date on which the cancellation shall take effect.  Any amount prepaid or repaid may not be
 
70






 
redrawn if such prepayment or repayment and Utilisation occurs after the expiry of the Availability Period.
 
(C)          Prepayment shall take effect:
 
(i)            on the last day of the then current Interest Period; or
 
(ii)           on any other date subject to payment by the Borrower, on demand of Break Costs (if any), in accordance with clause 13.4 (Break Costs).
 
(D)          Unless a contrary indication appears in this Agreement, when any prepayment of the whole or part of a Loan takes place, each Lenders participation in the relevant Loan shall be reduced rateably.
 
10.10     Right of repayment and cancellation in relation to a single Lender
 
(A)          If:
 
(i)            Kosmos reasonably believes that the sum payable to any Lender by an Obligor is required to be increased under clause 15.2 (Tax gross-up);
 
(ii)           Kosmos receives a notice from the Facility Agent under clause 15.3 (Tax Indemnity) or clause 16 (Increased Costs);
 
(iii)          any Lender is or becomes a Non-Funding Lender; or
 
(iv)          any Lender is or becomes entitled to increase its rate of interest further to clause 13.2 (Market disruption),
 
Kosmos may, while (in the case of paragraphs (i) and (ii) above) the circumstance giving rise to the belief or notice continues or (in the case of (iii) or (iv) above) the relevant circumstance continues:
 
(a)           give the Facility Agent notice of cancellation of the Commitment of that Lender and its intention to procure the repayment of that Lenders participation in the Utilisations;
 
(b)           in the case of a Non-Funding Lender or Illegality Lender, give the Facility Agent notice of cancellation of the Available Commitment of that Lender in relation to the Facility and reinstate all or part of such Available Commitment in accordance with paragraph (B) below;
 
(c)           or replace that Lender in accordance with paragraph (B) below.
 
(B)          Kosmos may:
 
(i)            in the circumstances set out in paragraph (A) above or pursuant to clause 10.1 (General) or clause 10.2 (Illegality) or clause 10.6(A)(ii) (Change of Control), replace an Existing Lender (as defined in
 
71






 
clause 30 (Changes to the Lenders)), with one or more other Lenders (which need not be Existing Lenders) (each a Replacement Lender), which have agreed to purchase all or part of the Commitment and participations of that Existing Lender in Utilisations made to Kosmos pursuant to an assignment or transfer in accordance with the provisions of clause 30 (Changes to the Lenders); or
 
(ii)           in the circumstances set out in paragraph (A)(iv)(a) of this clause 10.10, cancel the Available Commitments of the Non-Funding Lender or Illegality Lender in respect of the Facility and procure that one or more Replacement Lenders assume Commitments under the Facility in an aggregate amount not exceeding the Available Commitment of the relevant Non-Funding Lender or Illegality Lender in relation to the Facility,
 
in each case on condition that:
 
(a)           each assignment or transfer under this paragraph (B) shall be arranged by Kosmos (with such reasonable assistance from the Existing Lender as Kosmos may reasonably request); and
 
(b)           no Existing Lender shall be obliged to make any assignment or transfer pursuant to this paragraph (B) unless and until it has received payment from the Replacement Lender or Replacement Lenders in an aggregate amount equal to the outstanding principal amount of the participations in the Utilisations owing to the Existing Lender, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees (including, without limitation, any Break Costs to the date of payment) and all other amounts payable to the Existing Lender under this Agreement.
 
(C)          On receipt of a notice from Kosmos referred to in paragraph (A) above, the Commitment of that Lender shall immediately be reduced to zero.
 
(D)          On the last day of each Interest Period which ends after Kosmos has given notice under paragraph (A) above (or, if earlier, the date specified by Kosmos in that notice), Kosmos shall repay that Lenders participation in the relevant Utilisation.
 
(E)           Paragraphs (A) and (B) do not in any way limit the obligations of any Finance Party under clause 18.1 (Mitigation).
 
11.          Interest
 
11.1       Calculation of interest
 
The rate of interest on each Loan for each Interest Period is the percentage rate per annum which is the aggregate of the applicable:
 
(A)          Margin;
 
72






 
(B)          LIBOR; and
 
(C)          Mandatory Cost (if any).
 
11.2        Margin
 
The Margin applicable to a Loan shall be a percentage per annum as follows:
 



 
Years (counting from and including the year   of the Effective Date)
     

 
Applicable Margin       


  1   to 4 (inclusive)
     

3.25%
        


  5   to 6 (inclusive)    

3.75%
        


  7   to Final Maturity Date (inclusive)    

4.50%
          
 
11.3        Payment of interest
 
The Borrower shall pay accrued interest on each Loan on the last day of each Interest Period (and, if the Interest Period is longer than six months, on the dates falling at six-monthly intervals after the first day of the Interest Period).
 
11.4        Default interest
 
(A)          If an Obligor fails to pay any amount payable by it under a Finance Document on its due date, interest shall accrue on the overdue amount from the due date up to the date of actual payment (both before and after judgment) at a rate which, subject to paragraph (B) below, is 1.0 per cent. higher than the rate which would have been payable if the overdue amount had, during the period of non payment, constituted a Loan in the currency of the overdue amount for successive Interest Periods, each of a duration selected by the Facility Agent (acting reasonably).  Any interest accruing under this clause shall be immediately payable by the Obligor on demand by that Facility Agent.
 
(B)          If any overdue amount consists of all or part of a Loan which became due on a day which was not the last day of an Interest Period relating to that Loan:
 
(i)            the first Interest Period for that overdue amount shall have a duration equal to the unexpired portion of the current Interest Period relating to that Loan; and
 
(ii)           the rate of interest applying to the overdue amount during that first Interest Period shall be 1.0 per cent. higher than the rate which would have applied if the overdue amount had not become due.
 
73







 
(C)          Default interest (if unpaid) arising on an overdue amount will be compounded with the overdue amount at the end of each Interest Period applicable to that overdue amount but will remain immediately due and payable.
 
11.5        Notification of rates of interest
 
The Facility Agent shall promptly notify the relevant Lenders and Kosmos of the determination of a rate of interest under this Agreement.
 
12.          Interest Periods
 
12.1        Selection of Interest Periods
 
(A)          The Borrower shall select an Interest Period for a Loan in the Utilisation Request for that Loan.
 
(B)          Subject to this clause, the Borrower may select an Interest Period of 1, 3 or 6 months or such other period as may be agreed between Kosmos and the Facility Agent (acting on behalf of the Majority Lenders).
 
(C)          No Interest Period for a Loan under the Facility shall extend beyond the Final Maturity Date.
 
(D)          The first Interest Period of each Loan shall commence on the Utilisation Date and end on the same day as the end of the selected Interest Period.  In the case of each Loan (other than the first Loan under the Facility), each subsequent Interest Period shall end on the same day as the current Interest Period of any outstanding Loan made under the Facility.
 
12.2        Non-Business Days
 
If an Interest Period ends on a day which is not a Business Day, that Interest Period will instead end on the next Business Day, unless the next Business Day is in another month, in which case the Interest Period will end on the preceding Business Day.
 
12.3        Consolidation and division of Loans
 
(A)          Subject to paragraph (B) below, if two or more Interest Periods for Loans under the Facility end on the same date, those Loans will, unless Kosmos specifies to the contrary in the Utilisation Request or in a notice to the Facility Agent, be consolidated into, and treated as, a single Loan under the Facility on the last day of the Interest Period.
 
(B)          If Kosmos requests (in either a Utilisation Request or otherwise in a notice to the Facility Agent) that a Loan be divided into two or more Loans, that Loan will, on the last day of its Interest Period, be so divided into the amounts specified in such request, being an aggregate amount equal to the amount of the Loan immediately before its division.
 
74






 
13.          Changes to the Calculation of Interest
 
13.1        Absence of quotations
 
Subject to clause 13.2 (Market disruption), if LIBOR is to be determined by reference to the Reference Banks but up to four Reference Banks do not supply a quotation by the Specified Time, the applicable LIBOR shall be determined on the basis of the quotations of the remaining Reference Banks.
 
13.2        Market disruption
 
(A)          If a Market Disruption Event occurs in relation to a Loan for any Interest Period, then the rate of interest on each Lenders share of that Loan for the Interest Period shall be the percentage rate per annum which is the sum of:
 
(i)            the Margin;
 
(ii)           the rate notified to the Facility Agent by that Lender as soon as practicable and in any event before interest is due to be paid in respect of that Interest Period, to be that which expresses as a percentage rate per annum the cost to that Lender of funding its participation in that Loan from whatever source it may reasonably select; and
 
(iii)          the Mandatory Cost, if any, applicable to that Lenders participation in the Loan.
 
(B)          In this Agreement Market Disruption Event means if, on or about noon in London on the Quotation Day for the relevant Interest Period none or only one of the Reference Banks supplies a rate to the Facility Agent to determine LIBOR for the Interest Period, or the Facility Agent receives notifications from a Lender or Lenders (whose participations exceed 35 per cent. in aggregate of all participations) that the cost to it of obtaining matching deposits in the London interbank market would be materially in excess of LIBOR.
 
(C)          The Facility Agent shall notify Kosmos immediately upon receiving notice from the Lender(s).
 
13.3        Alternative basis of interest or funding
 
(A)          If a Market Disruption Event occurs and the Facility Agent or the Borrower so requires, the Facility Agent and the Borrower shall enter into negotiations (for a period of not more than thirty days) with a view to agreeing a substitute basis for determining the rate of interest.
 
(B)          Any alternative basis agreed pursuant to paragraph (A) above shall, with the prior consent of all the Lenders and Kosmos, be binding on all Parties.
 
75






 
13.4        Break Costs
 
(A)          Kosmos shall, within three Business Days of demand by a Finance Party, pay to that Finance Party its Break Costs attributable to all or any part of a Loan or Unpaid Sum being paid by it on a day other than the last day of an Interest Period for that Loan or Unpaid Sum.
 
(B)          Each Lender shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after a demand by the Facility Agent, provide a certificate confirming the amount of its Break Costs for any Interest Period in which they accrue.
 
(C)          If, following a payment by Kosmos of all or part of a Loan or Unpaid Sum on a day other than the last day of an Interest Period for that Loan or Unpaid Sum, a Lender realises a profit, and no Event of Default is continuing, that Lender must pay an amount equal to that profit to Kosmos as soon as practicable.
 
13.5        FATCA Information
 
(A)          Subject to paragraph (C) below, each Party shall, within ten Business Days of a reasonable request by another Party:
 
(i)            confirm to that other Party whether it is:
 
(a)           a FATCA Exempt Party; or
 
(b)           not a FATCA Exempt Party; and
 
(ii)           supply to that other Party such forms, documentation and other information relating to its status under FATCA (including its applicable passthru payment percentage or other information required under the US Treasury Regulations or other official guidance including intergovernmental agreements) as that other Party reasonably requests for the purposes of that other Partys compliance with FATCA.
 
(B)          If a Party confirms to another Party pursuant to clause 13.5(A)(i)(a) above that it is a FATCA Exempt Party and it subsequently becomes aware that it is not, or has ceased to be a FATCA Exempt Party, that Party shall notify that other Party reasonably promptly.
 
(C)          Paragraph (A) above shall not oblige any Finance Party to do anything which would or might in its reasonable opinion constitute a breach of:
 
(i)            any law or regulation;
 
(ii)           any fiduciary duty; or
 
(iii)          any duty of confidentiality.
 
76






 
(D)          If a Party fails to confirm its status or to supply forms, documentation or other information requested in accordance with paragraph (A) above (including, for the avoidance of doubt, where paragraph (C) above applies), then:
 
(i)            if that Party failed to confirm whether it is (and/or remains) a FATCA Exempt Party then such Party shall be treated for the purposes of the Finance Documents as if it is not a FATCA Exempt Party; and
 
(ii)           if that Party failed to confirm its applicable passthru payment percentage then such Party shall be treated for the purposes of the Finance Documents (and payments made thereunder) as if its applicable passthru payment percentage is 100%,
 
until (in each case) such time as the Party in question provides the requested confirmation, forms, documentation or other information.
 
14.          Fees
 
14.1        Commitment fee
 
(A)          The Borrower shall pay to the Facility Agent in respect of the Non-IFC Facility for the account of each Lender (other than IFC) and in respect of the IFC Facility to IFC directly for the account of IFC, a fee computed as follows:
 
(i)            when Commitment is available for utilisation, at a rate equal to 40 per cent. per annum of the then applicable Margin; and
 
(ii)           when Commitment is not then available for utilisation, at a rate equal to 20 per cent. per annum of the then applicable Margin.

(i)            in respect of the Non-IFC Facility, the date of this Agreement until and including the last day of the Availability Period; and
 
(ii)           in respect of the IFC Facility, the date of the IFC Facility Agreement until and including the last day of the Availability Period.
 
(C)          Notwithstanding paragraphs (A) and (B) above, the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such commitment fees to the Facility Agent for the account of any Lender in respect of a Non-IFC Facility and to IFC for the account of IFC in respect of the IFC Facility in each case during the period in which such Lender is a Non-Funding Lender.
 
14.2        Front end and underwriting fees

15.1        Definitions
 
In this Agreement:
 
Tax Credit means a credit against, relief or remission for, or repayment of any Tax.
 
Tax Deduction means a deduction or withholding for or on account of Tax from a payment under a Finance Document, other than a FATCA Deduction.
 
Tax Payment means either the increase in a payment made by an Obligor to a Finance Party under clause 15.2 (Tax gross-up) or a payment under clause 15.3 (Tax Indemnity).

(B)          Kosmos shall promptly upon becoming aware that an Obligor must make a Tax Deduction (or that there is any change in the rate or the basis of a Tax Deduction) notify the Facility Agent accordingly.
 
(C)          If a Tax Deduction is required by law to be made by an Obligor, the amount of the payment due from that Obligor shall be increased to an amount which (after making any Tax Deduction) leaves an amount equal to the payment which would have been due if no Tax Deduction had been required.
 
(D)          If an Obligor is required to make a Tax Deduction, that Obligor shall make that Tax Deduction and any payment required in connection with that Tax Deduction within the time allowed and in the minimum amount required by law.
 
(E)           Within thirty days of making either a Tax Deduction or any payment required in connection with that Tax Deduction, the Obligor making that Tax Deduction shall deliver to the Facility Agent for the Finance Party entitled to the payment evidence reasonably satisfactory to that Finance Party (acting reasonably) that the Tax Deduction has been made or (as applicable) any appropriate payment paid to the relevant taxing Authority.

79






 
15.3        Tax Indemnity

(B)          Paragraph (A) above shall not apply:
 
(i)            with respect to any Tax assessed on a Finance Party under the law of the jurisdiction in which:
 
(a)           that Finance Party is incorporated or, if different, the jurisdiction (or jurisdictions) in which that Finance Party is treated as resident for tax purposes; or
 
(b)           that Finance Partys Facility Office is located in respect of amounts received or receivable in that jurisdiction,
 
if in either such case that Tax is imposed on or calculated by reference to the net income received or receivable (but not any sum deemed to be received or receivable) by that Finance Party or that Finance Partys Facility Office; or
 
(ii)           to the extent a loss, liability or cost is compensated for by an increased payment under clause 15.2 (Tax gross-up); or
 
(iii)          to the extent a loss, liability or cost relates to a FATCA Deduction required to be made by a Party; or
 
(iv)          with respect to any Tax assessed prior to the date which is 180 days prior to the date on which the relevant Finance Party requests such a payment from the Borrower, unless a determination of the amount claimed could only be made on or after the first of those dates.
 
(C)          A Finance Party making, or intending to make a claim under paragraph (A) above shall promptly notify the Facility Agent of the event which will give, or has given, rise to the claim, following which the Facility Agent shall provide to Kosmos a copy of the notification by such Finance Party.

80






 
15.4        Tax Credit
 
(A)          If:-
 
(i)            an Obligor makes a Tax Payment, and
 
(ii)           a Tax Credit is attributable either to an increased payment of which that Tax Payment forms part, or to that Tax Payment, and
 
(iii)          that Finance Party has obtained, utilised and retained that Tax Credit,
 
the Finance Party shall pay an amount to the Obligor which that Finance Party reasonably determines will leave it (after that payment) in the same after-Tax position as it would have been in but for its utilisation of the Tax Credit.
 
(B)          Nothing in this clause will:
 
(i)            interfere with the rights of any Finance Party to arrange its affairs in whatever manner it thinks fit; or

(B)          Where a Finance Document requires any Party to reimburse a Finance Party for any costs or expenses, that obligation shall be deemed to extend to all VAT incurred by the Finance Party in respect of the costs or expenses to the extent that the Finance Party reasonably determines that neither the Finance Party nor any other member of any VAT group of which it is a member is entitled to credit or repayment of the VAT.
 
81

(B)          Each Party shall promptly, upon becoming aware that it must make a FATCA Deduction (or that there is any change in the rate or the basis of such FATCA Deduction), notify the Party to whom it is making the payment and, in addition, shall notify Kosmos, the Facility Agent and the other Finance Parties.
 
16.          Increased Costs
 
16.1        Increased costs
 
(A)          Subject to clause 16.3 (Exceptions) the Borrower shall, within five Business Days of a demand by the Facility Agent, pay for the account of a Finance Party the amount of any Increased Costs incurred by that Finance Party or any of its Affiliates as a result of the introduction of or any change in (or in the interpretation, administration or application by any governmental body or regulatory Authority of) any law or regulation (whether or not having the force of law, but if not, being of a type with which that Finance Party or Affiliate is expected or required to comply), or as a result of the implementation or application of, or compliance with, Basel III or any law or regulation that implements or applies Basel III.

(B)          Each Finance Party shall provide a certificate confirming the amount of its Increased Costs.
 
16.3        Exceptions
 
(A)          clause 16.1 (Increased costs) does not apply to the extent any Increased Cost is:

(ii)           attributable to a FATCA Deduction required to be made by a Party;
 
(iii)          the subject of a claim under clause 15.3 (Tax Indemnity) (or might be or have been the subject of a claim under clause 15.3 (Tax Indemnity) but for any of the exclusions in paragraph (B) of clause 15.3 (Tax Indemnity));
 
(iv)          incurred prior to the date which is 180 days prior to the date on which the Finance Party makes a claim in accordance with clause 16.2 (Increased cost claims), unless a determination of the amount incurred could only be made on or after the first of those dates;
 
(v)           any of the types of cost dealt with by Schedule 6 (Mandatory Cost Formulae);

PART 6 FORECASTS AND CALCULATIONS AND BORROWING BASE AMOUNT
 
19.          Forecasts and Calculations
 
19.1        Forecast Procedures
 
(A)          Not less than 30 Business Days before any proposed or required Forecast Date, the Borrower, the Facility Agent and the Technical and Modelling Bank shall consult together with a view to preparing and agreeing the relevant Forecast including the Forecast Assumptions and all associated calculations and information. Kosmos shall ensure that a new or updated reserves report is prepared by the Reserves Consultant for the Forecast prepared for 15 June 2011 and for each Forecast prepared on subsequent Forecast Dates falling at twelve monthly intervals (or such earlier dates as Kosmos may elect).  Each party shall consult in good faith and act reasonably, and shall make available sufficiently experienced personnel, with a view to reaching agreement as soon as reasonably practicable.  Each Forecast (and all Forecast Assumptions used) shall have due and proper regard to any reasonable view expressed by any of the Consultants in a report delivered for the purpose of preparing the Forecast, any plan of development, work program and budget and the provisions and requirements of the Project Agreements (and any updates thereto).  Any product pricing proposal by the Technical and Modelling Bank shall be reasonable in the circumstances and shall be made in accordance with current business practices, applied on a consistent, reasonable and non-discriminatory basis and reflecting market practice at the time.  The price of Crude Oil will be subject to a floor which will be, for the Forecast to be prepared on 31 March, 2014, USD70/bbl, and thereafter will be determined subject to and in accordance with the Forecasting Procedures, provided that the floor may not be reduced at any time to less than 70% of the average Brent Forward Curve for the next 36 months as at the date the relevant Forecast is prepared.
 
(B)          The Borrower shall provide its proposed Forecast to each Lender 15 Business Days before the relevant Forecast Date and the Technical and Modelling Bank and the Facility Agent shall provide their commentary on such Forecast, including whether it agrees or disagrees with such Forecast (including, if applicable, details of the grounds for its determination not to agree with the Forecast).  Each Lender shall have 10 Business Days to approve the Forecast and, once approved by the Majority Lenders, that Forecast will apply for the relevant Forecast Period.  If any such Lender has not objected in writing to the Forecast within such 10 Business Day period, then such Lender shall be deemed to have approved the Forecast.  A Forecast shall only be deemed to have been accepted by such Lenders if it has been approved (or deemed approved) by the Majority Lenders.  In making any objection, such Lenders must act reasonably and no objection may be made other than on the grounds that a Forecast Assumption which has been used in the Forecast is not reasonable in the circumstances, or on the grounds of proven or manifest error.
 
(C)          In making any determination in the Forecasting Procedures the Majority Lenders shall give due and proper regard to any information provided (including
 
86






 
any report delivered by the Consultants for the purposes of the Forecast) or representations made by the Borrower, the Technical and Modelling Bank and the Facility Agent.  Any determination shall take due and proper regard of any plan of development, work program and budget (and any updates thereto) and the provisions and requirements of the Project Agreements.  In making any determination in accordance with the Forecasting Procedures in relation to product prices, the price of Crude Oil will be subject to a floor which will be, for the Forecast prepared on 31 March, 2014, USD70/bbl, and thereafter will be determined subject to and in accordance with the Forecasting Procedures, provided that the floor may not be reduced at any time to less than 70% of the average Brent Forward Curve for the next 36 months as at the date the relevant Forecast is prepared. Any determination in relation to product prices shall be reasonable in the circumstances and shall be made in accordance with current business practices, applied on a consistent, reasonable and non-discriminatory basis and reflecting market practice at the time.
 
(D)          If the Majority Lenders do not approve the Forecast, the Borrower, the Technical and Modelling Bank and the Facility Agent shall prepare a revised Forecast which satisfies, in all reasonable respects, the objections of the Majority Lenders.
 
(E)           If, for any reason, a Forecast is not agreed prior to the applicable Forecast Date, the then applicable Forecast shall continue to apply until the new Forecast is prepared and agreed in accordance with the Forecast Procedures.
 
(F)           Other than Jubilee Field Phase 1, Jubilee Field Phase 1A and any other asset which has already been included as a Borrowing Base Asset at the relevant time, in order for a Ghana Block Asset to be included as a Borrowing Base Asset the following conditions must be satisfied (without prejudice to the other terms of this Agreement, including (but not limited to) the other terms of this clause 19.1):
 
(i)            the Borrower must notify the Facility Agent and the Technical Bank that the Ghana Block Asset in question is to be included as a Borrowing Base Asset, including the date for such inclusion (such date being the date specified in limb (B) of the definition of Forecast Date in clause 1.1 (Definitions));
 
(ii)           a plan of development applicable to the relevant Ghana Block Asset must have been approved in accordance with the relevant Petroleum Agreement; and
 
(iii)          not less than 30 Business Days before the proposed Forecast Date referred to in paragraph (i) above, the Borrower shall procure the preparation and delivery to the Lenders of appropriate reports from the Technical Consultant, the Environmental Consultant, the Reserves Consultant and the Insurance Consultant in relation to the relevant Ghana Block Asset.  For the avoidance of doubt, the approval by the Lenders (or any number of them) of the aforementioned reports shall not be a condition to the inclusion of the relevant Ghana Block Asset as
 
87






 
a Borrowing Base Asset.  The parties will act reasonably in negotiating any amendments to the aforementioned reports which the Majority Lenders reasonably require.
 
(G)          The Technical Bank may request the receipt of a new or updated reserves  and/or resources report regarding the Resource Bridge Assets prepared by the Reserve Consultant if it reasonably believes that such report is justified due to the fact that the Aggregate Resource Bridge Amount materially exceeds the amount which is then currently justifiable, due to recent changes to the appraisal or development results (other than to the extent caused by the fluctuation of Crude Oil prices) or due to changes made to the version of the development plan that had previously been reviewed by the Technical Bank.
 
19.2        Contents of Forecast
 
(A)          Each Forecast will set out or include:
 
(i)            the Technical Assumptions and Economic Assumptions upon which the Forecast is based (including, without limitation, on product prices);
 
(ii)           an updated Model;
 
(iii)          the calculation of the Borrowing Base Amount and, if applicable (or if the Borrower otherwise requires), a reserves and/or resources report in relation to the Aggregate Resource Bridge Amount;
 
(iv)          the calculation of any mandatory prepayment required because the aggregate of outstandings under the Facility exceeds the Borrowing Base Amount;
 
(v)           calculations of the Field Life Cover Ratio and the Loan Life Cover Ratio;
 
(vi)          the calculation of the Reserve Tail Date;
 
(vii)         (a)          the aggregate economically recoverable proved (1P) reserves and the proved and probable (2P) reserves remaining to be produced from the Borrowing Base Assets (reflecting any updated reserves report produced by the Reserves Consultant in respect of that Forecast, or if no such updated reserves report has been produced, reflecting the immediately preceding reserves report as may be updated by Kosmos with the agreement of the Technical Consultant and the Technical and Modelling Bank (acting reasonably);
 
(b)           the aggregate remaining best estimate contingent (2C) reserves and the proved and probable (2P) reserves remaining to be produced from the Resource Bridge Assets (reflecting any updated reserves and/or resources report produced by the Reserves Consultant in respect of that Forecast;
 
88






 
(viii)        the revised Amortisation Schedule (if required) or confirmation that no revision to the Amortisation Schedule is required pursuant to clause 9.2 (Amendment to Amortisation Schedule); and
 
(ix)          such other reasonable information as the Technical and Modelling Bank or the Facility Agent may reasonably require.
 
(B)          All projections and calculations to be made under this clause shall be expressed and made in US Dollars (at the Facility Agents spot rate of exchange at the time if so required (which the Facility Agent will provide promptly on request)).
 
19.3        New Borrowing Base Assets
 
Whenever a new asset becomes, or is to become, a Borrowing Base Asset, a new Forecast must first be prepared and provided to each Lender, in accordance with this clause 19 (Forecasts and Calculations), together with a Sources and Uses Statement, including that asset.
 
19.4        Manner of Calculations
 
(A)          All the calculations required for each Forecast will be calculated using the Model on the basis of the Technical Assumptions and Economic Assumptions determined for the purposes of that Forecast.
 
(B)          Where the manner of determining any of the calculations required for a Forecast differs between the programme on which the Model operates and the provisions of the Finance Documents, the Finance Documents will prevail.
 
19.5        Borrowing Base Amount
 
(A)          The Borrowing Base Amount shall be determined on each Forecast Date pursuant to a Forecast prepared in accordance with the Forecasting Procedures.  The Borrowing Base Amount so determined shall apply for the duration of the next succeeding Forecast Period or until a new Forecast is prepared.
 
(B)          Notwithstanding the fact that:
 
(i)            Jubilee Field Phase 2;
 
(ii)           the TEN Development and Production Area; and
 
(iii)          the MTA Reserves,
 
are not Borrowing Base Assets, the Borrowing Base Amount:
 
(iv)          shall be increased (in relation to Jubilee Field Phase 2 and the TEN Development and Production Area); and
 
89






 
(v)           may be increased (in relation to the MTA Reserves, with the consent of the Majority Lenders, acting reasonably),
 
by an amount equal to USD 5.00 per barrel of Crude Oil from the proved and probable (2P) reserves and the best estimate contingent (2C) resources, each as determined by reference to the latest reserves and/or resources report prepared by the Reserves Consultant (the Resource Bridge Reserves) (at any time such amount, the Aggregate Resource Bridge Amount).
 
(C)          At no time shall:
 
(i)            the Aggregate Resource Bridge Amount exceed USD 350 million in any Forecast (or, if less, the amount of the Aggregate Resource Bridge Amount as set out in column 5 of the table in Schedule 5 (Amortisation Schedule)); or
 
(ii)           the sum of the Borrowing Base Amount (including the Aggregate Resource Bridge Amount) exceed the Revised Facility Total as shown in column 3 of Schedule 5 (Amortisation Schedule).
 
(D)          For the avoidance of doubt, when reserves for Jubilee Field Phase 2, the TEN Development and Production Area and/or the MTA Discovery Areas become Borrowing Base Assets (whether proved (1P) reserves or proved and probable (2P) reserves), then clause 19.5(B) shall cease to apply in respect of the relevant Resource Bridge Reserves which shall thereafter be treated as a Borrowing Base Asset and included in the calculation of the Borrowing Base Amount subject to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (but without prejudice to the application of this clause to any remaining Resource Bridge Reserves which are not Borrowing Base Assets at the relevant time).
 
19.6        Calculation of Borrowing Base Amount
 
(A)          The Borrowing Base Amount for the purposes of the Facility shall be the lesser of:
 
(i)            the sum of: (a) the net present value of Net Cash Flow until the Field Depletion Date plus (b) the net present value of Relevant Capital Expenditure, divided by 1.4;
 
(ii)           the sum of: (a) the net present value of Net Cash Flow until the Final Maturity Date plus (b) the net present value of Relevant Capital Expenditure, divided by 1.15,
 
plus the amount determined in accordance with clause 19.5(B), provided that it does not breach Clause 19.5(C).
 
(B)          The discount rate utilised to determine the net present values referred to in paragraph (A) above shall be eight per cent. and shall be applied in calculating the net present value of cash flows.
 
90






 
19.7        Model
 
(A)          The Facility Agent, the Technical and Modelling Bank and Kosmos may each make proposals with regard to amendments to the Model which it believes:
 
(i)            in good faith are required for the purpose of correcting any manifest error in the form or structure of the Model; or
 
(ii)           to incorporate additional assumptions.
 
(B)          If the Facility Agent, Technical and Modelling Bank and Kosmos are unable to agree on the required changes to the Model within 15 Business Days from the date on which such changes were proposed, then the matter shall, on the request of Kosmos or the Technical and Modelling Bank, or on the initiation of the Facility Agent, be referred for resolution to an appropriate expert appointed by the Facility Agent (being a person having appropriate independent expertise with respect to, but no interest in, the outcome of the matter referred to it).
 
(C)          The costs of any references to an expert and the costs, if any, incurred in giving effect to any agreed revision to the Model will be borne by Kosmos except, in the case of the costs of any reference to an expert only, if the expert determines that any proposal by the Technical and Modelling Bank or the Facility Agent in respect of the changes to the Model which are in dispute could not be regarded as reasonable and are rejected by such expert, in which case such costs shall be borne by the Lenders.
 
(D)          Any amendments to the Model will not be made until such time as such amendment has been agreed or determined (as appropriate) pursuant to paragraphs (A) and (B) above.  Prior to such amendment being incorporated into the Model, the Model will continue to be utilised without such amendment.
 
(E)           Where the manner of determining any of the calculations required for a Forecast is amended as a consequence of any amendments made to the Model, the Finance Documents shall be deemed to be amended to reflect any such amendment.
 
19.8        Approved Developments and Permitted Acquisitions
 
Prior to requesting the consent of the Majority Lenders to the carrying out of any Approved Development (or the inclusion of any Field or Petroleum Asset (or any part thereof) in the Borrowing Base Assets as an Approved Development) or to the making of any Permitted Acquisition, the Technical and Modelling Bank and the Borrower shall consult in good faith, and acting reasonably, they shall prepare a proposal for the consideration of each Lender which includes all relevant information for the Lenders to make an informed decision on whether to grant the requisite consent (including appropriate reports from the Technical Consultant, the Environmental Consultant, the Reserves Consultant and the Insurance Consultant).  Any Approved Development or Permitted Acquisition must be compliant with the Equator Principles (as confirmed by the Environmental Consultant).  The Technical and Modelling Bank shall include its recommendation with the proposal on whether consent should be given.  In considering
 
91






 
whether to grant any such consent, the Lenders shall act reasonably and shall take due and proper regard of any recommendation of the Technical and Modelling Bank (but without any liability on the part of the Technical and Modelling Bank and each Lender being deemed to make its own independent assessment) and the information provided with the proposal.  If the Majority Lenders refuse their consent, they shall provide the Borrower with reasonable details of the reasons why they have refused their consent.  A Permitted Acquisition may not take place in Iran, Libya, Myanmar, North Korea, Sudan, Syria, Cuba, any country which is on a sanctions list issued by the United States, the European Union (or any member state) or the United Nations or any country designated by the Majority Lenders (acting reasonably).

20.                              Bank Accounts and Cash Management
 
20.1                       Project Accounts
 
(A)                             (i)                                    Each Obligor shall establish and maintain each of the Project Accounts, as required under the terms of this Agreement, with the Account Bank in London or such other jurisdiction approved by the Facility Agent (acting reasonably).
 
(ii)                               Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any other Finance Document KEO may maintain and operate such bank accounts (which are not Project Accounts) as it, in its discretion, sees fit and may, subject to clause 28.26(B)(C), receive and make withdrawals from any such account without restriction.  Any amounts standing to the credit of any such account shall not be subordinated to the rights of the Lenders and shall not be available to the Finance Parties whether as secured or unsecured creditors of Kosmos and irrespective of whether an Event of Default has occurred.  KEO may grant security over any such account in favour of any person and shall not be required to grant any Security Interest in favour of the Finance Parties.
 
(B)                               The Project Accounts (other than the Ghana Working Capital Cedi Account which shall be denominated in Ghanaian Cedi) shall be denominated in US Dollars.  Any sum constituting interest paid in respect of the credit balance on any Project Account shall be treated in the same manner as any other sum credited to a Project Account.
 
(C)                               Each Project Account will be a separate account at the Account Bank.  The Project Accounts will be maintained until the Discharge Date.
 
(D)                               Amounts may be deposited into the Onshore Working Capital Accounts, to the extent necessary, to meet local onshore payments only, provided that the aggregate balance in such accounts may not exceed USD 10 million (or equivalent) or such higher amount agreed by the Facility Agent (acting reasonably).
 
(E)                                Subject to paragraph (D) above and to the order of payments provided for in the Cash Waterfall, Kosmos shall maintain the balance of the Offshore Proceeds Accounts and the Onshore Working Capital Accounts, which, when aggregated and taken together with amounts paid in advance for its liabilities under the Project Agreements, is prudent and reasonable.
 
20.2                       Other bank accounts
 
(A)                               Each Obligor (but excluding KEO for these purposes) shall not open or maintain any bank accounts other than:
 
93






 
(i)                                      the Project Accounts (including such other accounts established by KEG with the Account Bank which would be Project Accounts but for the execution of the Onshore Security Assignment and the Offshore Security Assignment by all the parties thereto in accordance with this Agreement), which shall not be overdrawn at any time and any withdrawals from such Project Accounts shall only be made out of cleared funds;
 
(ii)                                   the Distributions Reserve Accounts, which shall not be overdrawn at any time; and
 
(iii)                                such accounts as may be necessary or appropriate for it to perform its obligations as an operator in relation to the Ghana Blocks and, except into which moneys received from, or for the account of, any other party may be paid as required (but any money being related to any carried interest (including in respect of the carried interest of EO) in relation to any Borrowing Base Asset shall be paid into an Offshore Proceeds Account) (an Interested Third Party),
 
provided that in no event shall such accounts referred to in (ii) and (iii) above, or any moneys standing to the credit of such accounts referred to in (ii) and (iii) above, be available to the Lenders (except on an unsecured basis following the occurrence of any of the events described in clause 29.6 (Insolvency) and/or clause 29.7 (Insolvency proceedings)) or subject to any restrictions under the Finance Documents and shall not be subject to any Security Interest in favour of any Finance Party (but may be secured in favour of any other person other than the Finance Parties).
 
(B)                               The Lenders will account to KEH and/or the relevant Obligor if and to the extent they receive any proceeds from any account of KEO (which is not a Project Account) as referred to in clause 20.1(A) or any other account referred to in 20.2(A)(ii) or (A)(iii) above, and shall hold any such moneys to the account of, and on trust for, KEH or, as the case may be, KEO.
 
(C)                               Any Lender that is in receipt of proceeds as described in paragraph (B) above shall:
 
(i)                                      within five Business Days notify details of the receipt or recovery to Kosmos, KEH and the Facility Agent; and
 
(ii)                                   within five Business Days of demand by KEH or KEO, pay an amount equal to such receipt or recovery to KEH or, as the case may be, KEO.
 
20.3                      Appointment of Account Bank
 
(A)                               Any appointment of or change to the Account Bank will become effective only upon the Account Bank executing, or new Account Bank acceding to the terms of, the Project Accounts Agreements or such other terms as may be approved by Kosmos and the Facility Agent (acting reasonably).
 
94






 
(B)                               Kosmos may, with the consent of the Facility Agent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), change the Account Bank to another bank which meets the requirements of paragraph (C) below, but subject to paragraph (A) above and clause 20.1 (Project Accounts).  If the Account Bank resigns, then Kosmos will appoint a replacement Account Bank which meets the requirements of paragraph (C), but subject to paragraph (A) and clause 20.1 (Project Accounts).
 
(C)                               Each Account Bank shall be a bank whose long-term unguaranteed, unsecured securities or debt has a rating of A- or higher from Standard and Poors or A3 or higher from Moodys (or equivalent) or such lower rating as the Facility Agent and Kosmos shall agree in writing.
 
20.4                       Security Documents and Project Accounts Agreements
 
(A)                               The Project Accounts shall be subject to a first ranking Security Interest in favour of the Secured Parties.  Kosmos shall forthwith upon any change to the Account Bank, or upon opening any Project Account which is not subject to the security constituted by the relevant Security Documents, execute and deliver to the Security Agent such supplemental Security Documents as the Security Agent and the Facility Agent may reasonably require in order to create a first priority Security Interest over that Project Account in favour of the Finance Parties.  Such supplemental Security Documents must be in a form and in substance satisfactory to the Facility Agent and the Security Agent.
 
(B)                               Kosmos shall, before any Project Account is opened, procure that the Obligor and the Account Bank have entered into the Project Accounts Agreements.
 
(C)                               In the case of execution of any of the Security Documents and Project Accounts Agreements referred to in paragraphs (A) and (B) above, Kosmos shall deliver to the Facility Agent documents which are the equivalent of those referred to in paragraph 1 of Schedule 3 (Conditions Precedent) in respect of such Security Documents and Project Accounts Agreements, together with any legal opinions which the Facility Agent may reasonably require, such legal opinions to be provided at the reasonable expense of Kosmos.  All such documents must be in a form and in substance satisfactory to the Facility Agent.
 
(D)                               The detailed operating procedures for the Project Accounts will be agreed between Kosmos and the Account Bank, but in the event of any inconsistency between those procedures and the Project Accounts Agreements or this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall prevail.
 
20.5                       Control on withdrawals following Default
 
If a Default has occurred and is continuing and has not been waived, no Obligor may withdraw any moneys from the Project Accounts except:
 
(A)                               with the prior consent of the Facility Agent;
 
(B)                               to meet an Obligors payment obligations under the Finance Documents (but not any payment obligations owed to any Junior Finance Party or the Proceeds
 
95






 
Agent, each as defined in the KEFI Intercreditor Agreement) or the Project Agreements on the relevant due date; or
 
(C)                               to pay for Project Costs not included in paragraph (B) above where:
 
(i)                                      the payment in question has been budgeted for and the Facility Agent have given their written consent to the relevant expenditure or cost being incurred; or
 
(ii)                                   the failure to make the payment in question would materially and adversely affect the business or financial condition of Kosmos or any other Obligor.
 
20.6                       Distributions Reserve Account
 
(A)                               Each Obligor may maintain a Distributions Reserve Account into which the amount of any permitted distribution under clause 28.23 (Distributions), permitted indebtedness (other than drawdowns under the Facility) and contributions to the capital of an Obligor may be credited subject to compliance with the Cash Waterfall and such amounts shall not be subordinated to the rights of the Lenders.  Amounts standing to the credit of the Distributions Reserve Accounts shall not be available to the Finance Parties whether as secured or unsecured creditors of Kosmos and irrespective of whether an Event of Default has occurred.  The Obligors may grant security over their Distributions Reserve Account in favour of any person and shall not be required to grant any Security Interest over the Distributions Reserve Account in favour of the Finance Parties.  Sums standing to the credit of the Distributions Reserve Accounts may be withdrawn and applied as the Obligor sees fit.
 
(B)                               The Lenders will account to KEH and/or the relevant Obligor if and to the extent they receive any proceeds from a Distributions Reserve Account or any account of KEO (which is not a Project Account), and shall hold any such moneys to the account of, and on trust for, KEH or, as the case may be, KEO.  If any other person has a Security Interest or claim against amounts standing to the credit of a Distributions Reserve Account, any such interest or claim shall be limited to these amounts and they shall not have recourse to the assets of any Obligor generally, nor shall they be entitled to make any claim or enforce against, or initiate any Insolvency Proceedings of any kind, against any Obligor.
 
(C)                               Any Lender that is in receipt of proceeds as described in paragraph (B) above, shall turnover such proceeds to KEH or, as the case may be, KEO in accordance with paragraph (C) of clause 20.2 (Other bank accounts) above.
 
21.                              Operation of the Offshore Proceeds Accounts
 
21.1                       Payments in
 
Unless a Finance Document expressly requires an amount to be paid into any other Project Account, each Obligor must ensure that:
 
96






 
(A)                               all Gross Revenues and Resource Bridge Assets Revenues received;
 
(B)                               the proceeds of any Loan or amounts received under an Intercompany Loan Agreement pursuant to clauses 5.1(D), 21.2(a)(ii) and 21.2(a)(iii);
 
(C)                               the proceeds of repayment of any loan made pursuant to any FPSO Construction Financing;
 
(D)                               the proceeds of any Permitted Disposals; and
 
(E)                                any other amount payable to, or received by an Obligor (including payments received under any offtake contract (and the Obligors shall direct any person making such payments that any such payment shall be paid into that account only)), but excluding any amount which may be:
 
(i)                                      credited to the Distribution Reserve Account of Kosmos;
 
(ii)                                   lent to an Obligor under an Intercompany Loan Agreement pursuant to clause 21.2(A)(viii); or
 
(iii)                                credited to an account of KEO (which is not a Project Account),
 
are paid directly into an Offshore Proceeds Account.
 
21.2                       Withdrawals  No Default Outstanding
 
(A)                               Unless otherwise provided and unless there is a Default outstanding, amounts may only be withdrawn from the Offshore Proceeds Accounts and the Onshore Working Capital Accounts (including by way of transfer to any other account) if they are applied for the following purposes and subject to the following priority:
 
(i)                                      first, payment of Project Costs provided that, if the latest Sources And Uses Statement shows that there is a shortfall in funding projected to be available, then such available funding must, unless the Majority Lenders otherwise agree, be allocated to meet costs in the following order of priority:
 
(a)                                Borrowing Base Assets;
 
(b)                                Ghana Block Assets; and
 
(c)                                 any other Project Costs.
 
In the event that there is any projected shortfall in funding, then the Facility may not be used for a purpose set out above unless each of the other purposes higher in the order of priority is fully funded by committed and available funding for the then applicable Forecast Period (including amounts under the Facility and assuming that there is no Default or Event of Default under the Finance Documents).
 
97






 
(ii)                                   secondly, pari passu, payment of (or the funding of an Obligor, including by way of payment under any Intercompany Loan Agreement, to enable it to pay) any Financing Costs (excluding any payments of principal) under the Facility due but unpaid (applied to overdue amounts first, unpaid fees second, and unpaid interest third) or scheduled payments due but unpaid under a Hedging Agreement;
 
(iii)                                thirdly, pari passu, payments of (or the funding of an Obligor, including by way of payment under any Intercompany Loan Agreement to enable it to pay) principal under the Facility due but unpaid (applied to overdue amounts first and then to unpaid principal payments) and payment of (or the funding of the Borrower, including by way of payment under any Intercompany Loan Agreement to enable it to pay) any liabilities, including any early termination payment, due but unpaid under a Hedging Agreement;
 
(iv)                               fourthly, payment of any mandatory prepayments required because the outstandings under the Facility exceed the Borrowing Base Amount as determined by the most recent Forecast;
 
(v)                                  fifthly, payment of Scheduled KEL Debt Payments which are made by way of a Scheduled KEL Debt Payment Distribution;
 
(vi)                               sixthly, payments required to be made into the DSRA up to the Required Balance;
 
(vii)                            seventhly, prepayments under the Finance Documents and/or providing cash collateral under any Letter of Credit; and
 
(viii)                         lastly, so long as the Dividend Release Test is met, to make distributions to its shareholders at the Borrowers discretion, which shall include making payments to the Distribution Reserve Account and payments under any Intercompany Loan Agreement provided that the amount distributed shall be based on the aggregate amount standing to the credit of the Offshore Proceeds Accounts on the relevant payment date after the amounts in (i) to (vi) above have been deducted.
 
22.                              Debt Service Reserve Account
 
22.1                       Funding of Debt Service Reserve Account
 
(A)                               Kosmos shall ensure on an ongoing basis that deposits are made into the Debt Service Reserve Account in accordance with the Cash Waterfall until the balance of such account is not less than the Required Balance.  The funding of the Debt Service Reserve Account shall continue in accordance with the Cash Waterfall until the Discharge Date.
 
(B)                               Failure to maintain the Required Balance standing to the credit of the Debt Service Reserve Account shall not constitute an Event of Default for the purposes of clause 29 (Events of Default), but failure to apply amounts from the
 
98






 
Project Accounts during the relevant Forecast Period in accordance with the Cash Waterfall shall constitute an Event of Default for the purposes of clause 29 (Events of Default).
 
(C)                               Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (A) and (B) above, Kosmos may (without being restricted by the Cash Waterfall) make a Utilisation under the Facility to fund the Debt Service Reserve Account.
 
22.2                       Withdrawals from Debt Service Reserve Account
 
(A)                               Subject to paragraph (B) below, amounts standing to the credit of the Debt Service Reserve Account may be withdrawn only to pay any Financing Costs under the Facility and to make Scheduled KEL Debt Payments in accordance with the Cash Waterfall.
 
(B)                               In addition, withdrawals may be made from the Debt Service Reserve Account to the extent the amount withdrawn is equal to or less than the amount (if any) by which the amount standing to the credit of the Debt Service Reserve Account exceeds the applicable Required Balance at that time.  Any such withdrawal may be applied in accordance with, and for the purposes set out in, the Cash Waterfall.
 
23.                              Authorised Investments
 
23.1                       Power of investment
 
Subject always to clause 20.1 (Project Accounts), Kosmos may require that such part of the amounts standing to the credit of any of the Project Accounts as it may consider prudent (having reasonable grounds for so considering) shall be invested from time to time in Authorised Investments in accordance with this clause and in a manner consistent with the provisions of clause 28.17(A) (Hedging).
 
23.2                       Type of investment
 
(A)                               Kosmos shall use its reasonable endeavours to procure that there are maintained from time to time a prudent spread of Authorised Investments and that the maturity of Authorised Investments is such that they can be liquidated to enable all payment obligations under the Finance Documents to be met on the due date.
 
(B)                               If any Authorised Investment ceases to be an Authorised Investment, Kosmos will, as soon as reasonably practicable upon becoming aware of this, procure that the relevant investment is replaced by an Authorised Investment or cash, provided that if it does not propose liquidating the relevant investment earlier than its maturity, it shall notify the Facility Agent that such investment is no longer an Authorised Investment promptly upon becoming aware of this and, subject to it having provided such notice, it will not be obliged to liquidate such investment before its maturity date unless either of the Facility Agent, acting reasonably, requests it to do so.
 
99






 
23.3                       Realisations
 
(A)                               Upon the realisation (whether by way of disposal, maturity or otherwise) of any Authorised Investment, the net proceeds of realisation shall either immediately be credited directly to the Project Account from which the Authorised Investment or such investment was made, or (unless a Default has occurred and is continuing) immediately be invested in another Authorised Investment, whichever Kosmos directs.
 
(B)                               Upon the receipt of any interest, dividends or other income from or in respect of any Authorised Investment, such interest, dividends or other income shall be credited to the Project Account concerned with the Authorised Investment or such other investment from which such interest, dividend or other income derives, or (if such interest, dividend or other income is derived from an Authorised Investment and such Authorised Investment is to be retained after such interest, dividend or other income is received and Kosmos so requests) the relevant interest, dividend or other income shall be reinvested in that Authorised Investment.
 
23.4                       Project Accounts include Authorised Investments
 
(A)                               Any reference in this Agreement to the balance standing to the credit of one of the Project Accounts shall be deemed to include a reference to the Authorised Investments in which all or part of such balance is for the time being invested.  (other than for the purposes of determining the balance required to comply with clause 20.1 (Project Accounts)).  In the event of any dispute as to the value of any Authorised Investment for the purpose of determining the amount deemed to be standing to the credit of a Project Account, that value shall be determined by the Facility Agent acting reasonably and in good faith and following consultation with Kosmos and having given due consideration to any representations given by Kosmos within the period required by the Facility Agent (which period shall not, in any event, be of shorter duration than five Business Days).  If Kosmos so requests, the Facility Agent will give Kosmos details of the basis or method of its determination.
 
(B)                               Kosmos may, by notice in writing to the Facility Agent and the Account Bank, deem an Authorised Investment to be concerned with a different Project Account so as to transfer Authorised Investments between Project Accounts, if:
 
(i)                                      the aggregate amount standing to the credit of each Project Account remains the same; or
 
(ii)                                   the transfer of an equivalent amount between those Project Accounts would be permitted.
 
23.5                       Security over Authorised Investments
 
Prior to the Borrower making any Authorised Investment in England, the Borrower shall ensure that it has entered into the Offshore Security Assignment.  To the extent that any Authorised Investment is made in a jurisdiction other than England, the Borrower shall
 
100






 
execute and deliver, such other security as the Facility Agent may reasonably require from time to time in order to ensure that such Authorised Investment is secured to the Finance Parties by way of first priority security, in a form and substance satisfactory to the Facility Agent and the Security Agent, acting reasonably.
 
23.6                       Interest on balances in Project Accounts
 
Each sum credited to a Project Account from time to time shall, from the time it is so credited until the time it is withdrawn therefrom (whether for the purpose of making an Authorised Investment or otherwise for application in accordance with the terms of this Agreement), bear interest at such rate as Kosmos may from time to time agree with the relevant Account Bank.

28.28     Due execution of security assignments
 
(A)          The Security Agent shall have safe custody and control of the Assignments (which term shall, for the avoidance of doubt for the purposes of this clause 28.28 (Due execution of security assignments), be deemed not to include the Assignment of Reinsurance Rights until its execution by KEG and the relevant insurers, it being agreed that Kosmos shall take all such steps as may be reasonable (taking into account all of the circumstances at the time and the steps taken previously by Kosmos) to procure its execution by KEG and the relevant insurers).  The Security Agent shall execute and date such documents for and on behalf of the Finance Parties in any of the following circumstances:
 
(i)            if a Default has occurred and is continuing and the Majority Senior Lenders have instructed the Security Agent to execute and date the Assignments for and on behalf of the Finance Parties; or
 
(ii)           if instructed to do so at any time by the Borrower.
 
(B)          Each party to this Agreement irrevocably authorises the Security Agent to execute the Assignments for and on behalf of the Finance Parties and to date the Assignments when it is required to do so under paragraph (A) above.  The

Assignments shall be of no force or effect until they are duly executed by the Security Agent and dated for and on behalf of the Finance Parties in accordance with this clause 28.28 (Due execution of security assignments).
 
(C)          In the event that the Security Agent signs and dates the Assignments in accordance with this clause 28.28 (Due execution of security assignments), then the Borrower shall (and the Facility Agent may) without the requirement for any further authorisation from any Obligor make a Utilisation under the Facility to meet the payment of any stamp duty which is payable as a consequence of the Assignments being signed and dated.  The Borrower shall (and the Facility Agent shall if it effects the Utilisation under the Facility) apply the relevant funds promptly in payment of the relevant stamp duty and shall ensure that the Assignments are stamped and registered as soon as practicable (and in any event within any time period required by law).  The Borrower (or the Facility Agent, as the case may be) shall in each case notify the Security Agent and each Finance Party upon making the payment of any stamp duty and the stamping and registration of the Assignments.
 
28.29     Stamp duty and other impost waiver
 
The Borrower shall use its reasonable endeavours to seek a waiver or exemption from any stamp duty, documentary taxes or any other similar tax, charge or impost which may be payable upon the execution of any of the Assignments, or to obtain confirmation that no such duty, taxes, charges or impost would be payable upon execution.  In the event that such waiver, exemption or confirmation is successfully obtained in relation to any Assignment, the Borrower shall promptly instruct the Security Trustee to execute and date such Assignment(s) for and on behalf of the Finance Parties in accordance with clause 28.28(A)(ii) above.
 
28.30     Lenders custody of documents

(B)          Paragraph (A) above shall not apply to a Lender at any time at which such Lender (i) has a right to take Enforcement Action; (ii) has the written consent of the Borrower; or (iii) is required to deliver such Finance Document or other document or agreement by any order or a court or regulatory authority or other legal or regulatory requirement.
 
28.31     Security Documents: consents, ranking and perfection
 
(A)          No Obligor shall be required to grant any assignment of rights under any contract, or Security Interest over any asset (including contracts and rights), where the consent of any Government or any governmental body, regulatory
 
127






 
body or state-owned or controlled company or enterprise is required for the granting of such assignment or Security Interest.
 
(B)          With the exception of those consents referred to in paragraph (A) above, Kosmos shall use reasonable endeavours to seek any other required third party consents required in relation to any Security Document, provided that the obtaining of such consent shall not be a condition precedent to any Utilisation of the Facility and provided that there shall be no fixed date by which such consent must be obtained.
 
(C)          Kosmos shall use reasonable endeavours to obtain acknowledgments to any notices of assignment served in relation to any Security Document, provided that receipt of such acknowledgments shall not be a condition precedent to any Utilisation of the Facility.
 
(D)          Where required by the terms of any agreement which is binding upon any Obligor, any Security Interest granted in favour of the Lenders shall be subordinated to the interests of the parties under such agreement.
 
(E)           With the exception of the Charges over Shares, perfection of any Security Interest shall not be a condition precedent to first Utilisation.
 
28.32     IPO Reorganisation
 
The Finance Parties agree that, notwithstanding the terms of any Finance Document which, but for this clause, may have prevented an Obligor from participating in and/or implementing an IPO Reorganisation, each Obligor may participate in and implement such an IPO Reorganisation and no term or condition of any Finance Document which would, but for this Clause, prevent an IPO Reorganisation, shall prevent such an IPO Reorganisation or require KEH, or any Obligor or any of their respective Subsidiaries to act, or omit to act, in a manner which would or might reasonably be expected to prevent, impede, restrict or result in the obstruction of, or delay to, an IPO Reorganisation, provided that: (i) such IPO Reorganisation is for the purposes of an IPO substantially as described in the Form S-1 filed by Kosmos Energy Ltd. with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on 14 January 2011 (including any updated filing in relation to such Form S-1); and (ii) the interests of the Finance Parties are not materially prejudiced.  Without limitation (and without prejudice to clause 28.8(C), the foregoing shall require the Finance Parties to release and discharge the Security Interests created pursuant to any Security Document, provided that immediately upon such release substantially equivalent security is granted in favour of the Finance Parties on substantially similar terms and such that the position of the Finance Parties is not materially prejudiced.  Nothing in this clause 28.32 shall prevent any Obligor from acting or omitting to act in any way (including implementing an IPO Reorganisation) which would otherwise be permitted by the terms of the Finance Documents.
 
28.33     Ghanaian security
 
(A)          The Borrower shall use reasonable endeavours to obtain a legal opinion from Ghanaian counsel confirming that the consent obtained on 18 December 2010
 
128






 
from the Ghana National Petroleum Corporation and the Ministry of Energy of Ghana, which was required in relation to the grant of certain Security Interests (the Ghana Security Interests) contemplated by the Security Documents (as defined in the Existing Finance Documents), would extend to the grant of such Security Interests in favour of the Finance Parties in the context of the Finance Documents.
 
(B)          If such a legal opinion is obtained, the Borrower shall then promptly enter into security documents in the required form in order to grant to the Finance Parties equivalent Security Interests to the Ghana Security Interests in the context of the Finance Documents.  Such security documents will be held by the Security Agent in accordance with clause 28.28 (Due execution of security assignments) above.
 
28.34     IFC access
 
(A)          The Borrower and each Guarantor shall (and shall procure that each contractor acting on their behalf shall), upon IFCs request (acting reasonably), such request to be made with reasonable prior notice to the relevant Borrower and Guarantor (except if a Default is continuing):

(B)          The exercise by an IFC representative and/or the CAO, and in respect of the CAO at its own expense, under paragraph (A) above of any right to conduct site visits and/or of any access right shall be at the sole risk and expense of such IFC representative (to the extent that such expense exceeds USD 30,000 per annum) and/or CAO.
 
(C)          When conducting site visits or utilising access rights pursuant to paragraph (A) above, any IFC representative and/or the CAO shall follow all reasonable instructions of Kosmos and/or its contractors (as applicable) and shall comply with procedures for the maintenance and security of the relevant assets or

30.                              Changes to the Lenders
 
30.1                       Assignments and transfers and changes in Facility Office by the Lenders
 
Subject to this clause, a Lender (the Existing Lender) may:
 
(A)          (i)            assign any of its rights; or
 
(ii)           transfer by novation any of its rights and obligations,
 
to an Affiliate, another Lender, an Affiliate of another Lender or a Qualifying Bank, another bank or financial institution or to a trust or other entity which is regularly engaged in or established for the purpose of making, purchasing or investing in loans, securities or other financial assets or such other institution as the Borrower may agree in writing (the New Lender), or
 
(B)          change its Facility Office.
 
30.2                       Conditions of assignment and transfer or change in Facility Office
 
(A)          The consent of Kosmos is required for an assignment or transfer by an Existing Lender, unless the assignment or transfer is (i) to, or in favour of, another Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or a Qualifying Bank; or (ii) made at a time when an Event of Default is continuing.
 
(B)          The consent of Kosmos is required for a change in Facility Office to a different jurisdiction.  In the case of a change of Facility Office for which Kosmoss consent is not required, the Lender must notify Kosmos of the new Facility Office promptly on the change taking effect.
 
(C)          The consent of Kosmos to an assignment or transfer or change in Facility Office must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (and will be deemed to have been given five Business Days after the relevant Lender has requested it unless consent is expressly refused by Kosmos within that time).
 
(D)          In the event a Letter of Credit is outstanding, transfer or assignment of a Commitment shall require the prior consent of each LC Issuing Bank.
 
(E)           An assignment will only be effective on:
 
(i)            receipt by the Facility Agent of written confirmation from the New Lender (in form and substance satisfactory to the Facility Agent) that the New Lender will assume the same obligations to the other Finance Parties as it would have been under if it was an Original Lender; and
 
137






 
(ii)           the New Lender entering into the documentation required for it to accede as a party to the relevant Finance Documents (including, but not limited to, the Intercreditor Agreement).
 
(F)           A transfer will only be effective if the procedure set out in clause 30.5 (Procedure for transfer) is complied with.
 
(G)          If:
 
(i)            a Lender assigns or transfers any of its rights or obligations under the Finance Documents or changes its Facility Office; and
 
(ii)           as a result of circumstances existing at the date the assignment, transfer or change occurs, an Obligor would be obliged to make a payment to the New Lender or Lender acting through its new Facility Office under clause 15 (Tax Gross Up and Indemnities) or clause 16 (Increased Costs),
 
then the New Lender or Lender acting through its new Facility Office is only entitled to receive payment under those clauses to the same extent as the Existing Lender or Lender acting through its previous Facility Office would have been if the assignment, transfer or change had not occurred.
 
(H)          Each New Lender, by executing the relevant Transfer Certificate confirms, for the avoidance of doubt, that the Facility Agent has authority to execute on its behalf any amendment or waiver that has been approved by or on behalf of the requisite Lender or Lenders in accordance with the Finance Documents on or prior to the date on which the transfer or assignment becomes effective in accordance with this Agreement.
 
(I)            Any assignment or transfer of part of the Existing Lenders rights and/or obligations must be a minimum of USD 5 million and must not result in the Existing Lender retaining less than USD 5 million.

The New Lender shall, on the date upon which an assignment or transfer takes effect, pay to the Facility Agent (for its own account) a fee of USD 2,500.
 
30.4                       Limitation of responsibility of Existing Lenders
 
(A)          Unless expressly agreed to the contrary, an Existing Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility to a New Lender for:
 
(i)            the legality, validity, effectiveness, adequacy or enforceability of the Finance Documents or any other documents;
 
(ii)           the financial condition of any Obligor;
 
138







 
(iii)          the performance and observance by any Obligor of its obligations under the Finance Documents or any other documents; or
 
(iv)          the accuracy of any statements (whether written or oral) made in or in connection with any Finance Document or any other document,
 
and any representations or warranties implied by law are excluded.
 
(B)          Each New Lender confirms to the Existing Lender and the other Finance Parties that it:
 
(i)            has made (and shall continue to make) its own independent investigation and assessment of the financial condition and affairs of each Obligor and its related entities in connection with its participation in the Facility and has not relied exclusively on any information provided to it by the Existing Lender in connection with any Finance Document; and
 
(ii)           will continue to make its own independent appraisal of the creditworthiness of each Obligor and its related entities whilst any amount is or may be outstanding under the Finance Documents or any Commitment is in force.
 
(C)          Nothing in any Finance Document obliges an Existing Lender to:
 
(i)            accept a re-transfer or re-assignment from a New Lender of any of the rights and obligations assigned or transferred under this clause; or
 
(ii)           support any losses directly or indirectly incurred by the New Lender by reason of the non-performance by any Obligor of its obligations under the Finance Documents or otherwise.
 
30.5        Procedure for transfer

(B)          On the Transfer Date:
 
(i)            to the extent that in the Transfer Certificate the Existing Lender seeks to transfer by novation its rights and obligations under the Finance
 
139






 
Documents, each of the Obligors and the Existing Lender shall be released from further obligations towards one another under the Finance Documents and their respective rights against one another under the Finance Documents shall be cancelled (being the Discharged Rights and Obligations);
 
(ii)           each of the Obligors and the New Lender shall assume obligations towards one another and/or acquire rights against one another which differ from the Discharged Rights and Obligations only insofar as that Obligor and the New Lender have assumed and/or acquired the same in place of that Obligor and the Existing Lender;
 
(iii)          the Facility Agent, each Mandated Lead Arranger, the New Lender and the other Finance Parties shall acquire the same rights and assume the same obligations between themselves as they would have acquired and assumed had the New Lender been an Original Lender with the rights and/or obligations acquired or assumed by it as a result of the transfer and to that extent such Finance Parties and the Existing Lender shall each be released from further obligations to each other under the Finance Documents; and
 
(iv)          the New Lender shall become a Party as a Lender.

Schedule 6 Mandatory Cost Formulae
 
1.                                     The Mandatory Cost is an addition to the interest rate to compensate Lenders for the cost of compliance with (a) the requirements of the Bank of England (and/or the Financial Services Authority (or, in either case, any other Authority which replaces all or any of its functions) or (b) the requirements of the European Central Bank.
 
2.                                     On the first day of each Interest Period (or as soon as possible thereafter) the Facility Agent shall calculate, as a percentage rate, a rate (the Additional Cost Rate) for each Lender, in accordance with the paragraphs set out below.  The Mandatory Cost will be calculated by the Facility Agent as a weighted average of the Lenders Additional Cost Rates (weighted in proportion to the percentage participation of each Lender in the relevant Loan) and will be expressed as a percentage rate per annum.
 
3.                                     The Additional Cost Rate for any Lender lending from a Facility Office in a Participating Member State will be the percentage notified by that Lender to the Facility Agent.  This percentage will be certified by that Lender in its notice to that Facility Agent to be its reasonable determination of the cost (expressed as a percentage of that Lenders participation in all Loans made from that Facility Office) of complying with the minimum reserve requirements of the European Central Bank in respect of loans made from that Facility Office.
 
4.                                     The Additional Cost Rate for any Lender lending from a Facility Office in the United Kingdom will be calculated by the Facility Agent as follows:
 
(a)           in relation to a sterling Loan:
 



    

  per cent. per annum         
 
(b)                                in relation to a Loan in any currency other than sterling:
 



    

  per cent. per annum         
 
Where:
 
A                                       is the percentage of Eligible Liabilities (assuming these to be in excess of any stated minimum) which that Lender is from time to time required to maintain as an interest-free cash ratio deposit with the Bank of England to comply with cash ratio requirements.
 
B                                       is the percentage rate of interest (excluding the Margin and the Mandatory Cost and, if the Loan is an Unpaid Sum, the additional rate of interest specified in paragraph (A) of clause 11.4 (Default interest)) payable for the relevant Interest Period on the Loan.
 
178






 
C                                       is the percentage (if any) of Eligible Liabilities which that Lender is required from time to time to maintain as interest-bearing Special Deposits with the Bank of England.
 
D                                       is the percentage rate per annum payable by the Bank of England to the Facility Agent on interest-bearing Special Deposits.
 
E                                        is designed to compensate Lenders for amounts payable under the Fees Rules and is calculated by the Facility Agent as being the average of the most recent rates of charge supplied by the Reference Banks to that Facility Agent pursuant to paragraph 7 below and expressed in pounds per £1,000,000.
 
5.            For the purposes of this Schedule:
 
(A)                              Eligible Liabilities and Special Deposits have the meanings given to them from time to time under or pursuant to the Bank of England Act 1998 or (as may be appropriate) by the Bank of England.
 
(B)                              Fees Rules means the rules on periodic fees contained in the FSA Supervision Manual or such other law or regulation as may be in force from time to time in respect of the payment of fees for the acceptance of deposits.
 
(C)                               Fee Tariffs means the fee tariffs specified in the Fees Rules under activity group A.1 Deposit acceptors (ignoring any minimum fee or zero-rated fee required pursuant to the Fees Rules but taking into account any applicable discount rate); and
 
(D)                               Tariff Base has the meaning given to it in, and will be calculated in accordance with, the Fees Rules.
 
6.                                     In application of the above formulae, A, B, C and D will be included in the formulae as percentages (i.e. 5 per cent. will be included in the formula as 5 and not as 0.05).  A negative result obtained by subtracting D from B shall be taken as zero.  The resulting figures shall be rounded to four decimal places.
 
7.                                     If requested by the Facility Agent, each Reference Bank shall, as soon as practicable after publication by the Financial Services Authority, supply to that Facility Agent, the rate of charge payable by that Reference Bank to the Financial Services Authority pursuant to the Fees Rules in respect of the relevant financial year of the Financial Services Authority (calculated for this purpose by that Reference Bank as being the average of the Fee Tariffs applicable to that Reference Bank for that financial year) and expressed in pounds per £1,000,000 of the Tariff Base of that Reference Bank.
 
8.                                     Each Lender shall supply any information required by the Facility Agent for the purpose of calculating its Additional Cost Rate.  In particular, but without limitation, each Lender shall supply the following information on or prior to the date on which it becomes a Lender:
 
(A)                               the jurisdiction of its Facility Office; and
 
179






 
(B)                               any other information that the Facility Agent may reasonably require for such purpose.
 
Each Lender shall promptly notify the Facility Agent of any change to the information provided by it pursuant to this paragraph.
 
9.                                     The percentages of each Lender for the purpose of A and C above and the rates of charge of each Reference Bank for the purpose of E above shall be determined by the Facility Agent based upon the information supplied to it pursuant to paragraphs 7 and 8 above and on the assumption that, unless a Lender notifies the Facility Agent to the contrary, each Lenders obligations in relation to cash ratio deposits and Special Deposits are the same as those of a typical bank from its jurisdiction of incorporation with a Facility Office in the same jurisdiction as its Facility Office.
 
10.                              The Facility Agent shall have no liability to any person if such determination results in an Additional Cost Rate which over or under compensates any Lender and shall be entitled to assume that the information provided by any Lender or Reference Bank pursuant to paragraphs 3, 7 and 8 above is true and correct in all respects.
 
11.                              The Facility Agent shall distribute the additional amounts received as a result of the Mandatory Cost to the Lenders on the basis of the Additional Cost Rate for each Lender based on the information provided by each Lender and each Reference Bank pursuant to paragraphs 3, 7 and 8 above.
 
12.                              Any determination by the Facility Agent pursuant to this Schedule in relation to a formula, the Mandatory Cost, an Additional Cost Rate or any amount payable to a Lender shall, in the absence of manifest or proven error, be conclusive and binding on all Parties.
 
13.                              The Facility Agent may from time to time, after consultation with Kosmos and the Lenders, determine and notify to all Parties any amendments which are required to be made to this Schedule in order to comply with any change in law, regulation or any requirements from time to time imposed by the Bank of England or the Financial Services Authority or the European Central Bank (or, in any case, any other Authority which replaces all or any of its functions) and any such determination shall, in the absence of manifest or proven error, be conclusive and binding on all Parties.

1.                                     Confidentiality Undertaking: You undertake:
 
(A)                              to keep the Confidential Information confidential and not to disclose it to anyone except as provided for by paragraph 2 below and to ensure that the Confidential Information is protected with security measures with a degree of care not less than that which you would apply to your own confidential information;

22






 
obliged to release the Charged Property from the Charge for such further period as the Security Agent may reasonably determine.

18.1                       Appointment
 
The Chargor hereby appoints, irrevocably and by way of security, the Security Agent and any person nominated in writing by the Security Agent as attorney of the Chargor severally to be the attorney of the Chargor (with full powers of substitution and delegation), on its behalf and in its name or otherwise, at such time and in such manner as the attorney may think fit:
 
(A)          to do anything which the Chargor is or may be obliged to do (but has not done) under this Deed including, but without limitation, following an Event of Default that is continuing, to complete and execute under hand or as a deed any transfer of Shares and the execution and delivery of any deeds, charges, assignments or other Security; and
 
(B)          generally to enable the exercise of all or any of the Rights conferred on the Security Agent in relation to the Charged Property or under or in connection with this Deed.
 
18.2                       Ratification
 
The Chargor covenants to ratify and confirm whatever any attorney shall do or purport to do in the exercise or purported exercise of the power of attorney in Clause 18.1 (Appointment).
 
19.                              CURRENCY INDEMNITY
 
(A)          If any sum due from the Chargor under this Deed (a Sum), or any order, judgment or award given or made in relation to a Sum, has to be converted from the currency (the First Currency) in which that Sum is payable into another currency (the Second Currency) for the purpose of:
 
(i)            making or filing a claim or proof against the Chargor; or
 
(ii)           obtaining or enforcing an order, judgment or award in relation to any litigation or arbitration proceedings,
 
23






 
the Chargor shall as an independent obligation, within five Business Days of demand, indemnify the Security Agent against any cost, loss or liability arising out of or as a result of the conversion including any discrepancy between (A) the rate of exchange used to convert that Sum from the First Currency into the Second Currency and (B) the rate or rates of exchange available to that person at the time of its receipt of that Sum.
 
(B)          The Chargor waives any right it may have in any jurisdiction to pay any amount due under this Deed in a currency or currency unit other than that in which it is expressed to be payable.
 
20.                              CERTIFICATE TO BE CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE
 
For all purposes, including any Proceedings, a copy of a certificate signed by an officer of the Security Agent as to the amount of any indebtedness comprised in the Secured Liabilities for the time being shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive evidence against the Chargor as to the amount thereof.
 
21.                              COSTS AND EXPENSES

1.1                              Scope and Duration of Insurances
 
Kosmos shall maintain, as a Named Insured, those insurances set out in Part 2 of the Appendix to this Schedule (the Kosmos Insurance), and shall as far as it is able by exercising its rights under the Project Agreements use its reasonable endeavours to procure that the Operator maintains the insurance set out in Part 1 of the Appendix (the Project Insurance) in relation to the Borrowing Base Assets, in each case in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule (together the Insurances).  The obligation to maintain and procure insurance shall exclude any insurance to the extent that the cover to be maintained is not available on reasonable commercial terms or no longer reflects insurance which would be implemented and maintained in accordance with good international offshore oil industry practice or ceases to be generally available in the market.
 
(A)                               Legal or Contractual Requirements
 
Without prejudice to the other provisions of this Schedule and any other provisions of this Agreement, Kosmos shall effect and maintain in full force and effect those Insurances which it is required to effect from time to time by any applicable law or by the terms of any Project Agreement to which it is, at any time, a party.
 
(B)                               Kosmos Supplementary Insurances
 
Kosmos may, at any time, effect such other insurances (Supplementary Insurances) in addition to or supplementing those referred to elsewhere in this Schedule in accordance with prudent industry practice provided that such Supplementary Insurances shall not adversely affect any insured partys rights or ability to recover under the Insurances and Project Reinsurances (as defined below).
 
1.2                              Actions of the Finance Parties
 
For the purpose of this Schedule, any Finance Party who is required to take any action or exercise any discretion under this Schedule shall act reasonably and in good faith and in consultation with the Borrower, the Insurance Consultant, the Technical Consultant or other consultants.
 
1.3                              Finance Party Beneficiary as Additional Assureds
 
The Security Agent (and in respect of third party liability risks the Security Agents and the Finance Parties officers, directors, shareholders, agents, employees and servants) shall be named as an additional assured (each a Finance Party Beneficiary and together the Finance Party Beneficiaries) under the Insurance and Project
 






 
Reinsurance, in each case, for its rights and interests (other than insurances for risks associated with motor vehicle insurances or workers compensation insurances).
 
1.4                              Loss Payable Arrangements
 
Each First Party Insurance policy shall contain a loss payable clause (and, with respect to Project Reinsurances (as defined below) a loss payable/cut-through) in customary form generally available in the relevant insurance market for similar policies (and as approved by the Security Agent in consultation with the Insurance Consultant, each acting reasonably), provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, no change shall be made to any such loss payable clause which shall prevent Insurance Proceeds which arise under third party liability insurances and are payable for the benefit of third parties from being paid directly to such third parties or to reimburse any person who has already paid the third party.
 
1.5                              Application of Loss Proceeds
 
All loss proceeds received by the Borrower are to be dealt with in accordance with Clause 10.5 of this Agreement (Insurance Receipts).

1.7                              The Lenders Clauses
 
Kosmos shall use reasonable endeavours to obtain provisions or other acceptable provisions in the policy wording of the Kosmos Insurance and shall as far as it is able by exercising its rights under the Project Agreements use its reasonable endeavours to procure that the Project Insurance procured by the Operator has in it provisions or other acceptable provisions dealing with each of the following matters:
 
(A)                               A waiver of all rights of subrogation which the insurers may have or acquire against any Finance Party Beneficiary (in its capacity as such) arising out of any occurrence in respect of which any claim is admitted against Kosmos, except in respect of a Vitiating Act (defined below) that any of the Finance Party Beneficiaries has committed.
 
(B)                               All provisions of the policy (except those relating to limits of liability and deductibles) to operate as if they were a separate policy covering each insured party.
 
(C)                               The insurers waive all rights of contribution against any other insurance effected by any Finance Party Beneficiary.
 
(D)                               Any circumstances of fraud, misrepresentation, non-disclosure or breach of any warranty or condition committed by one insured party or any act, negligence, error or omission on the part of any insured party (a Vitiating Act), shall not
 
2






 
prejudice the right to indemnity of any other insured party who has an insurable interest and who has not committed a Vitiating Act and an undertaking by the insurers to each Finance Party Beneficiary that they will not seek to avoid any liability as a consequence of any Vitiating Act or other such similar language as may be contained in a standard Multiple Insured clause.
 
(E)                                Other than at renewal where notice has been given in accordance with the relevant policy conditions or where specific contrary provision is made for within the relevant policy, no material reduction in limits or the extent of insurance coverage or the interests of any insured party or material increases in exclusions, deductions or exceptions without the written consent of the Security Agent (after consultation with the Insurance Consultant and Kosmos (and such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed)).

(I)                                   A cut-through clause for all first party reinsurance coverages including the CAR and Energy Package in a form reasonably acceptable to the Security Agent in consultation with the Insurance Consultant.
 
For the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting the general application of paragraph 1.1 above, it is expressly acknowledged that any obligation to obtain the Lenders clauses set out above (including any acknowledgement in any policy) is subject to paragraph 1.1 and Underwriters agreement.
