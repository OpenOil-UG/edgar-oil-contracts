ACNCF (Current Quarter) =
 
(100% + DQ)
 
--------------- x ACNCF (Previous Quarter) + NCF (Current Quarter)
 
100%
 
where:
 
ACNCF
= accumulated compounded net cash flow
NCF
= net cash flow
DC
= quarterly compound rate (in percent).
 
The formula will be calculated using quarterly compound rates (in percent) of 2,41%, 3,56%, 4,66%, 6,78% and 8,78% which correspond to annual compound rates (“DA”) of 10%, 15%, 20%, 30% and 40%, respectively, as referred to in previous paragraph.
 
5.             The Contractor rate of return in any given Quarter shall be deemed to be between the largest DA which yields a positive or zero ACNCF and the smallest DA which causes the ACNCF to be negative.
 
6.             The payment to Contractor and the calculation of the production allowance in a given Quarter shall be in accordance with the table in paragraph 3 above using the Contractor Group’s rate of return as per this article in the preceding Quarter.
 
7.             It is possible for the Contractor rate of return to decline as a result of negative cash flow in a Quarter with the consequence that the payment to Contractor and the calculation of the production allowance would increase in the subsequent Quarter.
 
8.             Pending finalization of accounts, the payment to Contractor and the calculation of the production allowance shall be calculated on the basis of provisional estimates, if necessary, of deemed rate of return as approved by Sonangol. Adjustments shall be subsequently effected in accordance with the procedure to be established by agreement between Sonangol and the Contractor.
