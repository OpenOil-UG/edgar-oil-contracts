ARTICLE 19
VALUATION OF PETROLEUM
19.1        For the purpose of this Contract, the value of Crude Oil, Condensate and Natural Gas (refer Article 21) shall be based on the price determined as provided herein.
 
19.2        A price for Crude Oil shall be determined for each Month or such other period as the Parties may agree (hereinafter referred to as “the Delivery Period”) in terms of United States Dollars per Barrel, on import parity basis (with marine freight being determined on the basis of nearest port to the Contract Area) for Crude Oil produced and sold or otherwise disposed of from Contract Area, for each Delivery Period, in accordance with the appropriate basis for that type of sale or disposal specified below. Subject to the provisions of this Article 19, it is clearly understood that the actual prices received by the Company(ies) from the sales will form the basis for the purposes of cost recovery, Profit Petroleum sharing and payment of royalty as provided in the Articles 15, 16 and 17 respectively. The basis of valuation given in this Article for the purpose of Article 15,16 and 17 shall apply only where Government is of the view that sale prices realised by the Company(ies) are not consistent with the price realisable at Arms Length Sales.
 
19.3        In the event that some or all of a Company’s or Contractor’s total sales of Crude Oil during a Delivery Period are made to third parties at Arms Length Sales, all sales so made shall be valued at the weighted average of the prices actually received by a Company, calculated by dividing the total receipts from all such sales at the Delivery Point by the total number of Barrels of the Crude Oil sold in such sales.
 
19.3.1      Each Company constituting the Contractor shall separately submit to the designated nominee of the Government, within fifteen (15) days of the end of each Delivery Period, a report containing the actual prices obtained in their respective Arms Length Sales for any Crude Oil. Such reports shall distinguish between term sales and spot sales and itemize volumes, customers, prices received and credit terms, and a Company shall allow the designated nominee(s) of the Government to examine the relevant sales contracts.
 
19.4        For the purpose of determining price at Arms Length Sales, the price of the Crude Oil at which sale takes place will generally be based on per Barrel of one or more crude oils which, at the time of calculation, are being freely and actively traded in the international market and are similar in characteristics and quality to the Crude Oil in respect of which the price is being determined, selling price to be ascertained from Platt’s Crude Oil Market Wire daily publication (“Platt’s”), or the spot market for the same crude oils ascertained in the same manner, whichever price more truly reflects the current value of such crude oils. For any Delivery
59

 

        Period in which sales take place, the price shall be the arithmetic average price per Barrel determined by calculating the average for such Delivery Period of the mean of the high and low FOB prices for each day of the crude oils selected for comparison adjusted for differences in the Crude Oil and the crude oils being compared for quality, transportation costs, delivery time, quantity, payment terms and other contract terms to the extent known and other relevant factors. In the event that Platt’s ceases to be published or is not published for a period of thirty (30) consecutive days, the Parties shall agree on an alternative daily publication. The Contractor shall make available all the data pertaining to pricing of Crude to enable Government to decide that the proposed sale price by the Contractor/each constituents of the Contractor reflects a fair market price for the Crude.
 
19.4.1      In the event that, at the relevant time, no crude oils of similar quality to the Crude Oil to be sold are being actively traded in the international markets where prices can be ascertained by international publication, or the official FOB selling prices and the international spot market price vary widely between producers, the Parties shall meet in good faith to determine an appropriate pricing basis.
 
19.5        The Contractor shall determine the relevant prices in accordance with this Article and the calculation, basis of calculation and the price determined shall be supplied to the Government and shall be subject to agreement by the Government.
 
19.6        In the event that the Parties fail to reach agreement on any matter concerning selection of the crude oils for comparison, the calculation, the basis of, or mechanism for the calculation of the prices, the prices arrived at, the adjustment of any price or generally about the manner in which the prices are determined according to the provisions of this Article within thirty (30) days, or such longer period as may be mutually agreed between the Parties, from the date of commencement of Commercial Production or the end of each Delivery Period thereafter, any Party may refer the matter or matters in issue for final determination by a sole expert or arbitrator appointed as provided in Article 33.
 
19.6.1      If the matter is referred to the sole expert, within ten (10) days of the said appointment, the Parties shall provide the expert with all information they deem necessary or as the expert may reasonably require.
 
19.6.2      Within fifteen (15) days from the date of his appointment, the expert shall report to the Parties on the issue(s) referred to him for determination, applying the criteria or mechanism set forth herein and indicate his decision thereon to be applicable for the relevant Delivery Period for Crude Oil and such decision shall be accepted as final and binding by the Parties.
 
19.6.3      Any price or pricing mechanism agreed by the Parties pursuant to the provisions of this Article shall not be changed retroactively.
 
19.7        In the event that all sales of Crude Oil in a Delivery Period by a Company constituting the Contractor are to be made to an Affiliate, the Parties may agree
60

 

        on an alternative method of valuing the Crude Oil for the purposes of this Contract, provided that such alternative method results in an internationally competitive fair market valuation for that Delivery Period. In case of disagreement, the decision of the Government on determining a Crude price in case of sales to an Affiliate shall be final and binding.
 
19.8        In the event that in any Delivery Period there is more than one type of sales referred to in Articles 19.3 and 19.7, then, for the purpose of calculating Cost Petroleum and Profit Petroleum entitlement and royalty payments pursuant to Articles 15, 16 and 17 respectively, a single price per Barrel of Crude Oil for all the sales for the relevant Delivery Period shall be used. Such single price shall be the weighted average of the prices determined for each type of sale, weighted by the respective volumes of Crude Oil sold in each type of sale in the relevant Delivery Period.
 
19.9        The provisions specified above for the determination of the price of sales of Crude Oil shall apply mutatis mutandis to Condensates.
 
19.10       The price of Natural Gas shall be determined as provided in Article 21.
61

GENERAL PROVISIONS
1.1     Purpose
 
        Generally, the purpose of this Accounting Procedure is to set out principles and procedures of accounting which will enable the Government of India to monitor effectively the Contractor’s costs, expenditures, production and income so that the Government’s entitlement to Profit Petroleum can be accurately determined pursuant to the terms of the Contract.

        For purposes of this Accounting Procedure, the terms used herein which are defined in the Contract shall have the same meaning when used in this Accounting Procedure.
 
1.3     Inconsistency
 
        In the event of any inconsistency or conflict between the provisions of this Accounting Procedure and the other provisions of the Contract, the other provisions of the Contract shall prevail.

102

 

        and shall be in accordance with generally accepted standards and recognized accounting systems and consistent with normal petroleum industry practice and procedures for joint venture operations.
 
        Within ninety (90) days of receiving the above submission, the Government shall either provide written notification of its approval of the proposal or request, in writing, revisions to the proposal.
 
        Within one hundred and eighty (180) days from the Effective Date of the Contract, the Contractor and the Government shall agree on the outline of charts of accounts, records and reports which shall also describe the basis of the accounting system and procedures to be developed and used under this Contract. Following such agreement, the Contractor shall expeditiously prepare and provide the Government with formal copies of the comprehensive charts of accounts, records and reports and allow the Government to examine the manuals and to review procedures which are, and shall be, observed under the Contract.

1.9.1       Without prejudice to statutory rights, the Government, upon at least twenty (20) Business Days advance written notice to the Contractor, shall have the right to inspect and audit, during normal business hours, all records and documents supporting costs, expenditures, expenses, receipts and income, such as the Contractor’s accounts, books, records, invoices, cash vouchers, debit notes, price lists or similar documentation with respect to the Petroleum Operations conducted hereunder in each Year, within two (2) years (or such longer period as may be required in exceptional circumstances) from the end of such Year.

Where the Government requires verification of charges made by an Affiliate, the Government shall have the right to obtain an audit certificate from an internationally recognized firm of public accountants acceptable to both the Government and the Contractor, which may be the Contractor’s statutory auditor. Submission of the audit certificate, shall in no way relieve or diminish the
105

 

        responsibility of the Contractor for the compliance with the obligations under the Contract.
 
1.9.4       Any audit exceptions shall be made by the Government in writing and notified to the Contractor within one hundred and twenty (120) days following completion of the audit in question.

1.9.6       All agreed adjustments resulting from an audit and all adjustments required by prevailing exceptions under Section 1.9.5 shall be promptly made in the Contractor’s accounts and any consequential adjustments to the Government’s entitlement to Petroleum shall be made within thirty (30) days therefrom.
 
1.9.7       Notwithstanding any reference to a Sole Expert or Arbitration in accordance with the provisions of the Contract, in case any amount is claimed as due to the Government resulting from the audit exception but not accepted or settled by the Contractor, then the Contractor shall deposit such claimed amount in a escrow account to be opened with a financial institution, failing mutually agreed agreement with State Bank of India within thirty (30) days from the date when the amount is disputed by the Contractor. The amount in escrow account shall be appropriated or adjusted in accordance with the decision or award of the Sole Expert or Arbitral Tribunal as may be or otherwise as mutually agreed to between the Parties.
 
1.9.8       If the Contractor and the Government are unable to reach final agreement on proposed audit adjustments, either Party may refer any dispute thereon to a sole expert as provided for in the Contract. So long as any issues are outstanding with respect to an audit, the Contractor shall maintain the relevant documents and permit inspection thereof until the issue is resolved.
 
1.10        Revision of the Accounting Procedure
 
        By mutual agreement between the Government and the Contractor, this Accounting Procedure may be revised from time to time, in writing, signed by the Parties, stating the date upon which the amendments shall become effective.
