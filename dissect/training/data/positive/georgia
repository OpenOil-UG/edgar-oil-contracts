      Agreement.

7.2   If as a result of Force Majeure, either Party is rendered unable, wholly
      or in part, to carry out its obligations under this Agreement, other than

            and to pay the Cash Premium as set out in Article 1.11(b) of this
            Appendix 4.

1.10  (a)   If a non consenting party does not properly and in a timely manner
            exercise such option, including paying in a timely manner in
            accordance with Article 1.11 of this Appendix 4 all lump sum amounts
            and Cash Premiums, if any, due to the Consenting Party, such non
            consenting party shall have forfeited the options as set out in
            Article 1.9 of this Appendix 4 and the right to participate in the
            proposed programme, unless such programme, plan or operation is
            materially modified or expanded (in which case a new notice and
            option shall be given to such non consenting party under Article 1.9
            of this Appendix 4).

      (b)   A non consenting party shall become a Consenting Party with regard

            that such non consenting party shall in no way be deemed to be
            entitled to any lump sum amount or Cash Premium paid incident to
            such Exclusive Operation. Such non consenting party shall be
            entitled to cost recover its fifty (50) percent of expenses paid
            pursuant to Article 1.9 of this Appendix 4. If all Parties
            participate in the proposed operation, then such operation shall be
            conducted as a Joint Operation pursuant to the Agreement.

      (c)   If after the expiry of the period in which a non consenting party
            may exercise its option to participate in a work programme, the
            Consenting Party desires to proceed, notice shall be given to the
            State under the appropriate provision of the PSC requesting a
            meeting to advise the State that the discovery is considered to be a
            Commercial Discovery. Following such meeting, the Contractor shall
            (at the Consenting Party's sole cost) apply for an Exploitation Area
            (if applicable in the PSC). The non consenting party to such
            development plan shall be deemed to have:

            (i)   Forfeited all economic interest in such Exploitation Area;

            (ii)  Assumed a fiduciary duty to exercise its legal interest in
                  such Exploitation Area for the benefit of the Consenting

            Area, even if the development plan is modified or expanded
            subsequent to the commencement of

            to have forfeited any right to participate in the construction and
            ownership of facilities outside such Exploitation Area designed
            solely for the use of such Exploitation Area.

1.11  (a)   Within thirty (30) Days of the exercise of its option under Article
            1.9 of this Appendix 4, the non consenting party shall pay in
            immediately available funds to the Consenting Party a lump sum
            amount, in the currency designated by such Consenting Party, equal
            to such non consenting party's Contractor's Percentage Interest of

            in every Exclusive Operations relating to the Discovery, or well, as
            the case may be, in which the non consenting party desires to
            reinstate the rights it relinquished pursuant to Article 1.8 of this
            Appendix 4, and that were not previously paid by such non consenting
            party.

      (b)   In addition to amounts payable under Article 1.11(a) of this
            Appendix 4, within thirty (30) Days of the exercise of its option

            pay in immediately available funds, in the currency designated by
            the Consenting Party who took the risk of such Exclusive Operations,
            to such Consenting Party a Cash Premium equal to the total of five
            hundred percent (500%) of all liabilities and expenses, including
            overhead, that were incurred in the Exclusive Operations and any
            other Costs and Expenses whatsoever properly incurred in the

ANNEX 1: AGREED WORK PROGRAMME

The objective of the work programme will be to increase production and revenue
in the Samgori-Patardzeuli oil field through the implementation of a horizontal
well drilling programme and rehabilitation of existing wells. Additional
production and revenue may be obtained through exploration activity in the
adjacent areas of Licence block XIb.

The programme shall consist of three phases:

PHASE 1 will determine the feasibility of the proposed programme. It will
include a geological study of the existing oil-water contact, the drilling of
two horizontal well sections which may be from a new well or as a horizontal
section from an existing well, whichever will be more reasonable to drill on the
basis of hydro-geological studies. Both wells will be tested in the oil-bearing
Middle Eocene volcaniclastic reservoir with horizontal sections of 500 metres
long, The section length will be justified on geological and technical
feasibility. The expected cost of the geological study is $200,000, the
sidetrack well $1.5 million and the new well $3.0 million.

At the same time a continuous programme of workover and rehabilitation will
continue on the existing Samgori-Patardzeuli-South Dome-Krtsanisi fields with
the objective of increasing production to over 100 tons per day. Phase 1 of this
programme is expected to cost up to $1 million.
Phase 1 should be completed within 18 months of the Work Commencement Date
determined by Article 5.3 of the Agreement.

PHASE 2 In the event of successful results of Phase 1, Phase 2 will continue the
implementation of horizontal drilling from the old wells and the new horizontal
well drilling programme. Its conclusion would be defined as the point at which
revenue obtained from the Assignment Date exceeds the expenditure from the
Assignment Date.

The programme of workover and rehabilitation will continue on the existing
Samgori-Patardzeuli-South Dome-Krtsanisi fields with the objective of increasing
production to over 120 tons per day. The expected cost of this programme is
$600,000 per year.

PHASE 3 In the event of positive results from Phase 2, Phase 3 will conclude the
horizontal drilling from the old wells and the new horizontal well drilling
programme when at least 10 horizontal wells with horizontal sections of 500
metres long have been completed. The section length will be justified on
geological and technical feasibility.

                                       13
<PAGE>

The programme of workover and rehabilitation will continue on the existing
Samgori-Patardzeuli-South Dome-Krtsanisi fields with the objective of containing
the decline in production to less than 15% per year. The expected cost of this
programme is $600,000 per year.

The minimum capital expenditure in Phases 1 to 3 is expected to be: drilling
$22.5 million, workovers and facilities $2.2 million, geological studies
$200,000.

Phases 1 to 3 should be completed within thirty six (36) months of the Work
Commencement Date described in Article 5.3. This may be extended to a maximum of
60 months if required for successful implementation of Phase 2.

Drilling of only 10 (ten) horizontal sections is required within all three
Phases.

EXPLORATION DRILLING on the adjacent structures will be dependant on both the
technical and the commercial success of the above programme

         The Contractor may borrow funds from Third Parties and/or Affiliated
         Companies for the financing required for the investments necessary for
         Petroleum Operations. Finance Costs charged for such loans shall be
         recoupable as Costs and Expenses as provided in Article 11 and the
         Accounting Procedure.

2.5      Except as provided in Article 9.8.4, the Contractor shall be reimbursed
         for its investment and expenditures in connection with the conduct of

         Operations not by way of reimbursement in cash, but only by receipt of
         its share of Petroleum from the Contract Area to which it may become
         entitled by way of Costs and Expenses from Cost Recovery Petroleum
         under Article 11 and other provisions of this Contract. If Cost
         Recovery Petroleum produced from Development Areas within the Contract
         Area is insufficient to reimburse the Contractor for Costs and Expenses
         incurred by the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear its own losses in
         respect of any shortfall.

2.6      Where the Contractor is more than one person or entity, any obligation
         of the Contractor hereunder shall be a joint and several obligation of
         all of the persons and entities who constitute the Contractor, except
         for the following which shall be a several obligation of each of said
         persons and entities: i) the obligation to pay Profit Tax or any other
         tax assessed and levied on profit or net income in accordance with
         Article 17; ii) the obligation to observe stipulations relating to
         confidentiality set out in Article 28, except in respect of their
         application to anything done or to be done by the Contractor in his
         capacity as such; and iii) the obligation to observe stipulations
         relating to foreign exchange set forth in Article 19, except in respect
         of their application to anything done or to be done by the Contractor
         in his capacity as such.

2.7      The State has appointed the State Agency as its representative for the
         purposes set out in Article 8 of the Petroleum Law and Georgian Oil as
         its representative for the purposes set out in Article 9 of the
         Petroleum Law, with right of substitution and removal, each to exercise
         the State functions and to perform the State obligations under the
         Contract as prescribed by the Petroleum Law and to enjoy the benefit as
         herein provided. The State will give notice to the Contractor of the
         appointment and removal and substitution of its representatives. The
         Contractor will be entitled to assume that each State Representative
         has full authority to represent the State for those State purposes
         under the Contract assigned to it according to the Petroleum Law,
         including those where herein specific reference is made to the State

                                  CONTRACT AREA

3.1      The Contract Area is as set out by the geographic location and
         co-ordinates described in Annex "B" attached hereto and delineated on
         the map which forms part thereof. The total area of the Contract Area
         may hereafter be reduced only in accordance with the provisions of this
         Contract.

3.2      Except as for all rights and authorisations necessary for the
         implementation of the provisions of this Contract, no right is granted
         in favour of the Contractor to the use or disposal of any other natural
         or man-made resources or aquatic resources other than as provided in
         Article 3.2 and Article 13.5. For the sake of clarity, it is understood
         that produced hydrocarbons and associated substances may be injected
         into underground reservoirs provided the purpose of such activity is to
         avoid discharge of deleterious substances into the environment or to
         enhance hydrocarbon recovery or to conserve hydrocarbons for which
         there is no immediate commercial market. It is also understood that
         certain waters may be utilised in the Petroleum Operations envisioned
         herein to enhance hydrocarbon recovery or process the hydrocarbons for
         sale.

3.3      Contractor shall have the right of free ingress and egress to and over
         the Contract Area over State lands and waters on, over, and adjoining
         the Contract Area for the purpose of Petroleum exploration,
         development, production, and removal. The State Agency will assist
         Contractor to obtain other necessary easements and rights of way.

3.4      Contractor may, subject to approval and permitting required by the laws
         and regulations of Georgia and to any contractual arrangements with
         third parties as necessary or convenient, re-inject Petroleum extracted
         from the Contract Area for operational reasons, including drilling,
         testing, re-working, or other activities to enhance or maintain the
         recovery of Petroleum or for storage of Petroleum for which there is no
         immediate market, and re-inject produced water and associated
         substances into underground reservoirs capable of commercial Petroleum

                                       19
<PAGE>

         production or other strata if the purpose of such activity is to avoid
         discharge of deleterious substances into the environment. Petroleum
         re-injected for operational purposes is not to be deemed as "produced".
         Petroleum produced from the Contract Area for which there is no
         immediate commercial market may be also re-injected into appropriate
         reservoirs or other strata, either on or off the Contract Area, for
         storage. Title to such stored Petroleum shall pass to the Parties at
         the Measurement Point at the time the stored Petroleum is withdrawn
         from storage and sold or otherwise disposed of. All obligations of the
         Parties to account for and to pay taxes or other obligations on or with
         respect to such stored Petroleum shall accrue at the time title passes.

         year period specified in Article 4.1 the Contractor, after giving
         notice to Georgian Oil and the State Agency at least one (1) year prior

         Co-ordination Committee of such revised Development Plan shall be
         entitled to have an extension of the term of this Contract with respect
         to such Development Area for an additional term of fifteen (15) years,

                  of Article 4.2) not later than the thirty-fifth anniversary of
                  the Effective Date of this Contract or the producing life of
                  the Development Areas, whichever is the lesser.

5.2      Subject to the provisions of Article 5.1.6 and subject to the other
         provisions of this Article 5.2, the Contractor shall not be required
         pursuant to Article 5.1 to relinquish any portion of the Contract Area
         containing a Development Area.

         5.2.1    Following the expiration of five years from the declaration of
                  a Development Area, all depths deeper than the deeper of (a)
                  100 meters below the total depth of the deepest well drilled
                  within the Development Area, or (b) the base of the deepest
                  interval from which a well has produced, shall cease to be
                  included in the Development Area and shall be subject to
                  relinquishment under this Article 5.

         5.2.2    The Development Areas identified in Article 8.10 shall be
                  deemed to have been declared as Development Areas on the
                  Effective Date of this Contract.

5.3      The Contractor shall furnish the State Agency with a description of the
         boundaries of the part of the Contract Area to be relinquished not less
         than ninety (90) Days in advance of the deadline for the relinquishment
         prescribed in Article 5.1. If the Contract is earlier surrendered or
         terminated, the Contractor shall provide such descriptions a minimum of
         30 days before relinquishment.

         The relinquishment shall be in accordance with the requirements and
         obligations relating to site restoration, to the extent herein
         applicable, as set forth in any applicable law, rule or regulation in
         effect from time to time. The Contractor shall remain responsible for
         any losses, damages and liabilities arising under any claim, demand,
         action or proceeding arising from the conduct of Petroleum Operations
         prior to the date of the relinquishment in accordance with this
         Contract and any applicable laws, rules and regulations in effect at
         the time such Petroleum Operations are performed from time to time.

5.4      The area designated for relinquishment shall consist as far as
         practicable of rectangular blocks not less than five square kilometres
         in area and bounded by lines running due north and south and due east
         and west. The area designated for relinquishment need not consist of
         one contiguous tract. Contractor shall use its best efforts to
         designate non-contiguous tracts in such manner that subsequent
         Petroleum Operations on the relinquished tracts are not unreasonably
         impeded.

         relinquishments of a part only of the Contract Area. Any such voluntary
         relinquishment of less than all of the Contract Area shall be credited
         toward any subsequent relinquishment obligations hereunder.
         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no
         relinquishment of all or part of the the Contract Area shall relieve
         the Contractor of its obligations under Article 8, Minimum Woek
         Programme.

         in his absence, his alternate) from each Party shall be the spokesman
         on behalf of such Party and shall cast a single vote.

         The first chairman of the Co-ordination Committee shall be the chief
         representative of the Contractor (or his alternate) and the first vice
         chairman shall be the chief representative of Georgian Oil (or his

         chairman by sending a notice to the Parties. Other meetings, if
         necessary, may be held at any time at the request of Georgian Oil or
         the Contractor. In each case, the secretary shall give the Parties at
         least 30 Days notice (or such shorter period as the Parties may agree)
         of the proposed meeting date, the time and location of the meeting.

6.4      The Parties hereby empower the Co-ordination Committee to:

                  the case of a Work Programme to give effect to the provisions
                  of a Development Plan, it is consistent with the requirements
                  of that Development Plan as approved or deemed to have been
                  approved by the Coordination Committee;

                  as submitted by the Contractor, or as the case may be, as
                  amended in accordance with the Contractor's proposal, would
                  satisfy the requirements relating to Development Plans set out
                  in Article 9.

         6.6.3    A determination by a Sole Expert of a disagreement referred to
                  him under Article 6.6.2 shall be final and binding on the
                  Parties with effect that the proposal submitted by the
                  Contractor to the Coordination Committee will be deemed to
                  have been approved, or as the case may be, rejected, provided,
                  however, that if the proposal seeking approval of a
                  Development Plan is deemed to have been rejected the
                  Contractor at its election shall either as soon as practicable
                  after the determination of the Sole Expert has been
                  communicated to the Parties submit an alternative proposal or
                  inform Georgian Oil that the discovery to which the
                  Development Plan relates is no longer considered by the
                  Contractor to be commercial.

6.4      A matter which requires urgent handling may be decided by the
         Co-ordination Committee without convening a meeting, with the
         Co-ordination Committee making decisions through telexes, e-mail, or
         faxes or the circulation of documents, subsequently confirmed in
         writing by the chief representative from each party.

6.8      The Co-ordination Committee shall nominate a secretary, to record
         minutes of the meetings of the Co-ordination Committee. The secretary
         shall take a record of each proposal voted on and the results of such
         vote at each meeting of the Co-ordination Committee. Each
         representative of the Parties shall sign and be provided with a copy of
         such record at the end of such meeting. The secretary shall provide
         each Party with a copy of the minutes of each meeting of the
         Co-ordination Committee within thirty (30) Days after the end of such
         meeting. Each Party shall thereafter have a period of fifteen (15) Days
         to give notice of any objections to the minutes to the secretary.
         Failure to give notice within the said fifteen (15) Day period shall be
         deemed approval of those minutes. In any event the record of proposals
         voted on to be provided at the end of each meeting shall be conclusive
         and take precedence

                                       29

         over the minutes. The Co-ordination Committee shall provide the State
         Agency with a copy of the approved minutes.

6.9      All costs and expenses incurred with respect to the activities of the
         Co-ordination Committee shall be paid or reimbursed by the Contractor
         and shall be Costs and Expenses in accordance with the Accounting
         Procedures.

                             MINIMUM WORK PROGRAMME

8.1      The Contractor shall perform the Minimum Work Programme, as set forth
         in Article 8.2, and shall complete said Minimum Work Programme not
         later than 12 months after the Effective Date.

8.2      The Minimum Work Programme shall consist of:

         8.2.1    Within 12 months of the Effective Date, Contractor will
                  undertake to shoot and process seismic at a cost of $1.25
                  million which may be up to 200 km of new data.

         8.2.2    Within 12 months of the Effective Date, the Contractor will
                  carry out rehabilitation work in the Development Areas on the
                  Samgori, Patardzeuli, South Dome and Krtsanisi Fields
                  (outlined in red on the map in Annex B) to the value of $0.75
                  million.

         8.2.3    Within 18 months of the Effective Date, the Contractor will
                  complete a technical and economic evaluation of all known oil
                  or gas discoveries in the Contract Area. In the event that the
                  Contractor concludes that any such discovery may result in a
                  Commercial Discovery, then the procedures described in Article
                  9 shall apply. In the event that the Contractor concludes that
                  any such discovery would not lead to a Commercial Discovery,
                  then the area of the discovery shall be relinquished at the
                  first opportunity, unless there is demonstrable prospectivity
                  in horizons above or below the discovery horizon.

         8.2.4    Financing of the Minimum Work Programme will be guaranteed by
                  a stand-by Letter of Credit for $2 million. The Letter of
                  Credit will be made out in favour of the State Agency for
                  payment not before 31st _______2002 according to either of the
                  following terms and conditions:

                  (i)      Default or partial default in execution of the
                           Minimum Work Programme

                  (ii)     Termination of the Contract as per the provisions of
                           Article 29.2.2

<PAGE>

                  The value of the Letter of Credit will be automatically
                  reduced by the amount of any payment made by NPL on account of
                  the Minimum Work Programme. All payments must be made by NPL's
                  bank, make reference to the Letter of Credit, and be approved
                  by the Co-ordination Committee and the State Agency.

8.3      After the completion of the acquisition of the initial seismic data
         (and additional seismic data, if deemed necessary by the Contractor),
         the Contractor may, within 18 Months of the Effective Date, present to
         the Coordination Committee an Exploration or Appraisal Programme,
         which, if necessary, may provide for the drilling of an exploration or
         appraisal well, the depth of such will be defined by the seismic data
         as determined by Contractor, and shall commence such Exploration or
         Appraisal Programme, as approved by the Coordination Committee, within
         24 Months of the Effective Date.

                  8.4   If the Contractor fails to present such an Exploration
            or Appraisal Programme because the Contractor has determined that
            the seismic surveys have not defined one or more structures with
            sufficient commercial potential to justify at least an exploration
            or appraisal well of the type described above, then Georgian Oil and
            the Contractor shall discuss in good faith on how to proceed. If no
            agreement is reached concerning a mutually acceptable Exploration
            Programme then all the areas outside the Development Areas shall be
            relinquished within three (3) years

8.5      If an exploration well is drilled as aforesaid and the Contractor
         concludes therefrom that there are significant quantities of Petroleum
         which may result in a Commercial Discovery and gives a notice under
         Article 9.1, then the provisions of Article 9.2 shall apply.

8.6      Upon completion of an Exploration or Appraisal Programme which has
         resulted in the drilling of a well, the Contractor, at its option,
         shall have the right to continue an Exploration Programme in the
         Contract Area for two (2) years. If as a result of this additional
         Exploration Programme, the Contractor believes therefrom that there are

                                       34
<PAGE>

         not sufficient quantities of Petroleum to lead to a Commercial
         Discovery, then Georgian Oil and the Contractor shall discuss in good
         faith on how to proceed with further exploration under this Contract.
         Subsequently, if no agreement is reached concerning a mutually
         acceptable Exploration Programme then all the areas outside the
         Development Areas shall be relinquished within 3 (three) years.
         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if there
         exists a conflict in the provisions of this Article 8 and the
         relinquishment provisions required under Article 5.1, then the
         provisions of Article 5.1 shall prevail.

8.7      Commencing with the operations described in this Article, Contractor
         shall use its reasonable and diligent efforts to reduce the timing of
         the implementation of the operations consistent with Good Oil Field
         Practices.

8.8      Contractor shall, with respect to any report or proposal it submits to
         the Coordination Committee pursuant to this Article 8, submit a copy at
         the same time to Georgian Oil and to State Agency.

8.9      At the request of the State Agency, the Contractor agrees to meet with
         the State Agency for consultative purposes concerning regulatory issues
         related to Work Programmes.

8.10     It is agreed that the Samgori, Patardzeuli, South Dome and Krtsanisi
         Fields (outlined in red on the map in Annex B) are Development Areas as
         of the Effective Date.

8.11     The Contractor will diligently continue rehabilitation work in the
         Development Areas throughout the term of the Contract or until, in the
         Contractor's view, production declines to an uneconomic level, in order
         to achieve the most efficient rate of production for the fields. If the
         Contractor determines that production from such Development Areas has
         declined to an uneconomic level, then the Contractor shall immediately
         relinquish any such uneconomic Development Areas. Nothing in this
         Article 8.11 should prevent the Contractor suspending operations
         temporarily through cyclical falls in the price of oil or gas.

                            PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL OF
                         APPRAISAL AND DEVELOPMENT PLANS

9.1      If the Contractor, following the drilling of any exploration well,
         concludes therefrom that there are significant quantities of Petroleum
         which may result in a Commercial Discovery, the Contractor will notify
         the Coordination Committee within 45 Days of the completion of the well
         that it intends to prepare an Appraisal Programme for presentation to
         the Coordination Committee. In addition to the foregoing the
         Contractor, should it wish to carry out appraisal work in any part of
         the Contract Area, shall present to the Coordination Committee a
         proposed Appraisal Programme. The proposed Appraisal Programme shall
         specify, in reasonable detail, the work proposed to be carried out by
         the Contractor, including seismic work, drilling of wells and technical
         studies, and the estimated timetable within which such work will be
         conducted, including commencement and completion dates.

9.2      The Contractor shall carry out the Appraisal Programme as approved or
         deemed to be approved by the Coordination Committee. Within ninety (90)
         Days after completion of such Appraisal Programme, the Contractor shall
         provide to the Coordination Committee a schedule describing the
         estimated completion of the laboratory and other studies' completion to
         enable Contractor to submit to the Coordination Committee a
         comprehensive evaluation report on the Appraisal Programme. Such
         evaluation report shall include, but not be limited to, geological
         conditions, such as structural configuration, physical properties and
         extent of reservoir rocks, pressure, volume and temperature analysis of
         the reservoir fluid, fluid characteristics, including gravity of liquid
         hydrocarbons, sulphur percentage, sediment and water percentage, and
         product yield pattern, Natural Gas composition, production forecasts
         (per well and per Reservoir), and estimates of recoverable reserves.

9.3      Together with any evaluation report submitted in accordance with
         Article 9.2 or at any other time together with a reasonably detailed
         report supporting one of the following statements, the Contractor shall
         submit to the Coordination Committee a written declaration, including
         one of the following statements:

         9.3.1    that the Contractor believes that Commercial Production from
                  the Appraisal Area is feasible;

         9.3.2    that the Contractor believes that Commercial Production from
                  the Appraisal Area is not feasible; or

         9.3.3    that Commercial Production can be determined only after
                  further specified work that the Contractor commits to carry
                  out under a further Appraisal Programme in specified areas
                  within or outside the relevant Appraisal Area. The Contractor
                  shall submit such an Appraisal Programme to the Coordination
                  Committee within 90 days from submission of the above
                  declaration.

9.4      In the event that the Contractor makes a statement under Article 9.3.3,
         the Contractor shall be entitled to retain the relevant Appraisal Area
         temporarily pending the completion with reasonable diligence of the
         further work committed by the Contractor under said Article, at which
         time the Contractor shall advise the Coordination Committee of its
         conclusion as to whether or not there is in fact a new Commercial
         Discovery and the provisions of Article 9.3.1 or Article 9.3.2 shall be
         applied accordingly.

9.5      If the Contractor states pursuant to Article 9.3.1 that it believes
         that Commercial Production is feasible, the Contractor shall submit to
         the Coordination Committee for review and approval a proposed
         Development Plan in respect of the relevant Commercial Discovery. The
         Development Plan shall be submitted within 3 to 12 months of such
         declaration, depending on the complexity of the development. The
         Contractor, with any assistance requested of the Operating Company,
         shall proceed promptly and diligently to prepare the Development Plan
         and, if the Development Plan is approved or deemed to be approved by
         the Coordination Committee as herein provided, implement it in
         accordance with Good Oilfield Practices.

                           affect the economic and technical feasibility of the
                           Development Plan;

                  (v)      provide details of the Contractor's proposals for the
                           employment and training of citizens of Georgia; and

                  (vi)     include an abandonment and site restoration programme
                           and a funding procedure for such programme in
                           accordance with the requirements of Article 9.7.

9.7      Subject to the limitation set forth in Article 24.3, each abandonment
         and site restoration programme included in a Development Plan shall:

         9.7.1    describe removal and abandonment measures deemed necessary in
                  accordance with Good Oilfield Practices following completion
                  of production from the relevant Development Area together with
                  an estimate of the costs thereof. The abandonment plan shall
                  provide for the removal of facilities and equipment used in
                  Petroleum Operations or their in place abandonment, if
                  appropriate, in the Development Area and insofar as practical
                  restoration of used areas to a condition as defined in the
                  Development Plan. For the sake of clarity, it shall be
                  understood that the intent is to restore, insofar as
                  practical, to conditions which were shown in the environmental
                  baseline studies referred to in Article 24.3; and

         9.7.2    establish in respect of the measures described in 9.7.1 above
                  an abandonment and site restoration fund estimated from time
                  to time to be sufficient to fund those measures and placed in
                  a special interest bearing US$ account ("the Special
                  Account"), to be held in the joint names of the State Agency
                  and the Contractor and dedicated exclusively to meeting
                  expenditures for abandonment and site restoration. Except as
                  provided in Article 17.4 of the Petroleum Law, no taxes shall
                  be imposed on any amounts paid into, received or earned by, or
                  held in the Special Account and payments made into the Special
                  Account by the Contractor shall be treated as expenses
                  recoverable as Costs and Expenses.

9.8      Discharge of abandonment obligations:

         9.8.1    Unless, not later than one Year prior to date on which the
                  rights of the Contractor under this Contract will terminate,
                  the State has informed the Contractor by notice in writing
                  that on termination another contractor, or Georgian Oil, will
                  take over the Development Area as a going concern, the
                  Contractor will be responsible for carrying out the
                  abandonment and site restoration programme here in this
                  Article described proceeding with all due diligence and in the
                  event that the funds available in the special interest bearing
                  account are insufficient for that purpose, will make up the
                  shortfall.

         9.8.2    In respect of the obligations of the Contractor under Article
                  9.8.1, this Contract shall, notwithstanding the provision of
                  Article 4, remain in force until the Contractor has discharged
                  those obligations in full, and for that purpose the provisions
                  of Article 30 shall continue to be applicable.

         9.8.3    If the State gives the Contractor a notice of the kind
                  referred to in Article 9.8.1 the Contractor shall have no
                  further responsibility for carrying out the abandonment and
                  site restoration programme and title to the funds in the
                  Special Account shall vest exclusively in the State Agency.

         9.8.4    If the Contractor has discharged in full its obligations under
                  Article 9.8.1 and surplus funds remain in the Special Account
                  after meeting the related costs, such surplus shall first be
                  used to recover any unrecovered Costs and Expenses and any
                  surplus shall be divided between the Contractor and Georgian
                  Oil in proportions which correspond to the proportions in
                  which the Contractor and Georgian Oil have shared cumulative
                  Profit Oil.

9.9      Any significant changes to an approved Development Plan or proposals
         related to extension of a Development Area or for enhanced recovery
         projects shall be submitted to the Coordination Committee for approval.

9.10     Subject to the terms of this Contract, the Contractor shall carry out,
         at its own expense and financial risk, all the necessary Petroleum
         Operations to implement an approved Development Plan. However, if the
         Contractor is able to demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the
         Coordination Committee that exploitation turns out not to be
         commercially profitable, the Coordination Committee shall decide on the
         steps to be taken as a consequence of such an event, and the Contractor
         shall not be obligated to continue implementation of the original
         Development Plan.

9.11     Contractor shall, with respect to any report or proposal it submits to
         the Coordination Committee pursuant to this Article 9, submit a copy at
         the same time to Georgian Oil and to the State Agency in compliance
         with the regulations of the State Agency in force from time to time.

9.12     At the request of the State Agency, the Contractor agrees to meet with
         the State Agency for consultative purposes concerning regulatory issues
         related to Work Programmes.

         approved Annual Work Programmes and Budgets. Such activities may be
         delegated to the Operating Company.

10.2     Within ninety (90) Days after the Effective Date, the Contractor shall
         submit to the Co-ordination Committee for its approval an Annual Work
         Programme and Budget for the remainder of the then current Calendar
         Year and a forecast for the next succeeding Calendar Year.

10.3     Before 31 October in each Calendar Year, the Contractor shall prepare
         and submit to the Co-ordination Committee for its review a proposed
         Annual Work Programme and Budget for the next Calendar Year. Article
         6.4 shall apply to the approval of Annual Work Programmes and Budgets
         and modifications thereto.

10.4     In connection with the review and approval of an Annual Work Programme
         and Budget, the Contractor shall submit to the Co-ordination Committee
         such supporting data as may be requested by the Co-ordination
         Committee.

10.5     Subject to the provisions of Article 6.4, the Contractor may, in
         accordance with the following provisions, incur expenditures in excess
         of an approved Budget or expenditures outside an approved Budget in
         carrying out an approved Work Programme, provided that the objectives
         in the approved Work Programme are not substantially changed, subject
         to the following conditions:

         (i)      In carrying out an approved Annual Work Programme the
                  Contractor may, if necessary, incur excess expenditures of no
                  more than ten percent (10%) of the approved Budget in any
                  specified budgetary category. The Contractor

<PAGE>

                  shall report quarterly the aggregate amount of all such excess
                  expenditures to the Co-ordination Committee for information.

         (ii)     For the efficient performance of Petroleum Operations, the
                  Contractor may, without approval, undertake certain individual
                  projects which are not included in an approved Annual Work
                  Programme and Budget, for a maximum expenditure of two hundred
                  and fifty thousand US$ (US$250,000) per Calendar Year, but

                  information.

         (iii)    Excess expenditures under this Article 10.5 shall not exceed
                  five percent (5%) of the approved or modified annual Budget
                  for the Calendar Year. If such excess is expected to be in
                  excess of said five percent (5%) of the approved total annual
                  Budget, the Contractor shall present its reasons therefor to
                  the Co-ordination Committee and obtain its approval prior to
                  incurring such expenditures.

                 ALLOCATION OF PRODUCTION, RECOVERY OF COSTS AND
                EXPENSES, PRODUCTION SHARING, AND RIGHT OF EXPORT

11.1     The Contractor shall provide or procure the provision of all resources,
         including funds, required to conduct Petroleum Operations under
         approved Annual Work Programmes under this Contract, except as
         otherwise provided in this Contract, and the Contractor shall be
         entitled to recover its Costs and Expenses from Petroleum produced from
         the Contract Area as provided below.

11.2     Prior Costs and Expenses and Prior Cost Recovery Petroleum

         11.2.1   Cost and Expenses incurred by the Contractor or IVOG in
                  connection with Petroleum Operations prior to the Effective
                  Date and summarised in Annex F shall be deemed to be Costs and
                  Expenses for the purposes of this Contract and shall be deemed
                  to be incurred on the Effective Date and shall be fully
                  recoverable from Cost Recovery Petroleum in accordance with
                  the provisions of this Contract.

         11.2.2   Costs and Expenses incurred by the Contractor between 1
                  January 2000 and the Effective Date, but not included in Annex
                  F, shall be audited as soon as possible thereafter. Subject to
                  approval by the Co-ordination Committee and the State Agency,
                  such Costs and Expenses shall be deemed to be Costs and
                  Expenses for the purposes of this Contract and shall be deemed
                  to be incurred on the Effective Date and shall be fully
                  recoverable from Cost Recovery Petroleum in accordance with
                  the provisions of this Contract.

         11.2.3   Cost Recovery Petroleum taken by the Contractor in connection
                  with Petroleum Operations prior to the Effective Date and
                  summarised in Annex F shall be deemed to be Cost Recovery
                  Petroleum for the purposes of this Contract and shall be
                  deemed to have been taken on the Effective Date

                                       44

11.3     The Contractor shall have the right to use free of charge Petroleum
         produced from the Contract Area to the extent required for Petroleum
         Operations under the Contract. The amount of Petroleum which the
         Contractor shall be entitled to use for Petroleum Operations shall not
         exceed the amount which would be expected to be used in accordance with
         international Petroleum industry practice in the exercise of Good
         Oilfield Practices. For the avoidance of doubt, such Petroleum shall be
         used only for the benefit of Petroleum Operations and not for the
         personal gain of any Party.

11.4     Available Crude Oil and Available Natural Gas shall be measured at the
         applicable Measurement Point and allocated as set forth below in
         Articles 11.5 and 11.10.

11.5     The Contractor shall be entitled to recover all Costs and Expenses
         incurred in respect of Petroleum Operations from a maximum of fifty
         percent (50%) per Calendar Quarter of all Available Crude Oil and
         Available Natural Gas from the Contract Area (hereinafter referred to
         as Cost Recovery Crude Oil and Cost Recovery Natural Gas, as the case
         may be).

         Recovery of Costs and Expenses shall be in a manner consistent with the
         Accounting Procedure and Article 11.6.

11.6     Costs and Expenses shall be recoverable from Cost Recovery Petroleum on
         a first in, first out basis (i.e. Costs and Expenses incurred will be
         recovered according to the date they were incurred, earliest first and
         measured in US$ in accordance with Article 18.1) and shall be
         calculated on a Calendar Quarter basis.

11.7     To the extent that in a Calendar Quarter outstanding recoverable Costs
         and Expenses related to the Contract Area exceed the value of all Cost
         Recovery Crude Oil and Cost Recovery Natural Gas for such Calendar
         Quarter, the excess shall be carried forward for recovery in the next
         succeeding Calendar Quarters until fully recovered, but in no case
         after termination of the Contract. In amplification of the foregoing a
         full audit shall be undertaken in every Calendar Year to ensure
         compliance, among other matters, with the principles of Article 11.5.

                                       45
<PAGE>

11.8     Recovery of Costs and Expenses shall be achieved by transferring to a
         Party at the Measurement Point title to quantities of Cost Recovery
         Petroleum of equivalent value (determined in accordance with Article
         12) to the Costs and Expenses to be recovered in accordance with this
         Article 11. [No change]

11.9     To the extent that the value of Cost Recovery Petroleum received by a
         Party from the Contract Area during a Calendar Quarter is greater or
         less than the Party was entitled to receive for that Calendar Quarter,
         an appropriate adjustment shall be made in accordance with the
         Accounting Procedure in the subsequent Calendar Quarters.

11.10    Following recovery of Costs and Expenses from Cost Recovery Petroleum
         in each Calendar Quarter in accordance with the provisions of this
         Article 11, the remaining Petroleum, including any portion of Cost
         Recovery Petroleum not then required or available for recovery of Costs
         and Expenses (hereinafter referred to as "Profit Oil" or "Profit
         Natural Gas") shall be allocated in each Calendar Quarter between
         Georgian Oil and the Contractor as follows:

         11.10.1  Fifty percent (50%) of the Profit Oil (and Profit Natural Gas)
                  resulting from Petroleum Operations will be allocated to
                  Georgian Oil and fifty percent (50%) to the Contractor, so
                  long as the cumulative Costs and Expenses, plus finance costs
                  incurred by the Contractor exceed the value of the cumulative
                  Cost Recovery Petroleum, cumulative Profit Oil and cumulative
                  Profit Natural Gas given to the Contractor, calculated from
                  the Effective Date to the end of the prior quarter.

         11.10.2  If at any time the value of the cumulative Cost Recovery
                  Petroleum, cumulative Profit Oil and cumulative Profit Natural
                  Gas delivered to the Contractor exceeds the cumulative Costs
                  and Expenses, plus interest incurred by the Contractor (but
                  excluding interest already included in Costs and Expenses and
                  excluding interest on interest), then seventy percent (70%) of
                  the Profit Oil (and Profit Natural Gas) resulting from
                  Petroleum Operations will be allocated to Georgian Oil and
                  thirty percent

                                       46
<PAGE>

                  (30%) to the Contractor, calculated from the Effective Date to
                  the end of the prior quarter.

11.11    Notwithstanding Articles 11.5 and 11.10, when the value of the
         cumulative Cost Recovery Petroleum, cumulative Profit Oil and
         cumulative Profit Natural Gas delivered to the Contractor exceeds the
         cumulative Costs and Expenses, plus finance costs incurred by the
         Contractor, and calculated from the Effective Date to the end of the
         prior quarter, then Georgian Oil will be entitled to receive, as a
         priority, up to 250,000 tons of oil (or oil equivalent) from a maximum
         of fifty percent (50%) per Calendar Quarter of all Available Crude Oil
         and Available Natural Gas from the Contract Area (the Base Level Oil).

         11.11.1  During the period that Base Level Oil is being delivered to
                  Georgian Oil, the Contractor shall be entitled to recover all
                  Costs and Expenses, calculated from the Effective Date to the
                  end of the prior quarter incurred in respect of Petroleum
                  Operations, as Cost Recovery Petroleum from a maximum of fifty
                  percent (50%) per Calendar Quarter of the remaining Available
                  Crude.

         11.11.2  During the period that Base Level Oil is being delivered to
                  Georgian Oil, after delivery of Base Level Oil and Cost
                  Recovery Petroleum the remaining Available Crude Oil and
                  Available Natural Gas resulting from Petroleum Operations in
                  the Contract Area will be allocated as Profit Oil (and Profit
                  Natural Gas) with fifty percent (50%) being delivered to
                  Georgian Oil and fifty percent (50%) being delivered to the
                  Contractor.

11.12    The Contractor shall prepare and provide to Georgian Oil and the State
         Agency not less than ninety (90) Days prior to the beginning of each
         Calendar Quarter a written

                                       47
<PAGE>

         forecast setting out the total quantity of Petroleum that the
         Contractor estimates can be produced and saved hereunder during each of
         the next four (4) Calendar Quarters in accordance with Good Oilfield
         Practices and the Annual Work Programme approved in accordance with
         Article 10.

11.13    Crude Oil, whether as Cost Recovery Petroleum or as Profit Oil, shall
         be measured at the Measurement Point for purposes of the Contract and
         delivered to Georgian Oil and Contractor who as owners shall take in
         kind, assume risk of loss and separately dispose of their respective
         entitlements of Crude Oil. All Natural Gas shall be sold on a jointly
         committed basis or as otherwise provided in accordance with Article 16
         of this Contract.

11.14    For the avoidance of any doubt, title to their relevant shares of
         Petroleum shall pass from the State to Georgian Oil and Contractor as
         appropriate at the Measurement Point and the Operating Company will
         have no title to any Petroleum.

         Georgian Oil and the Contractor shall agree on procedures for taking
         volumes of Crude Oil corresponding to their respective entitlements on
         a regular basis and in a manner that is appropriate having regard to
         the respective destinations and uses of the Crude Oil, all in
         accordance with the provisions of this Contract. If necessary, Georgian
         Oil and the Contractor will enter into a lifting agreement setting out
         the agreed procedures for taking volumes of Crude Oil, and such
         agreement shall comply with the principles of Good Oilfield Practices.

         Details of all Costs and Expenses approved as herein provided shall be
         given by the Contractor to the State Agency and Georgian Oil on a
         quarterly basis.

                       CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS VALUATION

12.1     The value of Crude Oil that constitutes Cost Recovery Crude Oil and is
         sold by Contractor to Third Parties in "fairly valued" transactions
         shall be the net realised price (i.e., after deducting commissions and
         brokerages) ex works at the Measurement Point. The sale is "fairly
         valued" if

         (i)      the price is the sole consideration for the sale; and

         (ii)     the terms of the sale are not affected by any commercial
                  relationship, other than that created by the contract of sale
                  itself, between the seller or an Affiliate and the buyer or an
                  Affiliate; and

         (iii)    the seller or an Affiliate does not have any interest in the
                  subsequent resale or disposal of the Crude Oil or any product
                  derived therefrom.

12.2     It is the intent of the Parties that the value of Cost Recovery
         Petroleum that is sold by Contractor other than to Third Parties in
         "fairly valued" transactions shall reflect the prevailing international
         market price for Crude Oil saved and sold from the Contract Area ex
         works the Measurement Point. For the purpose of determining the value
         and allocation of Cost Recovery Petroleum taken and disposed of by the
         Parties and/or their assignees under this Contract during each Calendar
         Quarter, Georgian Oil and the Contractor shall agree upon a basket of
         no more than four (4) Crude Oils freely traded in international
         markets, and the value of Cost Recovery Petroleum shall be adjusted to
         reflect the weighted average daily f.o.b. prices for term contract
         sales from Petroleum producing countries in international markets for
         the same Calendar Quarter of such basket of Crude Oils, it being
         understood that the following principles will apply:

         (i)      Each of such basket marker Crude Oils shall originate from the
                  closest

                                       49
<PAGE>

                  geographic location to the Contract Area as possible and have
                  the same primary geographic market as the Contract Area Crude
                  Oil being valued. The weighted average of the basket shall be
                  such that the average gravity, sulphur content and product
                  yield of the basket and the average gravity, sulphur content
                  and product yield of the Crude Oil produced under this
                  Contract shall approximate each other as nearly as is
                  possible; and

         (ii)     The prices for individual referenced Crude Oil markers used
                  within the basket shall be based upon the numerical average of
                  a daily report of the actual price for each referenced Crude
                  Oil marker as published in agreed internationally recognised
                  publications; and

         (iii)    Adjustment provisions will be incorporated into the basket
                  formula to take account of transportation costs and location
                  differentials between the marker basket of Crude Oils and the
                  Crude Oil produced under this Contract arriving at a
                  designated sales point (where the sales point is not the
                  Measurement Point) and to take account of gravity and sulphur
                  content variation beyond a pre-agreed range; and

         (iv)     Contractor's third party fairly valued sales prices received
                  for Crude Oil produced under this Contract shall be the basis
                  used to determine appropriate changes to the adjustments set
                  out in (iii) above;

         (v)      Unless agreed otherwise, the last calculated weighted average
                  basket price shall serve as the provisional price for a
                  Calendar Quarter until a new price is determined.

12.3     In the event that Georgian Oil and the Contractor are unable to agree
         upon the

                                       50
<PAGE>

         basket of Crude Oils envisaged in Article 12.2 above, or the principles
         relating thereto, then either Georgian Oil or the Contractor or both of
         them jointly may pursuant to Article 30, refer the matter or matters in
         issue for determination by a Sole Expert. Pending such determination,
         the price shall be as determined under Article 12.2 (iv) above.

12.4     Natural Gas shall be valued at the actual revenues received by
         Contractor less transportation, storage, treatment, processing,
         liquefaction and all other associated costs incurred by the Contractor
         beyond the Measurement Point in supplying Natural gas to customers
         beyond the Measurement Point. If the Contractor bears the cost of
         installing and operating the pipeline required to transport Natural Gas
         produced from the Contract Area to the market for such Natural Gas and
         such pipeline is located downstream of the Measurement Point, the
         Contractor shall be entitled to deduct a tariff from the sales price of
         the Natural Gas for the purpose of determining the value of Cost
         Recovery Petroleum. The tariff associated with such natural gas
         pipeline shall be computed on the basis of the investment incurred in
         such pipeline, the operating costs of such pipeline and a reasonable
         return on Contractor's investment.

13.7     It is recognised by the Parties that in order to maximise the benefit
         of Petroleum Operations to the State, Georgian Oil and the Contractor,
         it is in the interests of the State to promote cooperation among
         Georgian and foreign enterprises carrying on Petroleum Operations in
         Georgia to share infrastructure in such a manner as to ensure efficient
         operation among themselves. The State Agency and Georgian Oil, at their
         discretion, hereby agree to seek to promote, using reasonable efforts
         under the circumstances, subject to contractual commitments, treaty
         obligations and the

                                       54
<PAGE>

         rights of Third Parties, access for the Contractor to any existing, new
         or modernised pipelines or other infrastructure including sea ports and
         rail terminals, passing through or in Georgia which may be constructed
         or upgraded during the term of the Contract on terms with regard to
         access and tariffs no less favourable than the then prevailing terms
         available to private commercial Third Parties, namely non-State owned
         or controlled entities, for comparable usage, excluding any contractors
         or participants of said construction or upgrading.

13.8     The Contractor shall be entitled to bring Foreign Employees into
         Georgia in connection with the performance of Petroleum Operations. The
         entry into Georgia of such personnel is hereby authorised, and the

<PAGE>

         (vii)    contact and instruct appropriate departments and ministries of
                  the State and any other bodies controlled by the State to do
                  all things, within and according to their authority, necessary
                  to help expedite such Petroleum Operations;

         (viii)   provide permits, approvals, and land use rights, in accordance
                  with applicable rules and regulations, requested by the

                  and

         (ix)     provide to the Contractor existing data and samples concerning
                  the Contract Area useful for the conduct of such Petroleum
                  Operations, other than those produced as a result of Petroleum
                  Operations hereunder.

14.2     The State may charge as Administrative Fees for such assistance such
         reasonable amounts as may be customary for the provision of such
         services, but in no event shall such charges be in excess of charges
         applicable to Third Parties for comparable service or assistance. It is
         also understood that with respect to a number of matters such as the
         conversion of currency and the provision of accommodations, for
         example, the State may also have to secure the services of private
         Third Parties.

14.3     Notwithstanding anything in this Contract to the contrary, the
         Contractor agrees to pay the fees described in Article 14.2 to the
         State Agency, together with reimbursement to the State Agency for all
         direct expenses incurred by it in preparing and making necessary
         applications to ministries, state agencies and other governmental
         authorities in the course of obtaining permits and approval required
         for the Contractor and/or the Operating Company to conduct Petroleum
         Operations. Such direct expenses may include the cost of retaining
         experts to review or prepare technical submissions (e.g., environmental
         or engineering data). But in no event

                                       58
<PAGE>

         shall the State Agency charge for additional compensation, if any, to
         its personnel for performing such services. Other direct expense items
         shall include, but not be limited to, copying or printing of
         applications and supporting data submitted to other governmental
         bodies, transportation and hall rental for public hearings required by
         laws or authorities other than those of the State Agency itself, and
         similar items that the State Agency cannot reasonably provide through
         its own resources.

14.4     Fees and direct expenses paid under Articles 14.2, 14.3 and 14.5 shall
         be treated as Costs and Expenses for the purposes of determining Cost
         Recovery Petroleum.

14.5     The contractor pays regulatory fee to the State Agency for Regulation
         of Oil and Gas Resources, in the amount of USD 150.000, the half of the

14.6     Contrctor shall pay all fees and charges in compliance with the
         normative acts promulgated by the State Agency, provided that such fees
         and charges are not discriminatory with respect to the Contractor. Such
         fees and charges shall be Costs and Expenses for the purposes of
         determining Cost Recovery Petroleum.

                            MEASUREMENT OF PETROLEUM

15.1     All Petroleum produced, Saved and not used in the Petroleum Operations
         in accordance with Article 11.3 shall be measured at the Measurement
         Point. Georgian Oil and State Agency shall be afforded access to the
         Measurement Point by Contractor as long as such access does not
         significantly interfere with Petroleum Operations.

15.2     The Measurement Point shall be at the end of the facilities for which
         the costs are included as Costs and Expenses. The Measurement Point
         shall be determined in accordance with the provisions set out in
         Articles 9 and 11.

15.3     All Petroleum shall be measured in accordance with standards generally
         acceptable in the international Petroleum industry and certified
         Georgian standards. All measurement equipment shall be installed,
         maintained and operated by the Contractor. The Contractor and Georgian
         Oil and State Agency shall be entitled periodically to inspect the
         measuring equipment installed and all charts and other measurement or
         test data at all reasonable times. The accuracy of measuring equipment
         shall be verified by tests at regular intervals and upon request by
         State Agency or Georgian Oil or the Contractor, using means and methods
         generally accepted in the international Petroleum industry.

15.4     Should a meter malfunction occur, the Contractor shall immediately have
         the meter repaired, adjusted and corrected and following such repairs,
         adjustment or correction shall have it tested or calibrated to
         establish its accuracy. Upon the discovery of metering error, the
         Contractor shall have the meter tested immediately and shall take the
         necessary steps to correct any error that may be discovered.

15.5     In the event a measuring error is discovered, the Contractor shall use
         all reasonable efforts to determine the correct production figures for
         the period during which there

                                       60
<PAGE>

         was a measuring error and correct previously used readings. The
         Contractor shall submit to the Co-ordination Committee and State Agency
         a report on the corrections carried out. In determining the correction,
         the Contractor shall use, where required, the information from other
         measurements made inside or outside the Development Area. If it proves
         impossible to determine when the measuring error first occurred, the
         commencement of the error shall be deemed to be the point in time
         halfway between the date of the last previous test and the date on
         which the existence of the measuring error was first discovered.

15.6     All measurements for all purposes in this Contract shall be adjusted to
         standard conditions of pressure at sea level and temperature at sixty
         (60) degrees Fahrenheit.

         16.1.1   Associated Natural Gas produced within the Contract Area shall
                  be used primarily for purposes related to the Production
                  Operations and production enhancement, including, without
                  limitation, oil treating, gas injection, gas lifting and power
                  generation.

         16.1.2   Based on the principle of full utilisation of the Associated
                  Natural Gas and with no impediment to normal production of the
                  Crude Oil, any Development Plan shall include a plan of
                  utilisation of Associated Natural Gas. If there is any excess
                  Associated Natural Gas remaining in any Oil Field after
                  utilisation pursuant to Article 16.1.1 (hereafter referred to
                  as "Excess Associated Natural Gas"), the Contractor shall
                  carry out a feasibility study regarding the commercial
                  utilisation of such Excess Associated Natural Gas.

                  If Georgian Oil and the Contractor agree that Excess
                  Associated Natural Gas has no commercial value, then such
                  Natural Gas shall be disposed of by the Contractor through
                  reinjection, venting, flaring or otherwise as may be provided
                  in an approved Development Plan, and subject to approval from
                  the State Agency.

                  If Georgian Oil and the Contractor agree that Excess
                  Associated Natural Gas has commercial value, they will
                  endeavour to enter into gas sales agreement(s) and/or other
                  commercial and/or technical arrangements with Third Parties
                  required to develop such Natural Gas. Investments in the
                  facilities necessary for production, transportation and
                  delivery of Excess Associated Natural Gas shall be made by the
                  Contractor.

                  If either Georgian Oil or the Contractor considers that Excess
                  Associated Natural Gas has commercial value while the other
                  considers that Excess Associated Natural Gas has no commercial
                  value, the one who considers Excess Associated Natural Gas to
                  have commercial value may utilise such Excess Associated
                  Natural Gas, at its own cost and expense and without impeding
                  the production of Crude Oil and without affecting the shares
                  of Crude Oil and Natural Gas otherwise to be allocated under
                  the other provisions of this Contract, but if such Excess
                  Associated Natural Gas is not so utilised at any time or from
                  time to time, then such Excess Associated Natural Gas shall be
                  disposed of by the Contractor, in a manner approved by the
                  State Agency.

         16.1.3   Investments made in conjunction with the utilisation of both
                  Associated Natural Gas and Excess Associated Natural Gas,
                  together with investments incurred after approval of a
                  Development Plan in carrying out feasibility studies on the
                  utilisation of Excess Associated Natural Gas, shall be Costs
                  and Expenses.

16.2     Non-associated Natural Gas

         16.2.1   When any Non-associated Natural Gas is discovered within the
                  Contract Area, the Contractor may present proposals for
                  appraisal and development as follows:

                  After Non-associated Natural Gas has been discovered within
                  the Contract Area, the Contractor shall present to the
                  Co-ordination Committee, a report, including, without
                  limitation, an initial estimate of the boundaries of the
                  Non-associated Natural Gas Reservoir and a range of
                  recoverable reserves.

                  The Contractor shall be required to decide whether to submit
                  an Appraisal Programme as soon as is practical in all the
                  circumstances but not later than thirty-six (36) Months from
                  the date of the submission of the

                                       63
<PAGE>

                  discovery report.

                  If the Contractor commits to an approved Appraisal Programme
                  for the Non-associated Natural Gas Reservoir, delineation and
                  review of the potential of the Non-associated Natural Gas
                  Reservoir will continue for a period not longer than three (3)
                  Years from the Approval of the Appraisal Programme. During the
                  review period and the period of the Appraisal Programme, the
                  Contractor shall maintain all rights and interests in the
                  relevant portion of the Contract Area.

                  The expenses incurred by the Contractor in carrying out the
                  said review, evaluation and Appraisal Programme shall be Costs
                  and Expenses.

         16.2.2   Following the completion and review of the Appraisal
                  Programme, the Contractor shall submit an appraisal report to
                  the Co-ordination Committee and may submit a Development Plan
                  for approval in accordance with Article 9.5. Georgian Oil and
                  the Contractor shall also endeavour to finalise Gas Sales
                  Contract(s) and other agreements necessary for the commercial
                  exploitation of such Non-associated Natural Gas.

         16.2.3   Unless otherwise agreed between the Contractor and Georgian
                  Oil, all Non-associated Natural Gas (and excess Associated
                  Natural Gas) produced from the Contract Area under a
                  Development Plan which has been approved, or deemed to have
                  been approved, by the Co-ordination Committee shall be sold by
                  the Contractor on its own behalf and as agent for Georgian Oil
                  on a joint dedicated basis on terms common to both Parties.
                  Every such agreement shall require the express approval of
                  Georgian Oil which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
                  Georgian Oil may engage independent experts, as proper and
                  reasonable, to make the necessary examination of any such
                  agreement the costs of which shall be reimbursed to Georgian
                  Oil by the Contractor and shall constitute Costs and Expenses.

         16.2.4   Where Non-associated Natural Gas (or excess Associated Natural
                  Gas) is sold by the Contractor on a joint dedicated basis
                  pursuant to Article 16.2.3, the provisions of Article 11,
                  relating to the allocation of Petroleum for recovery of costs
                  and production sharing, shall apply to the distribution of the
                  proceeds from the sale of Non-associated Natural Gas with
                  effect that Georgian Oil and the Contractor shall have title
                  in undivided shares to the Non-associated Natural Gas
                  available for sale on a joint dedicated basis and will hold
                  those shares in undivided proportions equal to the proportions
                  in which during that period they were entitled to share
                  available Petroleum. Accordingly the net proceeds from the
                  sale on a joint dedicated basis of Non-associated Natural Gas
                  in any given period shall be divided between Georgian Oil and
                  the Contractor in the proportions in which they had title to
                  the Non-associated Natural Gas sold.

         16.2.5   The production period for any Non-associated Natural Gas
                  within the Contract Area shall be a period equal to the
                  greater of the term of the Gas Sales Contract(s) or other
                  commercial Natural Gas agreement for such Non-associated
                  Natural Gas and twenty-five (25) consecutive Years beginning
                  on the date of commencement of Commercial Production of such
                  Non-associated Natural Gas. Such period shall not exceed the
                  maximum term of the Contract, plus any extensions permitted
                  under Article 4,2. Georgian Oil and the Contractor shall
                  endeavour to conclude Gas Sales Contract(s) and implement a
                  Development Plan for Non-associated Natural Gas so as to
                  deplete each Reservoir within its production period and within
                  the term of this Contract, subject always to the application
                  of Good Oilfield Practices.

         16.2.6   In the event that the development of Non-associated Natural
                  Gas appears to be uneconomic under the provisions of this
                  Contract, the Parties shall meet to discuss amending the terms
                  of this Contract. In the event the

                                       65
<PAGE>

                  Parties are unable to agree upon modifications to make
                  development, production, and marketing of a Non-associated
                  Natural Gas discovery economic to the Contractor, the State
                  and Georgian Oil agree that they will not enter into any
                  arrangements for the development of such Non-associated
                  Natural Gas discovery with any Third Parties under less
                  favourable terms to the State and Georgian Oil than the
                  Contractor's last offer under the negotiations above, without
                  first offering such development and terms to the Contractor.
                  State and Georgian Oil shall notify Contractor in writing
                  within thirty (30) days of receipt of any such offer, giving
                  the full details of such offer. Contractor shall have one
                  hundred eighty (180) days following its receipt of notice of
                  the Third Party offer to match the offer. This right of first
                  refusal shall run concurrent with the term of this Contract
                  and shall survive the expiration or termination of this
                  Contract for a period of five (5) years. If the Third Party
                  offer to the State and Georgian Oil is on more favourable
                  commercial terms to the State and Georgian Oil than
                  Contractor's last offer, the above limitation on the State and
                  Georgian Oil shall not apply.

16.3     The Contractor may participate in the installation and operation of the
         pipeline(s) required to transport Non-associated Natural Gas produced
         from the Contract Area to the market for such Non-associated Natural
         Gas and share with Georgian Oil in any revenues, in the proportion in
         which Article 11 they were entitled to share available Petroleum,
         generated from the use of said pipeline(s) by others. If the Contractor
         participates in the installation and operation of such pipeline(s), the
         installation and operation of such pipeline(s) shall be included in
         Development Plan and Petroleum Operations under this Contract.

16.4     If the State-owned company or other entity, or Georgian Oil provides
         Natural Gas

                                       66
<PAGE>

         transportation services to the Contractor, then the tariffs charged to
         the Contractor for such services shall be non-discriminatory,
         reasonably based on the investment necessary to provide the
         transportation services and in no event will exceed the rates then
         available to other Third Parties for comparable services based on
         comparable usage and comparable agreement terms. The State through such
         State owned company and Georgian Oil, as the case may be, will ensure
         that such transportation services will be provided in a time frame that
         will not delay field development, all as may be set forth in an
         agreement providing for such services.

16.5     The Co-ordination Committee may appoint a Marketing Team to investigate
         the market conditions and opportunities for the sale of Natural Gas and
         the costs of the Marketing Team will be Costs and Expenses. The Parties
         agree to use their best efforts working with Contractor to secure
         markets and, if necessary, improved Natural Gas terms which may
         include, among other things with respect to Natural Gas:

         the local Georgian market needs and demands;

         the Parties shall have the right to submit potential customers for
         Natural Gas sales;

         the local Georgian market shall have priority if the commercial terms
         available in that market are at least equivalent to commercial terms
         available to Contractor in other markets;

         provisions for a holiday or exemption from Profits Tax and Mineral
         Usage Tax;

         Cost Recovery out of up to 100% of production; and

         a reduced share of the Profit Natural Gas for the Parties representing
         the State.

17.7     Assumption, payment and discharge of taxes shall take place as follows:

         The State shall ensure that Georgian Oil (or its successors or
         assignees) shall assume, pay and discharge when due, in the name and on
         behalf of Contractor, Profit Tax liability and Mineral Usage Tax
         liability for each Calendar Year calculated in accordance with this
         Article 17 out of Georgian Oil's share of Profit Oil and Profit Natural
         Gas for each Calendar Year. For the avoidance of ambiguity, this
         obligation of Georgian Oil as related to the Mineral Usage Tax and
         Profit Tax under this Article 17.7 shall also extend to the Operating
         Company if, under the laws of Georgia, under the License it is deemed
         liable instead of the Contractor Parties for the payment of Profit Tax
         or Mineral Usage Tax. Also for the avoidance of ambiguity, Georgian Oil
         shall have the obligation to obtain any necessary consents or approvals
         from the Tax Inspectorate in relation to the provisions of this Article
         17.7 within one (1) month from the date of signing this Contract, as
         more fully described in Article 32.2.

         Contractor's entire Profit Tax and Mineral Usage Tax liability in
         accordance with the provisions of this Article 17.7 shall fulfil the
         entire Profit Tax and Mineral Usage Tax liability of Contractor and of
         Operating Company, if it has any such liability, as set out above.

17.8     The calculation of the taxable base for Contractor for a Calendar Year
         shall be as follows:

         17.8.1   The taxable base for each Contractor Party shall be determined
                  as the total of each such Contractor Party's sales revenues
                  from Cost Recovery Petroleum, Profit Oil and Profit Natural
                  Gas acquired by that Contractor Party pursuant to Article 11
                  of this Contract increased by an amount equal to the
                  Contractor's Profit Tax and Mineral Usage Tax paid on its
                  behalf by Georgian Oil pursuant to Article 17.7 of this
                  Contract and reduced by the amount of Mineral Usage Tax and
                  Deductions.

                                       70

         "Deductions" shall include all costs incurred by each Contractor Party
         during each Calendar Year in connection with Petroleum Operations,
         whether incurred in Georgia or elsewhere and whether paid by the

                  (ii)     the Contractor Party's share of costs and the
                           Contractor Party's own costs incurred during a
                           Calendar Year in respect of Petroleum Operations
                           which are not included in Costs and Expenses
                           determining Cost Recovery Petroleum in Article 11 of

                  this Contract.

17.9     If in calculating the taxable base of Contractor the total sum of
         Deductions exceeds sales revenues from Cost Recovery Petroleum, Profit
         Oil and Profit Natural Gas in any Calendar Year, the resulting loss may
         be carried forward by Contractor to the following Calendar Year and to
         subsequent Calendar Years, one at a time in chronological order, and
         shall be deductible in full and without restriction in computing
         Contractor's taxable base in such Calendar Year(s) until such time as

         income tax paid by Contractor or by reference to the base used to
         compute the amount of such income tax. However, Georgian Oil may deduct
         the payments of Contractor Parties' Profit Tax or Mineral Usage Tax for

         Expenses for the purposes of determining Cost Recovery Petroleum in
         accordance with Article 11, however any penalties, interest, fines or

         Inspectorate in a timely fashion and by the dates herein provided.

17.17    The filing of the Profit Tax and Mineral Usage Tax returns and the
         payment of Profit Tax and Mineral Usage Tax for a Calendar Year will be
         considered the final settlement of all Profit Tax and Mineral Usage Tax
         liabilities for a Contractor for that Calendar Year upon the date six
         years from the end of the Calendar Year for which the return was filed.

17.18    The State will notify Contractor within one (1) Month of the Effective

         but not limited to, all payments received from export sales of

         Exchange into local or other currency, except to the extent such
         conversion is non-discriminatory and required because of a national

         Georgia, at the most favourable exchange rate legally available to
         private commercial parties and in any event at an exchange rate which
         shall be no less beneficial than that granted to other foreign
         investors by the National Bank of Georgia, if the National Bank of
         Georgia engages in currency exchanges for private parties, without the
         payment of any Taxes.

19.8     The Contractor and its Affiliates and Foreign Subcontractors shall have
         the right to pay outside Georgia principal and interest on loans used

         value of such items, if they are sold in Georgia to a person who would
         not be exempt from the payment of Customs Duties, VAT or other such

         under this Contract.

         Access to such export points shall be provided to the above parties on
         terms, including access and tariffs, no less favourable as is then
         generally available to private commercial Third Parties, namely
         non-State owned or controlled entities for comparable usage.

21.2     Title to Petroleum produced under this Contract shall pass to Georgian
         Oil and the Contractor at the Measurement Point unless otherwise agreed
         in a lifting agreement.

21.3     The Contractor and Georgian Oil shall each be entitled to designate (at

         shall check the liftings of Petroleum from the Measurement Point.

21.4     Before the Commencement of Commercial Production Georgian Oil and the
         Contractor will enter into a lifting agreement on appropriate terms.
         Such lifting agreement shall provide that if one of the Parties is
         unable to lift its share of Petroleum in due time, with the result that
         Petroleum Operations shall be interfered with or disrupted, then after
         the giving of such notice as is practical under the circumstances, any
         other Party may dispose of it, and thereafter at its option give back
         to such non-lifting Party an equivalent amount of Petroleum or the
         actual net proceeds from such disposal, after taking into account any
         necessary costs reasonably incurred. Such lifting agreement shall also
         provide that Contractor Parties and Georgian Oil (and any purchaser
         from any such Party, and their respective carriers) shall have access
         to the lifting point for lifting their shares of Petroleum subject to
         laws, regulations and safety, capacity, environmental, scheduling and

         behalf of the Contractor in connection with Petroleum Operations, shall
         vest in the State, without consideration, on the day the original cost
         thereof has been recovered by the Contractor as Costs and Expenses from

         enjoy continued free, exclusive and unrestricted use of all assets
         acquired by or on behalf of the Contractor in connection with Petroleum
         Operations at no cost or loss of benefit to the Contractor until the

         moveable assets located in the relinquished Contract Area may be
         transferred to any part of the remaining Contract Area for conducting

         Contract Area shall vest in the State. When the Contract comes to an
         end, all moveable assets whose cost has not been recovered by the
         Contractor as Costs and Expenses from Cost Recovery Petroleum remain
         the property of the Contractor, subject to any adjustment necessary to

         24.3.5   In the event that Contractor fails or refuses to submit a plan
                  under this Article 24, or fails to implement and complete
                  clean-up and remediation, the State Agency may take all steps
                  to develop and implement a clean-up and remediation plan.

         promptly notify the State Agency of, all emergency and other events
         (including explosions, leaks and spills), occurring in relation to the
         Petroleum Operations which are causing or likely to cause material
         environmental damage or material risk to health and safety. Such notice
         shall include a summary description of the circumstances and steps
         taken and planned by the Contractor to control and remedy the
         situation. The Contractor shall provide such additional reports to the
         State Agency as are necessary in respect of the effects of such events
         and the course of all actions taken to prevent further loss and to
         mitigate deleterious effects.

24.6     In the event of emergency situations as set forth in 24.5, above, at
         the request of the Contractor, the State, without prejudice and in
         addition to any indemnification obligations the State may have
         hereunder, shall assist the Contractor, to the extent possible, in any
         emergency response, remedial or repair effort by making available any
         labour, materials and equipment in reasonable quantities requested by
         the Contractor which are not otherwise readily available to the
         Contractor and by facilitating the measures taken by Contractor to
         bring into Georgia personnel, materials and equipment to be used in any
         such emergency response or remedial or repair effort. Contractor shall
         reimburse the State's reasonable and necessary costs incurred in such
         efforts, which reimbursed amounts shall be considered Costs and
         Expenses.

24.7     The Contractor shall not be liable to the State, Georgian Oil or Third
         Parties for any damages caused by contamination entering the Contract
         Area as a result of State, Georgian Oil or Third Party activities
         beyond or within the boundaries of the Contract Area. The State shall
         be legally and financially responsible for any loss, damage and
         liability, including remediation of environmental conditions which may
         be required for safe conduct of the Petroleum Operations, caused by the
         State's or Georgian Oil's activities beyond or within the Contract
         Area.

24.8     The Contractor shall not be liable for any loss or damage, including
         but not limited to spillage, explosion, contamination or similar
         environmental damage, in respect of any storage facilities, pipelines
         or means of transportation which are not under the direct possession
         and control of the Contractor or its Affiliates or its Subcontractors
         or the Operating Company. In addition to the foregoing, the Contractor
         shall not be liable for any damage whatsoever in respect of the State
         share of Petroleum, storage or transportation thereof once Georgian Oil
         has taken custody of the State share of Petroleum.

24.9     The State shall make best efforts to ensure the safety and security of
         the Contractor's property and personnel in Georgia and to protect them
         from loss, injury and damage resulting from war (declared or
         undeclared), civil conflict, sabotage, blockade, riot, terrorism,
         unlawful commercial extortion, or organised crime. Notwithstanding
         anything to the contrary contained herein, Contractor acknowledges and
         agrees that the obligations undertaken by the State in this Article
         24.9 are no greater than the general obligations of the State towards
         citizens of Georgia in respect to the perils named above. Furthermore,
         Contractor agrees that it shall have no claim for legal or equitable
         relief for failure of the State to comply with the provisions of
         Article 24.9, except as may be permitted by law.

24.10    Except as set forth in Article 29 hereof, it is understood and agreed
         that the State shall not seek or declare any cancellation or
         termination of this Contract and/or the License as a result of the
         occurrence of any emergency event described in this Article 24.

                                  FORCE MAJEURE

25.1     If as a result of Force Majeure, any Party, including the Contractor is
         rendered unable, wholly or in part, to carry out its obligations under
         this Contract, other than the obligation to pay any amounts of money
         due, then the obligations of such Party so far as and to the extent
         that the obligations are affected by such Force Majeure, shall be
         suspended during the continuance of any inability so caused, but for no
         longer period.

         Such Party shall notify all other Parties of the Force Majeure
         situation within (14) Days of becoming aware of the circumstances
         relied upon and shall keep all other Parties informed of all
         significant developments. Such notice shall give reasonably full
         particulars of the said Force Majeure, and also estimate the period of
         time which such Party will probably require to remedy the Force
         Majeure. Failure to give any such notification in a timely fashion
         shall mean that the period of Force Majeure shall be deemed to have
         commenced on the date of the giving of such notice.

         The affected Party shall use all reasonable diligence to remove or
         overcome or avoid the Force Majeure situation as quickly as possible in
         an economic manner. The period of any such non-performance or delay,
         together with such period as may be necessary for the restoration of
         any damage done during such delay, shall be added to the time given in
         this Contract for the performance of any obligation dependent thereon
         and the continuation of any right granted; provided, however, the term
         of this Contract shall be not be extended as a result of

         (i)      any particular event of Force Majeure, if the duration of any
                  such particular event of Force Majeure which, together with
                  any period of time required for restoration, is for a period
                  of 30 Days or less; and

         (ii)     the enactment or adoption of a law, rule or regulation by the
                  State or any local or legislative body of or within Georgia,
                  whether acting directly or through Georgian Oil, if such law,
                  rule or regulation is comparable to one which has

                                       98
<PAGE>

                  been enacted or adopted, on or before the date the Contract is
                  signed, by a member nation of the European Union or any
                  legislative or regulatory body of the European Union.
                  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained, no
                  event shall constitute Force Majeure if it does not delay or
                  prevent the Contractor from engaging in the conduct of
                  Petroleum Operations.

         For the purposes of this Contract, "Force Majeure" shall mean natural
         calamities, strikes, sabotage and other production disorders, civil
         disturbance, war (declared or undeclared), or other military actions,
         terrorist or guerrilla activity, blockade, revolt, earthquake,
         avalanche, orders, laws or decrees of any state or governmental entity
         of any country, or other similar events beyond the control of the Party
         claiming Force Majeure which could not have been prevented by it. [No
         change]

25.2     The exercise by Georgian Oil or by State Agency of any right under this
         Contract shall not constitute Force Majeure under any circumstance

25.3     It is recognised that a Force Majeure event may pertain only to part of
         the Contract Area. In the event part of the License is in Force Majeure
         when a Work Programme or a relinquishment become due, then the Work
         Programme and/or relinquishment required shall be reduced in size by a
         ratio proportionate to the area in Force Majeure divided by the full
         size of the then current Contract Area.

         Likewise, the time period for a Work Programme and/or relinquishment
         for any area under Force Majeure shall be suspended for the time it is
         under Force Majeure.

                           ASSIGNMENTS AND GUARANTEES

26.1     No assignment, mortgage or charge or other encumbrance or transfer (for
         the purposes of this Article 26, all of the foregoing an "assignment"
         and correlatives thereof) shall be made by the Contractor of its rights
         obligations or interests arising under this Contract other than in
         accordance with the provisions of this Article 26.

26.2     Except in case of an assignment made pursuant to the provisions of
         Articles 26.4 and 26.5, the provisions of this Section 26.2 shall first
         apply. Any Party, (which shall include Georgian Oil, or any other
         successor entity owned by the State, from and after its exercise of its
         rights under this Section pursuant to which it shall have become a
         Contractor by acquiring the rights of a Contractor or otherwise shall
         become a Contractor), wishing to assign all or part of its rights and
         interests hereunder or in any circumstances where there is deemed to be
         an assignment shall first give written notice to the other Parties
         specifying the proposed terms and conditions of the assignment.
         Following receipt of those terms and conditions, for a period of thirty
         (30) Days, each Party shall have the preferential right to match the
         terms and conditions of the proposed assignment or deemed assignment.
         This right may be exercised by any Party giving written notice within
         said period of its intention to match the relevant terms and conditions
         (the "Acceptance") and thereafter the relevant Parties shall negotiate
         all necessary documentation. If, within a further period of sixty (60)
         Days from the receipt of the Acceptance, the relevant Parties have not
         reached substantially final agreement, the Party seeking to assign may
         within a further period of thirty (30) Days complete an assignment to a
         Third Party on the same terms and conditions. In amplification of the
         foregoing sentence and for the avoidance of any doubt, any assignment
         to a Third Party shall be subject to the assigning Party and the Third
         Party complying with the provisions of this Article 26.

26.3     Contractor may assign all or part of its rights, obligations and
         interests arising from this Contract, and the Parent Company may,
         whether directly or indirectly, assign Control of a Contractor Party,
         to a Third Party or another Contractor provided that

                                      100
<PAGE>

         any such assignee:

         26.3.1   has the technical and financial ability to perform the
                  obligations to be assumed by it under the Contract; provided,
                  however, that the technical or financial ability or experience
                  of a prospective assignee shall not be assumed merely because
                  such assignee has the financial ability or technical ability
                  or experience of the assigning Contractor Party or its Parent
                  Company, whether singly or collectively, or has already become
                  another Contractor Party;

         26.3.2   accepts and assumes all of the terms and conditions of the
                  Contract, including providing a Parent Company Guarantee;

         26.3.3   is an entity with which the State, Georgian Oil and the
                  Contractor can legally do business.

         Any such assignment shall be subject to the prior written consent of
         the State Agency which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
         delayed. Georgian Oil shall be deemed to have approved any assignment
         to which the State Agency has consented.

         By way of clarification and not in limitation of the foregoing
         provisions of this Article, the State shall not be considered to be
         acting unreasonably in declining to consent to any such assignment if
         the assignment to such proposed assignee is deemed contrary to State
         interests, as evidenced by a writing to that effect signed by the
         President, the State Minister or State Chancellor/Secretary, or the
         Minister of Foreign Affairs or Defence or there is an act of Parliament
         to that effect.

         If within thirty (30) Days following notification of an intended
         assignment, accompanied by a copy of the proposed deed of assignment
         and related documentation with respect to the proposed assignee,
         including certified financial statements and other evidence to the
         State's reasonable satisfaction of the matters set forth in Article
         26.3.1 and such documentation, which shall include evidence of

                                      101
<PAGE>

         the identity of owners of the assignee, provided in the case of a
         company the stock of which is registered on a recognised stock
         exchange, a copy of the documents identifying the significant owners,
         as such concept is defined or used in the applicable laws pursuant to
         which such company registered its stock, will satisfy the foregoing
         requirements, and its direct and indirect parent companies, including
         the identity of the owners of the ultimate parent, subject to the
         foregoing proviso, as may be reasonably necessary for the State, and as
         requested by the State, to make a determination of the State interests
         as described above, the State has not given its written decision
         concerning such assignment, then it shall be deemed that the State has
         declined to give such consent; provided that thereafter if upon the
         further written request of the Contractor for a written decision, the
         State has not given a written response of any kind within fifteen (15)
         Days after such further request, then the assignment shall be deemed
         approved and the State shall execute an assignment, in the form
         contemplated in Article 26.8 accepting such assignment. This second
         request from the Contractor shall cite the provisions of this paragraph
         and the Contractor shall obtain confirmation from the State that the
         request has been received.

26.4     Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 26.3, Contractor may assign
         all or part of its rights, obligations and interests arising from this
         Contract to an Affiliate without the prior consent of the State or
         Georgian Oil, provided that any such Affiliate:

         26.4.1   has the technical and financial ability and experience to
                  perform the obligations to be assumed by it under the
                  Contract; and

         26.4.2   accepts and assumes all of the terms and conditions of the
                  Contract as if the Affiliate had originally been a signatory
                  to this Contract.

                                      102
<PAGE>

         In the event of such an assignment, the Parent Company shall provide an
         undertaking to the State guaranteeing that it holds ultimate control of
         its Affiliate and ultimate responsibility for the rights and
         responsibilities of the Affiliate.

         If such Affiliate shall be less that 100%, directly and indirectly
         owned by the Parent Company, then the consent of the State shall be
         required, but may not be withheld unless the Parent Company does not
         have voting control over all decisions of the proposed assignee,
         whether such decisions are exercised as stockholder or indirectly
         through the board of directors or other governing body of such
         assignee, provided, however, the election or appointment of a resident
         or citizen of the nation or territory, where an entity is incorporated,
         as a member of the board of directors or other governing body of such
         entity or the ownership of a nominal equity interest in such entity by
         any such person to satisfy the mandatory requirements of any applicable
         law of such nation or territory shall not be deemed to negate the
         satisfaction of the foregoing. The Contractor shall provide the State
         with such evidence that the State may reasonably request to satisfy the
         State that it does not have the right to decline to give its consent
         based on the provisions of the foregoing provision.

         If the Parent Company wishes to assign its direct or indirect Control
         of a Contractor Party to an Affiliate which is 100% directly or
         indirectly owned by the Parent Company, then the consent of the State
         shall not be required.

26.5     Provided that Contractor has obtained the prior consent of the State
         (not to be unreasonably withheld) as contemplated in Article 26.3,
         Contractor and its assignees shall not be restricted in any way and
         shall not be required to obtain any

                                      103
<PAGE>

         additional consent for any pledge or assignment of their respective
         interests in this Contract or any Petroleum Operations undertaken
         pursuant hereto to any bank, lender or other person providing financing
         in connection with this Contract or such Petroleum Operations and if
         such bank, lender or other person shall foreclose upon such interest
         pledged or assigned, such bank, lender or person shall become entitled
         to the rights, and subject to the obligations of an assignee hereunder.

26.6     Georgian Oil may assign its rights, obligations and interests arising
         from this Contract (including, but not limited to, all or part of its
         right to lift a share of Profit Oil); provided, however,
         notwithstanding the provisions of Article 26, the obligations of
         Georgian Oil under this Contract may, and may only, be assigned to
         another majority owned State entity.The provisions of this Article 26.6
         shall not apply to the assignment of any rights that Georgian Oil may
         hold as a Contractor Party.

26.7     No Taxes, fees or other charges shall be payable to the State or to
         Georgian Oil as a consequence of any assignment; provided, however,
         appropriate Administrative Fees, including the reasonable and proper
         fees of any independent advisors, may be charged, including for a
         review of the appropriate documents and payment for re-registration of
         the license.

26.8     Every assignment under this Article shall be evidenced by an
         assignment, incorporating all the terms hereinabove provided in this
         Article 26, including those contemplated in Article 26.7, and shall be
         executed by all of the State, Georgian Oil, the assignor and assignee
         and all other appropriate Parties, which assignment shall include
         provisions whereby the assignee, accept and assume all of the terms and
         conditions of this Contract. In addition, a Parent Company Guarantee
         shall also be provided by the applicable Parent Company. Such
         assignment instrument and Parent Company Guarantee shall be subject to
         the reasonable satisfaction of the State.

26.9     In this Article 26, "Control" shall mean the ownership or control of
         such interests in an entity as to enable a person or persons acting
         together to exercise, directly or through another entity or entities,
         management control or establish management

                                      104
<PAGE>

         policy. Equity ownership of a majority of the outstanding ownership
         interests in any entity shall be deemed to constitute Control. In
         clarification of the foregoing, a change in the membership of the board
         of directors does not in and of itself constitute a change or loss of
         Control.

26.10    Licence

26.10.1  The Licence shall continue to be held by the re-registered Operating
         Company, and the State Agency shall issue a supplementary amendment to
         the Licence, including therein a reference to this Contract and
         confirming the Contractor's rights and obligations under this Contract.
         The State Agency shall issue the supplementary amendment not more than
         thirty days after the execution hereof.

26.10.2  Contractor agrees to be responsible for the fulfilment of all
         obligations of the Licence by the Operating Company or otherwise and
         for all liabilities arising from any breach of the Licence.

26.10.3  The Operating Company may assign the Licence only with the prior
         written consent of the Contractor, Georgian Oil, and the State Agency.

   CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT AND STABILISATION, AND REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

27.1     In the course of performing the Petroleum Operations, the Contractor
         shall be subject to all applicable laws, decrees, rules and regulations
         of Georgia.

27.2     The Parties agree to cooperate in every possible way in order to
         achieve the objectives of this Contract. Subject to applicable laws,
         decrees, rules and regulations, the State shall facilitate the exercise
         of the Contractor's activities by granting it all necessary permits,
         licenses and access rights as in this Contract set forth so that the
         Parties may derive the greatest benefit from Petroleum Operations for
         their own benefit and for the benefit of Georgia.

27.3     If at any time after this Amended Production Sharing Contract is
         signed, there is a change in the applicable laws of Georgia which:

         27.3.1   materially affects the Contractor's or the Operating Company's
                  conduct of Petroleum Operations in Georgia under this
                  Contract; or

         27.3.2   imposes on the Contractor or the Operating Company any Taxes
                  which would not have been applicable to the Contractor or the
                  Operating Company when this Contract was signed or increases
                  the rates of any Taxes that applied when this Contract was
                  signed; or

         27.3.3   places an undue material economic burden on the Contractor
                  which was not present when the Contract was signed;

         Then the State undertakes that:

         27.3.4   in the case of a change falling under Article 27.3.1 the
                  Contractor and the Operating Company will, in respect of any
                  matter for which express

<PAGE>

                  provision is made in this Contract, be deemed to be in full
                  compliance with the law as amended from time to time, if the
                  Petroleum Operations carried out by the Contractor or the

                  Company, to the same overall economic position which it, or
                  they, would have enjoyed if the change in the applicable law
                  had not been made. If the proposal made by the State and

                  receipt of notice of the breach;

         29.2.2   the Contractor is in breach of Article 8 of this Contract and

         29.2.8   Failure to develop known and prospective Petroleum reservoirs
                  diligently as a reasonable and prudent operator would develop

         29.2.9   Failure or refusal to timely complete the clean up and
                  remediation programme established pursuant to Article 24.3.

         the Parent Company, and in respect of any such entity (here in this
         Article 29 a "Defaulting Participant") an event occurs of the kind
         described in Articles 29.2.2, 29.2.3, 29.2.4 or 29.2.5 or any such
         entity (also herein referred to as a "Defaulting Participant") is in
         material breach of an obligation which as provided in the Contract is a
         several obligation, the State and Georgian Oil will not be entitled to
         terminate the Contract unless all the entities who constitute the

         Participants a notice (hereinafter a "Default Assignment Notice").

         shares in the Contract and each of the Non-Defaulting Participants
         shall be obliged to accept that assignment, including all the
         obligations arising after the date thereof. In amplification and
         clarification of the foregoing, a Non-Defaulting Participant accepting

         29.5.1   the State gives not less that thirty (30) Days written notice
                  ("Notice") to the Contractor or, as the case may be, the
                  Defaulting Participant, of an intention to terminate the
                  Contract or to serve a Default Assignment Notice, stating in
                  detail in the Notice the alleged material breach or other
                  grounds for termination or service of a Default Assignment
                  Notice relied upon by the State;

         29.5.2   the Contractor or the Defaulting Participant is given a period
                  of ninety (90) Days from receipt of the Notice to cure or
                  remove such material breach or other grounds specified in the
                  Notice for termination or service of a Default Assignment
                  Notice; and

         29.5.3   the Contractor or the Defaulting Participant has failed within
                  such ninety (90) Days to cure or remove such material breach.

29.6     It is acknowledged that the Contractor or the Defaulting Participant
         may invoke its arbitration rights under Article 30 and thereby dispute
         any such termination. If the Contractor or any Defaulting Participant
         submits any matter to arbitration, then such submission shall not
         suspend the effectiveness of a termination under Articles 29.2.1,
         29.2.2 and 29.7. Further if there should be any violation of any law,
         rule or regulation, the applicable provisions thereof shall govern with
         respect to the

                                      117
<PAGE>

         consequences of any such violation.

29.7     Notwithstanding anything in this Contract to the contrary, if a Parent
         Company fails to comply with its obligations under Article 26 and
         further fails to reasonably and in good faith commence acting to
         correct such failure within thirty (30) Days of notification thereof;
         then such failure to comply shall constitute a material breach with the
         result that this Contract shall terminate immediately with respect to
         the Affiliate of the defaulting Parent Company which is a Contractor
         Party.

29.8     The Licence shall terminate, ipso facto, upon the termination or
         expiration of this Contract. In the event that this Contract terminates
         with respect to fewer than all of the Parties, all rights of such
         Parties under the Licence shall terminate, ipso facto, concurrently
         with such partial termination.

                               DISPUTE RESOLUTION

30.1     Save in the case of disagreements falling within Article 30.5, for the
         purpose of this Article, there are two parties that is to say the State
         and Georgian Oil who shall so long as Georgian Oil is designated as the
         National Oil Company together constitute the First Dispute Party and
         the Contractor who shall constitute the Second Dispute Party, and
         references in this Article to the Dispute Parties shall be construed
         accordingly. In the event that Georgian Oil ceases to be designated as
         the National Oil Company, the Parties will reasonably and in good faith
         review this Article 30.1.

30.2     The Parties hereby consent to submit to the International Centre for
         Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) any Dispute in relation to or
         arising out of this Contract for settlement by arbitration pursuant to
         the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States
         and Nationals of Other States (the "Convention"). It is acknowledged
         that the State has signed and deposited its instrument of ratification
         of the Convention on the 7th of August 1992 and the Dispute Parties may
         rely on the Convention having entered into force in the Republic of
         Georgia without qualification on the 6th September 1992.

30.3     The Dispute Parties agree that, for the purposes of Article 25(1) of
         the Convention, any Dispute is a legal dispute arising directly out of
         an investment.

30.4     For the purposes of Article 25(2) of the Convention, it is agreed that
         NPL is a national of Bermuda and any wholly owned subsidiaries shall be
         treated as nationals of the latter state for the purposes of the
         Convention.

30.5     In the event that a dispute arises among the private Parties to this
         Contract and neither the State nor Georgian Oil is a Dispute Party, the
         private Parties, unless otherwise agreed among the private Parties to
         the Contract, hereby submit to arbitration in London, United Kingdom in
         accordance with the arbitration rules of the London Court of
         International Arbitration. Judgement upon any arbitral award

30.7     Any arbitration tribunal constituted pursuant to this Contract shall
         apply the provisions of this Contract as governed and construed
         according to the law of Georgia and such rules of international law as
         may be applicable.

30.8     Contractor, the State and Georgian Oil (with reference to any matter
         pertaining to Georgian Oil's role as a State Representative) hereby
         consent to submit to ICSID any disagreement arising out of the
         Contract, including, without limitation, whether the State and Georgian
         Oil have served a valid Default Assignment Notice. The provisions of
         Articles 30.2, 30.3, 30.4, 30.7 and 30.8 shall apply to the arbitration
         of such disagreement. In the event that Contractor is organised in a
         state which is not a party to the Convention, any disagreement shall be
         submitted for settlement by arbitration under the Additional Facility
         Rules of ICSID.

30.9     Either the First Dispute Party or the Second Dispute Party may commence
         a Sole Expert determination with respect to any matter in dispute
         between such Dispute Parties which may be or is required to be referred
         to a Sole Expert under the provisions of the Contract (or with respect
         to any other matter which the First Dispute Party and the Second
         Dispute Party may otherwise agree to so refer) by giving written notice
         to such effect. Such notice shall contain a statement describing the
         issue and all relevant information associated therewith. A Sole Expert
         shall be an independent and impartial person of international standing
         with relevant qualifications and experience appointed pursuant to the

         Party. The Sole Expert shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator
         or mediator and, unless otherwise agreed, shall be instructed to
         resolve the dispute referred to him within thirty (30) Days of his
         appointment. Upon the selection of the Sole Expert, the Dispute Party
         receiving the notice of referral above shall submit its own statement
         containing all information it considers relevant with respect to the
         matter in dispute. The decision of the Sole

                                      120

<PAGE>

         First Dispute Party and the Second Dispute Party are unable to agree on
         the appointment of a Sole Expert within twenty (20) Days after a
         Dispute Party has received a notice of referral under this Clause 30.10
         the Sole Expert shall be selected by the Secretary General of ICSID and
         the person so selected shall be deemed to have been appointed by the
         Dispute Parties.

30.10    The fees and expenses of the Sole Expert appointed under the provisions
         of Article 30.9 or other provision of this Contract shall be borne by
         the losing Dispute Party and shall not be considered Costs and
         Expenses.

30.11    It is further agreed by the Parties, that no registered presence that
         the Contractor may establish or may be required to establish in
         Georgia, including but not limited to the formation of an Operating
         Company, registration of an NPL representative office, registration
         with the tax authorities or creation of a permanent establishment for
         tax purposes, shall constitute a Georgian legal entity for the purposes
         of Article 30.2 of the Petroleum Law. To amplify the foregoing, the
         State and Georgian Oil hereby irrevocably and unconditionally confirm
         that the arbitration agreement set forth in Article 5 of the Original
         Contract, as amended hereunder is valid, effective and binding on the
         State and Georgian Oil.

SECTION I
GENERAL PROVISIONS

1.1.     PURPOSE

         The accounting procedures included in this Accounting Procedure
         establish a framework of accounting principles as generally accepted
         within the international Petroleum industry. The purpose of this
         Accounting Procedure is to establish a fair and equitable method for
         accounting for Petroleum Operations under the Contract, to classify
         expenditures, define Costs and Expenses and prescribe the manner in
         which the Contractor's accounts shall be prepared and approved.

1.2.     DEFINITIONS

         For the purpose of this Accounting Procedure the following terms shall
         have the following meanings:

         "Accepted Accounting Procedure" shall mean accounting principles,
         practices and procedures generally accepted and recognised in the
         international Petroleum industry.

         "Accounting Procedure" shall mean the accounting principles, practices
         and procedures set forth in this Annex C.

         "Accruals Accounting Basis" shall mean the basis of accounting which
         records the effect of transactions and events on financial conditions
         and income when an obligation is created or a right arises.

         "Contract" shall mean the production sharing contract this Accounting
         Procedure is annexed to.

         "Controllable Material" means all materials and equipment controlled
         and inventoried by the Contractor. A list of types of such Controllable
         Material shall be

                                      128

<PAGE>

         furnished to Georgian Oil upon request.

         "Material and Equipment" means property, including without limitation
         all exploration, appraisal and development facilities together with
         supplies and equipment, acquired and held for use in Petroleum
         Operations.

         The words and phrases defined in the Contract but not defined above
         shall have the same meaning in this Accounting Procedure as is given to
         them in the Contract.

1.3.     AUDITS

         1.3.1    The State or Georgian Oil shall have the right to audit the
                  Contractor's accounts and records maintained under the
                  Contract with respect to each Calendar Year within two Years
                  from the end of each such Year as follows. Should Georgian Oil
                  decide not to perform its own audit, the audit may be
                  conducted by the State Agency. However, the audit may be
                  conducted instead by an independent auditor of international
                  standing familiar with international petroleum industry
                  practice in accordance with international auditing standards
                  at the request of Georgian Oil or the State Agency, but not
                  both. If audit is performed by an independent auditor, the
                  cost of such auditor should be borne by the Contractor and
                  treated as Costs and Expenses. For the avoidance of doubt, it
                  is understood that Contractor shall be subject to no more than
                  one audit in total in a single Calendar Year.

         1.3.2    Any audit exceptions shall be made in writing and notified to
                  the Contractor within ninety (90) Days, following completion
                  of the audit in question, and failure to give such written
                  exception within such time shall be deemed to be an
                  acknowledgement of the correctness of the Contractor's books
                  and accounts.

                                      129

<PAGE>

         1.3.3    For purposes of auditing, the State or Georgian Oil may
                  examine and verify, upon providing at least sixty (60) days
                  advance notice to Contractor and at its sole expense, all
                  charges and credits relating to the Petroleum Operations, such
                  as books of account, accounting entries, material records and
                  inventories, vouchers, payrolls, invoices and any other
                  documents, correspondence and records including electronic
                  records considered necessary by the State or Georgian Oil to
                  audit and verify the charges and credits. Furthermore, the
                  auditors shall have the right in connection with such audit,
                  to visit and inspect at reasonable times, all sites, plants,
                  facilities, warehouses and offices of the Contractor directly
                  or indirectly serving the Petroleum Operations and to question
                  personnel associated with those Operations. Where the State or
                  Georgian Oil requires verification of charges made by an
                  Affiliated Company of the Contractor, the State or Georgian
                  Oil shall have the right to obtain an audit certificate from
                  an internationally recognised firm of public accountants
                  acceptable to both the State or Georgian Oil and the
                  Contractor, which may be the Contractor's statutory auditor.
                  The auditors shall make every reasonable effort to conduct
                  their examination in a manner which will result in a minimum
                  of inconvenience to the Contractor

         1.3.4    The Contractor shall answer any notice of exception under
                  paragraph 1.3.2 within one hundred eighty (180) Days of the
                  receipt of such notice. Where the Contractor has, after the
                  said one hundred eighty (180) Days, failed to answer a notice
                  of exception the exception shall prevail.

         1.3.5    All agreed adjustments resulting from an audit and all
                  adjustments required by prevailing exceptions shall be
                  promptly made in the Contractor's accounts and any
                  consequential adjustments to payments due to the State or
                  Georgian Oil shall be made promptly.

                                      130

<PAGE>

         1.3.6    If the Contractor and the State or Georgian Oil are unable to
                  reach final agreement on proposed audit adjustments they shall
                  refer their dispute for binding and final resolution by an
                  internationally recognised firm of independent public
                  accountants appointed in accordance with the procedures for
                  appointing a Sole Expert pursuant to Article 30 of the
                  Contract. When issues are outstanding with respect to an
                  audit, the Contractor shall maintain the relevant documents
                  and permit inspection thereof until the issue is resolved.

1.4.     THE CONTRACTOR'S BOOKS

         1.4.1    The Contractor shall maintain at the Contractor's office in
                  Georgia in English in local currency and US$ and on an Accrual
                  Accounting Basis books and accounts for Petroleum Operations.
                  Such books and accounts shall be kept in accordance with
                  Accepted Accounting Procedure and the provisions of the
                  Contract and this Accounting Procedure ("Petroleum Operations
                  Account").

6.3      The Meeting of the Partners shall be convened by the Directorate (as
         defined in Article 7) which shall notify the Partners of the meeting
         and the draft agenda not later than 8 days prior to the Meeting. Upon

         disclosure of interest which bind the Partners.

6.5      The Directorate is responsible to convene immediately the Meeting of

         (vi)     representing the Company in legal proceedings against
                  Directors.

6.9      The decisions of the Meeting of the Partners shall be adopted by a
         simple majority vote.

         be held if each Partner which has the right to vote, gives a written
         consent with regard to the issue under consideration. If any Partner is
         against such a procedure, an actual Meeting of the Partners shall be
         held to discuss the matter.

         the Meeting. The representative of NPL shall serve as Chairman of the
         meeting in the first year and the representative of Georgian Oil shall
         serve as Chairman of the meeting in the second year, thereafter
         alternating on an annual basis.

         adopted, minutes shall be recorded, signed by the Chairman of the
         Meeting, and sent to all Partners.

         then when tendered) and delivery shall be deemed to have occurred no
         later than 10 days after dispatch in the case of international courier
         post and at the expiration of 24 hours after dispatch in the case of

4.       RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES

4.1      ARBITRATION If any dispute or claim between Contractor and the
         Operating Company (in this Section 4.1, each a "disputing party")
         arising out of this Agreement or the rights and duties of the
         Contractor and the Operating Company arising out of this Agreement (in
         this Section 4.1, a "claim") has not been resolved by mutual agreement
         on or before the 30th day following the first notice of the subject
         matter of the claim to or from the disputing parties, then any
         disputing party may refer the claim to arbitration under the following
         provisions:

         (i)      To refer a claim to arbitration, a disputing party must
                  provide notice to the other disputing parties stating (a) a
                  general description of the claim and (b) that the claim is
                  being referred to arbitration under this Section 4.1. (the
                  "Notice").

         (ii)     The disputing parties shall endeavour to agree promptly on a
                  panel of three arbitrators. If no agreement is reached within
                  30 days of receipt of the Notice either party may request the
                  panel of three arbitrators be appointed in accordance with the
                  rules of the International Chamber of Commerce.

         (iii)    The arbitration shall be conducted in London or such other
                  place as the disputing parties may agree. The arbitrators
                  shall set the date, the time, and the place of the hearing,
                  which must commence on or before the 30th day following the
                  designation of the third arbitrator. The hearing may be
                  adjourned to later times and dates as the arbitrators
                  determine. The arbitration shall be conducted under the rules
                  of the International Chamber of Commerce not inconsistent with
                  the provisions of this Agreement. The arbitrators shall
                  endeavour to notify any disputing parties not present of any
                  adjournment to other dates or places; however, the proceedings
                  may continue in the absence of any disputing party that has
                  received notice of the date, the time, and the place of the
                  initial session of the hearing. All hearings shall be
                  conducted in English.

         (iv)     The arbitrators shall endeavour to render their decision on or
                  before the 30th day following the last session of the hearing.
                  If the position of one or more disputing parties prevails,
                  then the other disputing party or parties shall pay all fees
                  and expenses of the arbitrators and the prevailing disputing
                  party in the arbitration. Each disputing party against which
                  the decision assesses a

                                      187

<PAGE>

                  monetary obligation shall pay that obligation on or before the
                  30th day following the decision or such other date as the
                  decision may provide.

         (v)      The decisions of the arbitrators are final and binding on all
                  disputing parties and are not subject to appeal. Without
                  limiting the provisions of Section 4.2, the decisions of the
                  arbitrators may be enforced in any court of competent
                  jurisdiction, and the disputing parties authorise any such
                  court to enter judgement on the arbitrators' decisions.

         (vi)     Each Party agrees that arbitration under this Section 4.1 is
                  the exclusive method for resolving any claim and that it will
                  not commence any action or proceeding based on a claim, except
                  to reinforce arbitrators' decisions as provided in section
                  4.1(v) or to compel the other Party to participate in
                  arbitration under this section 4.1.

4.2      JURISDICTION

         (i)      This Section 4.2 does not affect the limitations set forth in
                  Section 4.1 on commencing judicial proceedings, but may be
                  used to enforce arbitrators' decisions, to compel Parties to
                  participate in arbitration, or to compel Parties that have
                  brought judicial proceedings other than in compliance with
                  this Article 4 to dismiss those proceedings.

         (ii)     Any action arising out of this Agreement or the rights and
                  duties of the Parties arising out of this Agreement may be
                  brought, if at all, only in the courts of England and not in
                  any other jurisdiction, court or tribunal.

         (iii)    Each Party submits itself and its property to the personal
                  jurisdiction of the English courts in any such action. In this
                  connection, each Party waives any objection that now or in the
                  future it may have to the venue of any such action

                                      188

                  and any right to assert that the court is inconvenient, and
                  agrees not to raise any such objection or assertion. A copy of
                  this Agreement may serve as evidence of this waiver.
