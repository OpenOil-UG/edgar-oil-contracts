Accounting, 
Methods 
To 
Be 
Used 
To 
Calculate 


Recovery 
of 
Operating 
Costs 


3.1 
Depreciation 
Depreciation 
will 
be 
calculated 
beginning 
the 
Calendar 
Year 
in 
which 
the 
asset 
is 
placed 
into 
service 
with 
a 
full 
Year's 
depreciation 
allowed 
the 
initial 
Calendar 
Year. 
The 
method 
used 
to 
calculate 
each 
Year's 
allowable 
recovery 
of 
Capital 
Costs 
is 
the 
declining 
balance 
depreciation 
method. 
Calculation 
of 
each 
such 
year's 
allowable 
recovery 
of 
Capital 
Costs 
should 
be 
based 
on 
the-individual 
asset's 
Capital 
Cost 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
such 
Year 
multiplied 
by 
the 
depreciation 
actor 
as 
follows, 
for: 
-Group 
1 
= 
50% 


-Group 
2 
= 
25% 
-Group 
3 
= 
10% 


For 
the 
Groups 
of 
capital 
assets

3.4 
Gas 
Costs 
Operating 
Costs 
directly 
associated 
with 
the 
production 
of 
Natural 
Gas 
will 
be 
directly 
chargeable 
against 
Natural 
Gas 
revenues 
in 
determining 
entitlements 
under 
Section 
VI 
clause 
6.2.2. 
Operating 
Costs 
incurred 
for 
production 
of 
both 
Natural 
Gas 
and 
Crude 
Oil 
be 
allocated 
to 
Natural 
Gas 
and 
Crude 
Oil 
based 
on 
the 
relative 
value 
of 
the 
products 
produced 
for 
the 
current 
Year. 
Common 
support 
cost 
will 
be 
allocated 
on 
an 
equitable 
basis 
agreed 
to 
by 
both 
parties. 
If 
after 
commencement 
of 
production 
the 
Natural 
Gas 
revenues 
do 
not 
permit 
full 
recovery, 
of 
Natural 
Gas 
costs, 
as 
outlined 
above, 
then 
the 
excess 
costs 
shall 
be 
recovered 
from 
Crude 
Oil 
revenues. 


Likewise, 
if 
excess 
Crude 
Oil 
costs 
(Crude 
Oil 
costs 
less 
Crude 
Oil 
revenues) 
exists, 
this 
excess 
can 
be 
recovered 
from 
Natural 
Gas 
revenues. 


If 
production 
of 
either 
Natural 
Gas 
or 
Crude 
Oil 
has 
commenced 
while 
the 
other 
has 
not, 
the 
allocable 
production 
costs 
and 
common 
support 
cost 
allocated 
in 
an 
equitable 
manner. 
Propane 
and 
butane 
fractions 
extracted 
from 
Natural 
Gas 
but 
not 
spiked 
in 
Crude 
Oil 
shall 
be 
deemed 
as 
Natural 
Gas 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
accounting. 


3.5 
Inventory 
Accounting 
The 
costs 
of 
non-capital 
items 
purchased 
for 
inventory 
will 
be 
recoverable 
at 
such 
time 
the 
items 
have 
landed 
in 
Indonesia. 
3.6 
Insurance 
and 
Claims 
Operating 
Costs 
shall 
include 
premiums 
paid 
for 
insurance 
normally 
required 
to 
be 
carried 
for 
the 
Petroleum 
Operations 
relating 
to 
CONTRACTOR's 
obligations 
conducted 
under 
the 
Contract, 
together 
with 
all 
expenditures 
incurred 
and 
paid 
in 
settlement 
of 
any 
and 
all 
losses, 
claims, 
damages, 
judgements, 
and 
other 
expenses, 
including 
fees 
relating 
to 
CONTRACTOR's 
obligation 
under 
the 
Contract. 
3.7 
Abandonment 
and 
Site 
Restoration 
Operating 
Costs 
shall 
include 
all 
expenditures 
incurred 
in 
the 
abandonment 
of 
all 
exploratory 
wells 
and 
the 
restoration 
of 
their 
drillsites, 
together 
with 
all 
estimates 
of 
monies 
required 
for 
the 
funding 
of 
any 
abandonment 
and 
site 
restoration 
program 
established 
in 
conjunction 
with 
an 
approved 
plan 
of 
development 
for 
a 
commercial 
discovery. 
Expenditures 
incurred 
in 
the 
abandonment 
of 
exploratory 
wells 
and 
the 
restoration 
of 
their 
drillsites 
shall 
be 
charged 
as 
Operating 
Costs 
in 
accordance 
with 
Article 
II 
of 
this 
Exhibit 
"C". 


Estimates 
of 
monies 
required 
for 
the 
funding 
of 
any 
abandonment 
and 
site 
restoration 
program 
established 
pursuant 
to 
paragraph 
(c) 
of 
clause 
5.2.5 
of 
the 
Contract 
shall 
be 
charted 
as 
Operating 
Costs 
annually 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
accounting 
accruals 
beginning 
in 
the 
Year 
of 
first 
production. 
The 
amount 
charged 
in 
each 
Year 
will 
be 
calculated 
by 
dividing 
the 
total 
estimated 
cost 
of 
abandonment 
and 
site 
restoration 
for 
each 
discovery 
by 
the 
total 
estimated 
number 
of 
years 
in 
the 
economic 
life 
of 
each 
discovery. 
The 
estimates 
of 
monies 
required 
for 
all 
abandonment 
and 
site 
restoration 
activities 
shall 
be 
reviewed 
on 
an 
annual 
basis 
and 
such 
estimates 
shall 
be 
adjusted 
each 
Year 
as 
required.

shall 
transfer 
without 
cost 
its 
undivided

the 
Indonesian 
Participant 
that 
it 
does 
not

it 
were 
to 
disagree 
to 
the 
inclusion 
of 
such 
operation 
in 
the 
Work 
Program 
and 
Budget 
and 
which

If 
Natural 
Gas

encountered 
in 
commercial 
quantities, 
special 
provisions 
shall 
be 
drawn 
up
