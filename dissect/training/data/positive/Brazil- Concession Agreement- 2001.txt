Exploration 
Phase 


Duration 


1 
The 
Exploration 
Phase 
will 
begin 
at 
the 
Effective 
Date 
of 
this 
Agreement 
and 
will 
have 
the 
maximum 
duration 
specified 
in 
annex 
II 
(Work 
and 
Investment 
Program). 
The 
Exploration 
Phase 
will 
be 
divided 
into 
the 
number 
of 
periods 
(each, 
an 
“Exploration 
Period”) 
indicated 
in 
Annex 
II 
(Work 
and 
Investment 
Program), 
each 
having 
the 
duration 
indicated 
in 
Annex 
II 
(Work 
and 
Investment 
Program). 
Each 
Exploration 
Period 
following 
the 
first 
will 
begin 
at 
the 
conclusion 
of 
the 
immediately 
preceding 
Exploration 
Period. 
The 
last 
Exploration 
Period 
(and 
hence, 
the 
Exploration 
Phase) 
may 
be 
extended 
as 
provided 
in 
paragraphs 
6.2 
and 
7.1.2. 


1 
At 
the 
end 
of 
each 
Exploration 
Period, 
the 
Concessionaire 
shall 
relinquish 
to 
the 
ANP 
at 
least 
the 
percentage 
of 
original 
Concession 
Area 
indicated 
in 
Annex 
II 
(Work 
and 
Investment 
Program). 
The 
Concessionaire 
may 
relinquish 
more 
than 
the 
required 
minimum 
surface 
area 
at 
the 
end 
of 
an 
Exploration 
Period, 
but 
such 
voluntary 
relinquishment 
will 
not 
affect 
or 
reduce 
the 
Minimum 
Exploration 
Program 
for 
any 
subsequent 
Exploration 
Period. 
If 
the 
Concessionaire 
relinquishes 
more 
than 
the 
required 
percentage 
surface 
area 
at 
the 
end 
of 
an 
Exploration 
Period, 
the 
Concessionaire 
may 
count 
the 
excess 
toward 
the 
required 
relinquishment 
at 
the 
end 
of 
a 
subsequent 
Exploration 
Period 
or 
Periods. 


2 
At 
the 
end 
of 
the 
Exploration 
Phase, 
the 
Concessionaire 
may 
only 
keep 
the 
Development 
Areas 
approved 
by 
the 
ANP 
and 
shall 
relinquish 
all 
remaining 
areas, 
except 
as 
follows: 


(a) 
If 
the 
Concessionaire 
has 
submitted 
one 
or 
more 
Development 
Plans 
under 
the 
terms 
of 
paragraph 
9.1 
which 
have 
not 
yet 
been 
approved 
by 
the 
ANP 
under 
the 
terms 
of 
paragraph 
9.3, 
the 
Concessionaire 
may 
retain 
the 
areas 
covered 
by 
such 
Development

Plans, 
pending 
a 
final 
decision 
on 
such 
Plans, 
but 
may 
not 
do 
any 
work 
or 
conduct 
any 
Operations 
in 
such 
areas 
without 
the 
prior 
approval 
of 
the 
ANP. 


(b) 
If 
the 
Concessionaire 
has 
submitted 
a 
Declaration 
of 
Commerciality 
under 
the 
terms 
of 
paragraph 
7.1 
but 
has 
not 
yet 
submitted 
a 
Development 
Plan 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
Discovery 
concerned, 
the 
Concessionaire 
may 
retain 
the 
relevant 
area 
approved 
by 
the 
ANP, 
and 
covered 
by 
the 
Evaluation 
Plan, 
for 
the 
balance 
of 
the 
time 
provided 
by 
paragraph 
9.1 
for 
submission 
of 
the 
Development 
Plan 
and 
for 
the 
additional 
time 
required 
under 
the 
terms 
of 
paragraph 
9.3 
for 
review 
of 
such 
Development 
Plan, 
but 
may 
not 
do 
any 
work 
or 
conduct 
any 
Operations 
in 
the 
area 
concerned 
without 
the 
prior 
approval 
of 
the 
ANP. 
(c) 
If 
the 
concessionaire 
has 
made 
and 
notified 
a 
Discovery 
so 
close 
to 
the 
end 
of 
the 
Exploration 
Phase 
that 
it 
is 
not 
reasonably 
possible 
in 
the 
exercise 
of 
normal 
diligence 
and 
Oil 
Industry 
Best 
practice 
to 
complete 
Evaluation 
of 
the 
Discovery 
and 
to 
make 
a 
reasonable 
judgment 
as 
to 
the 
issuance 
of 
a 
Declaration 
of 
Commerciality 
before 
the 
end 
of 
the 
Exploration 
Phase, 
the 
Exploration 
Phase 
for 
the 
area 
concerned 
may 
be 
extended 
with 
the 
prior 
approval 
of 
the 
ANP 
of 
an 
Evaluation 
Plan. 
The 
Evaluation 
Plan 
shall 
be 
completed 
within 
the 
extension 
approved 
by 
the 
ANP. 
The 
extension 
to 
which 
this 
sub-item 
(c) 
refers 
is 
limited 
to 
the 
area 
covered 
by 
the 
Evaluation 
Plan 
approved 
by 
the 
ANP. 
If 
the 
Evaluation 
leads 
to 
a 
Declaration 
of 
Commerciality, 
the 
Concessionaire 
will 
be 
able 
to 
retain 
the 
approved 
area, 
in 
the 
terms 
defined 
in 
sub-item 
(b) 
above. 
3 
If 
a 
Concessionaire 
makes 
and 
provided 
notice 
of 
a 
Discovery 
near 
the 
end 
of 
an 
Exploration 
Period 
such 
that 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
complete, 
in 
accordance 
with 
Oil 
Industry 
Best 
Practice, 
an 
Evaluation 
of 
the 
discovery 
prior 
to 
the 
termination 
of 
this 
same 
Exploration 
Period, 
the 
Exploration 
Period 
can 
be 
extended 
with 
the 
prior 
approval 
of 
an 
Evaluation 
Plan 
by 
the 
ANP 
which 
plan, 
in 
any 
event, 
must 
be 
completed 
within 
the 
timeframe 
approved 
by 
the 
ANP. 


(a) 
The 
Period 
of 
extension 
provided 
under 
paragraph 
5.1.3 
will 
be 
subtracted 
form 
the 
term 
of 
the 
subsequent 
Exploration 
Period. 
(b) 
In 
the 
case 
of 
the 
final 
Exploration 
Period, 
the 
provisions 
of 
5.1.2(c) 
will 
apply. 
4 
As 
a 
condition 
of 
continuing 
the 
Exploration 
Phase 
from 
one 
Exploration 
Period 
to 
the 
next, 
the 
Concessionaire 
shall 
be 
obligated 
to 
provide 
the 
ANP, 
prior 
to 
the 
end 
of 
the 
Exploration 
Period 
underway, 
a 
stand-by 
letter 
of 
credit 
satisfying 
the 
requirements 
of 
Clause 
Fifteen 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
Minimum 
Exploration 
Program 
for 
the 
next 
succeeding 
Exploration 
Period. 
If 
the 
Concessionaire 
fails 
to 
provide 
a 
stand-by 
letter 
of 
credit 
by 
the 
end 
of 
the 
Exploration 
Period 
underway, 
the 
Exploration 
Phase 
will 
be 
automatically 
terminated 
and 
the 
Concessionaire 
will 
relinquish 
all 
the 
original 
Concession 
Area 
as 
per 
the 
terms 
in 
paragraph 
5.1.2. 


5 
The 
Concessionaire 
may 
voluntarily 
terminate 
the 
Exploration 
Phase 
at 
any 
time 
by 
written 
notice 
to 
the 
ANP, 
provided 
that 
such 
termination 
will 
not 
relieve 
the 
Concessionaire 
from 
fully 
completing 
the 
Minimum 
Exploration 
Program 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
Exploration 
Period 
underway.

During 
the 
Exploration 
Phase, 
the 
Concessionaire 
shall, 
in 
each 
Exploration 
Period 
complete 
in 
its 
entirety 
the 
Minimum 
Exploration 
Program 
for 
such 
Exploration 
Period 
as 
contained 
in 
Annex 
II 
(Work 
and 
Investment 
Program) 
and 
for 
this 
purpose 
shall 
expend 
the 
necessary 
amounts. 


1 
In 
the 
event 
that 
the 
Concessionaire 
judges, 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
exploration 
work 
completed 
in 
the 
Concession 
Area 
in 
the 
preceding 
Exploration 
Periods, 
that 
there 
are 
insufficient 
prospects 
in 
the 
Concession 
Area 
to 
justify 
completing 
the 
Minimum 
Exploration 
Program 
proposed 
for 
the 
subsequent 
Exploration 
Period, 
the 
Concessionaire 
should 
send 
to 
the 
ANP 
at 
least 
60 
days 
in 
advance 
of 
the 
next 
Exploration 
Period 
a 
request 
to 
modify 
the 
Minimum 
Exploration 
Program. 
Whether 
to 
accept 
the 
proposed 
reductions 
or 
modifications 
requested, 
or 
to 
place 
conditions 
on 
the 
acceptance 
of 
the 
request, 
such 
as 
an 
alternative 
Minimum 
Exploration 
Program 
or 
increase 
in 
the 
percentage 
of 
the 
area 
to 
be 
relinquished 
and 
contained 
in 
ANNEXO 
II 
– 
Work 
and 
Investment 
Program, 
will 
remain 
the 
exclusive 
judgment 
of 
the 
ANP. 


2 
The 
Non-compliance 
with 
the 
provisions 
of 
paragraph 
5.2 
shall 
entitle 
the 
ANP 
to 
draw 
on 
the 
stand-by 
letter 
of 
credit 
as 
provided 
in 
Clause 
Fifteen, 
without 
prejudice 
to 
other 
legal 
and 
contractual 
remedies. 


3 
The 
Concessionaire 
may 
at 
its 
discretion 
perform 
additional 
exploration 
work 
and 
activities 
beyond 
those 
included 
in 
the 
Minimum 
Exploration 
Program 
for 
the 
Exploration 
Period 
underway, 
providing 
the 
ANP 
with 
the 
program 
of 
additional 
exploration 
work 
and 
activities 
prior 
to 
initiating 
such 
work. 
The 
ANP, 
at 
its 
sole 
discretion, 
may 
credit 
or 
not, 
in 
whole 
or 
in 
part, 
theses 
additional 
exploration 
activities 
against 
obligations 
in 
the 
subsequent 
Exploration 
Period. 
Notwithstanding, 
each 
Exploration 
Period 
will 
always 
contain 
a 
Minimum 
Exploration 
Program 
to 
be 
completed 
by 
the 
Concessionaire.

All 
wells 
drilled 
in

seismic 
survey 
must 
reach 
the 
minimum 
objective 
defined 
in 
ANNEX 
II 
–

Prior 
to 
the 
end 
of 
the 
Exploration 
Phase, 
the 
Concessionaire, 
by 
means 
of 
notifying 
the 
ANP, 
may 
or 
may 
not 
issue 
a 
Declaration 
of 
Commerciality 
of 
the 
Discovery 
evaluated, 
pursuant 
to 
the 
Evaluation

justifying 
the 
proposal 
for 
the 
area 
that 
will 
be 
retained 
for 
the 
Development, 
and 
including 
justification 
for 
seeking 
the 
application 
of 
paragraphs

1 
The 
decision 
to 
issue 
or 
not 
a 
Declaration 
of 
Commerciality 
for 
the 
evaluated 
Discovery 
shall 
be 
decided 
by 
the 
concessionaire, 
at 
its

discretion, 
using 
for 
this 
the 
notification 
referred 
to 
in

2 
The 
Concessionaire 
may 
justify, 
before 
the 
ANP 
and 
in

7.1, 
that 
the 
quantity 
of 
the 
discovered 
and 
evaluated 
Non-Associated 
Natural 
Gas 
are 
such 
that 
(i) 
its 
commercial 
viability 
exclusively 
depends 
on 
the 
creation 
of 
the 
market 
or 
the 
installation 
of 
Transportation 
infrastructure 
to 
handle 
simultaneously 
the 
Concessionaire’s 
and 
other 
Concessionaires’ 
Production 
and, 
also 
that 
(ii) 
the 
creation 
of 
such 
market 
or 
installation 
of 
such 
infrastructure 
will 
be 
possible 
within 
a 
period 
of 
as 
much 
as 
5

years. 
In 
this 
case, 
the 
Concessionaire 
will 
have 
the 
right 
to 
request 
the 
ANP, 
and 
the 
latter, 
at 
its 
sole 
discretion 
may 
concede, 
a 
maximum 
period 
of 
5 
(five) 
years, 
from 
the 
notice 
made 
by 
the 
Concessionaire 
pursuant 
to 
paragraph 
7.1 
to 
issue 
or 
not 
the 
relevant 
Declaration 
of 
Commerciality. 
In 
the 
event 
such

is 
obligated 
to 
present, 
attached

for 
the 
evaluated 
Discovery, 
pursuant

The 
Concessionaire 
may 
request 
the 
extension 
of 
the 
term 
established 
in 
paragraph 


8.1. 
In 
order 
to 
do 
so, 
the 
Concessionaire 
shall 
send, 
at 
least 
12 
(twelve) 
months 
prior 
to 
the 
end 
of 
this

a 
written 
request 
to 
the 
ANP 
duly 
accompanied 
by 
a 
Development 
Plan, 
prepared 
in 
accordance 
with 
applicable 
Brazilian 
legislation 
or, 
in 
the 
event 
the 
ANP 
does 
not 
request 
additional 
investments 
in 
the 
Field 
for 
which 
the 
term 
extension 
is 
requested 
pursuant 
to 
paragraph 
8.2.1,m 
a 
Production 
Program 
which 
is 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
Development 
Plan 
already 
in 
effect. 
2 
The 
ANP, 
within 
a 
maximum 
period 
of 
3 
(three) 
months 
for 
the 
receipt 
of 
the 
request 
from 
the 
Concessionaire, 
will 
inform 
the 
latter 
of 
its 
decision, 
it 
being 
understood 
that 
the 
ANP 
shall 
not 
unjustly 
reject 
the 
Concessionaire’s 
proposal, 
being 
able 
to 
refuse 
it 
in 
totum 
or 
request 
amendments, 
including 
additional 
investments 
in 
the 
Field 
subject 
to 
extension. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
the 
Concessionaire 
will 
not 
unjustifiably 
refuse 
requests 
by 
the 
ANP 
for 
additional 
investments 
in 
the 
Field 
subject 
to 
extension. 


3 
The 
lack 
of 
respond 
from 
the 
ANP, 
within 
the 
3 
(three) 
month 
period 
referred 
above, 
will 
cause 
the 
implicit 
approval 
of 
the 
Concessionaire’s 
proposal, 
extending 
this 
Agreement 
on 
the 
term 
contemplated 
therein.

By 
written 
notice 
made 
within 
at 
least 
8 
(eight) 
months 
before 
the 
end 
of 
the 
term 
established 
in 
paragraph 
8.1, 
the 
ANP 
may 
request 
the 
Concessionaire 
to 
continue 
operating 
in 
a 
Field 
for 
an 
additional 
time, 
which 
the 
ANP 
may 
consider 
convenient, 
with 
the 
consequent 
extension 
of 
this 
Agreement. 
The 
ANP’S 
request 
shall 
not 
be 
refused 
by 
the 
Concessionaire 
without 
justification, 
it 
being 
understood 
that 
the 
latter 
shall 
not 
be 
obliged 
to 
continue 
with 
the 
operation 
under 
conditions 
that, 
by 
its 
own 
criterion, 
might 
be 
un-economic.

The 
lack 
o 
response 
by 
the 
Concessionaire, 
within 
the 
3 
(three) 
month 
period 
following 
the 
ANP’S

Unitized 
Production 


Agreement 
for 
Unitization 
of 
Production 


1 
In 
the 
case 
of 
a 
Discovery 
under 
this 
Agreement, 
in 
which 
the 
relevant 
Pool 
may 
extend 
outside 
the 
Concession 
Area, 
the 
Concessionaire 
will 
officially 
inform 
this 
fact 
to 
the 
ANP 
at 
the 
time 
the 
Concessionaire 
becomes 
aware 
of 
such 
extension. 


1 
If 
another 
Concessionaire 
has 
rights 
to 
the 
adjacent 
area 
to 
which 
the 
relevant 
Pool 
extends, 
the 
ANP, 
will 
notify 
such 
Concessionaire 
with 
the 
purpose 
of 
having 
all 
interested 
parties 
get 
together 
and 
execute 
an 
agreement 
which 
results 
in 
common 
development 
and 
the 
unitization 
of 
Production. 


2 
If 
there 
is 
no 
Concessionaire 
with 
rights 
to 
such 
adjacent 
area, 
but 
the 
ANP 
in 
its 
sole 
discretion 
believes 
that 
a 
sufficient 
Evaluation 
of 
the 
Pool 
or 
Pools 
concerned 
has 
been 
done 
in 
order 
to 
permit 
the 
ANP 
to 
form 
a 
reasonable 
judgment 
regarding 
unitization, 
the 
ANP 
itself 
may 
act 
as 
if 
it 
were 
the 
Concessionaire 
of 
such 
Area 
for 
purposes 
of 
negotiating 
and 


422167.v1 



-27 


executing 
the 
agreement 
for 
unitization 
of 
Production 
contemplated 
in 
paragraph 
12.2. 
However, 
at 
any 
time 
prior, 
during 
or 
after 
such 
negotiation 
and 
execution 
of 
the 
agreement, 
the 
ANP 
may 
offer 
for 
bidding 
the 
referred 
Block 
or 
Blocks, 
in 
which 
case, 
once 
the 
relevant 
Concessionaire(s) 
is 
selected, 
these 
will 
assume 
their 
responsibilities 
pursuant 
to 
this 
Clause 
Twelve 
and 
be 
obligated 
to 
fulfill 
the 
unitization 
agreement 
signed 
by 
the 
ANP. 


Rights 
and 
Obligations 
of 
Interested 
Concessionaires 


2 
The 
agreement 
referred 
to 
in 
paragraphs 
12.1.1 
or 
12.1.2 
will 
equitable 
contemplate 
the 
rights 
and 
obligations 
of 
the 
interested 
Concessionaires, 
defining 
the 
unitized 
area, 
it 
Operator, 
the 
participation 
of 
each 
one 
in 
the 
Exploration, 
Evaluation, 
Development 
and 
production 
of 
the 
Pool, 
the 
relevant 
Development 
Plan 
and 
the 
time 
period 
for 
its 
presentation 
to 
the 
ANP, 
the 
payment 
of 
Government 
and 
Third-Parties 
participations, 
respecting, 
for 
each 
involved 
Concessionaire, 
the 
amounts 
specified 
in 
the 
relevant 
Concession 
Agreement, 
and, 
in 
general 
all 
other 
aspects 
usually 
covered 
in 
this 
kind 
of 
agreement 
according 
to 
Oil 
Industry 
Best 
Practice 
and 
to 
the 
terms 
of 
the 
applicable 
Brazilian 
legislation 
and 
Concession 
Agreements 
related 
to 
the 
Blocks 
in 
which 
the 
unitized 
area 
is 
located. 


3 
If 
so 
requested, 
the 
ANP 
may 
act 
as 
mediator 
in 
the 
negotiations 
of 
the 
agreements 
for 
unitization 
of 
Production, 
seeking 
the 
reconcile 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
interested 
Concessionaires 
in 
order 
for 
them 
to 
reach 
a 
consensus. 


4 
If 
there 
is 
no 
Concessionaire 
for 
adjacent 
areas 
and/or 
the 
Evaluation 
of 
the 
Pool 
is 
insufficient 
to 
permit 
meaningful 
discussions 
regarding 
unitization, 
the 
Concessionaire 
may 
nonetheless 
proceed 
with 
the 
Declaration 
of 
Commerciality, 
as 
provided 
in 
this 
Agreement. 
If 
the 
Concessionaire 
believes 
that 
Development 
of 
those 
parts 
of 
Pool 
lying 
inside 
the 
Concession 
Area 
can 
be 
done 
in 
accordance 
with 
applicable 
Brazilian 
laws 
and 
Oil 
Industry 
Best 
Practice, 
it 
may 
submit 
a 
Development 
Plan, 
conforming 
to 
that 
which 
is 
defined 
in 
Clause 
Nine. 


Modifications 
to 
Agreement 
by 
ANP 


3 
If 
the 
Concessionaire 
enters 
into 
an 
agreement 
for 
unitization 
of 
Production, 
the 
ANP 
shall 
have 
60 
(sixty) 
days 
form 
the 
receipt 
of 
the 
agreement 
duly 
signed 
by 
all 
involved 
Concessionaires, 
to 
request 
any 
amendments 
the 
ANP 
deems 
advisable. 
In 
the 
event 
the 
ANP 
does 
not 
report 
within 
such 
period, 
the 
referred 
agreement 
will 
be 
considered 
final 
and 
definitive. 
In 
the 
event 
the 
ANP 
requests 
amendments, 
the 
Concessionaire 
and 
the 
other 
interested 
parties 
shall 
have 
60 
(sixty) 
days 
from 
the 
date 
the 
request 
was 
made 
to 
discuss 
them 
with 
the 
ANP. 
Once 
the 
agreement 
for 
unitization 
of 
Production 
becomes 
final 
and 
definitive, 
the 
interested 
Concessionaires 
will 
be 
obligated 
to 
fully 
comply 
with 
it 
and 
any 
amendments 
to 
it 
are

contemplated 
in 
this 
paragraph 
12.2. 


Suspension 
of

of 
Production 
contemplated 
herein 
not 
be 
approved 
by 
the 
ANP, 
pursuant 
to 
paragraph 
12.2, 
the

of 
the 
relevant 
Pool 
will 
be 
suspended, 
unless 
otherwise 
approved 
by 
the 
ANP, 
at 
its 
sole 
discretion,

Operator 


2 
The 
Concessionaire 
hereby 
designates 
the 
Operator 
to 
carry 
out 
and 
execute 
all 
Operations 
and 
activities 
under 
this 
Agreement 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
concessionaire 
and 
to 
submit 
all

to 
the 
ANP, 
and 
to 
receive 
all 
responses, 
requests, 
solicitations, 
proposals 
and 
other 
communications 
from 
the 
ANP, 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
Concessionaire. 
The 
Operator 
shall 
be 
responsible 
for 
the 
full 
and 
timely 
performance 
of 
all 
obligations 
of 
the 
Concessionaire 
under 
this 
Agreement 
with 
respect 
to 
any 
aspect 
of 
Operations 
for 
which 
it 
is 
the 
Operator, 
except 
the 
obligations 
set 
forth 
in 
Clauses 
Twenty-Eight 
and 
Thirty-Three. 


1 
The 
initial 
Operator 
is 
___________which 
has 
executed 
this 
Agreement 
in 
its 
capacity 
as 
Operator 
on 
the 
Effective 
Date. 
A 
replacement 
Operator 
or 
additional 
Operators 
for 
specific 
activities 
may 
be 
designated 
as 
provided 
herein. 


2 
The 
Operator 
will 
at 
all 
times 
hold 
at 
least 
a 
30% 
participation 
interest 
in 
each 
Exploration 
area 
or 
Field 
for 
which 
it 
is 
acting 
as 
Operator. 
Any 
failure 
by 
the 
Operator 
to 
hold 
such 
percentage 
interest 
will 
constitute 
a 
material 
breach 
of 
this 
Agreement 
except 
in 
the 
case 
where 
unitization 
of 
production 
is 
necessary 
in 
which 
event 
the 
Operator 
must 
hold 
a 
minimum 
participation 
of 
15% 
in 
each 
Field 
in 
which 
it 
is 
acting 
as 
Operator. 
If, 
as 
a 
result 
of 
a 
prospective 
transfer 
or 
otherwise, 
it 
is 
anticipated 
that 
an 
Operator 
would 
at 
any 
time 
hold 
less 
than 
such 
30% 
interest 
the 
Concessionaires 
will 
arrange 
for 
a 
new 
Operator 
to 
be 
designated 
and 
to 
be 
submitted 
for 
approval 
to 
the 
ANP 
prior 
to 
the 
removal 
of 
the 
former 
Operator.

The 
Concessionaires 
may 
nominate 
a 
Person 
other 
than 
the 
original 
Operator 
to 
act 
as 
Operator 
with 
respect 
to 
any 
Exploration 
or 
Development 
or 
Field 
activity; 
provided 
that 
such 
Person 
can 
demonstrate 
adequate 
experience, 
qualifications 
and 
financial 
capacity. 
The 
person 
so 
nominated 
must 
hold 
the 
minimum 
percentage 
interest 
provided 
above. 
Such 
nomination 
is 
subject 
to 
prior 
approval 
by 
the 
ANP.

The 
Operator 
may 
resign 
as 
Operator 
at 
any 
time 
by 
so 
notifying 
the 
other 
Parties 
at 
least 
ninety 
(90) 
days 
prior 
to 
the 
effective 
date 
of 
such 
resignation.

5 
The 
Operator 
may 
be 
removed 
by 
the 
ANP 
if 
the 
Operator 
has 
committed 
a 
material 
breach 
of 
this 
Agreement 
and 
has 
failed 
to 
cure 
that 
breach 
within 
ninety 
(90) 
days 
of

of 
an 
Operator 
as 
provided 
above, 
the 
Concessionaires 
shall 
meet 
as

paragraph 
13.2, 
and 
shall 
present 
such 
nomination 
to

The 
Concessionaires 
acknowledge 
that 
the 
ANP 
may, 
as 
a

hereby 
commits 
to 
use 
it 
most 
advance 
technical 
experience 
and 
technology,

as 
they 
are 
appropriate 
and 
economically 
justified, 
for

Production 
of 
the 
discovered 
Pools.

Area, 
of 
any 
persons, 
services, 
procedures,

will 
be 
the 
exclusive

of 
the 
Concessionaire,

be 
responsible 
for 
the 
assistance 
described 
in 
paragraph 
14.3. 
12 
The 
Concessionaire 
shall 
be 
liable

resulting 
from 
the 
referred 
violation,

full 
force 
and

Area, 
attaching 
in 
this 
event, 
a 
work

about 
the 
expected 
drilling 
operations, 
as 
well 
as 
about 
the 
equipment 
and 
materials 
to 
be 
used. 


13 
The 
Concessionaire 
may 
interrupt 
the 
drilling 
of 
a 
well 
and 
abandon 
it 
before 
reaching 
the 
expected 
geological 
goal, 
in 
accordance 
with 
applicable 
Brazilian 
laws 
and 
Oil 
Industry 
Best 
Practice. 
If 
the 
well 
concerned 
represents 
part 
of 
the 
Minimum 
Exploration 
Program 
and 
it 
does 
not 
reach 
the 
target 
horizon, 
it 
will 
not 
count 
in 
satisfaction 
of 
the 
Minimum 
Exploration 
Program 
unless 
the 
ANP, 
at 
its 
sole 
discretion, 
determines 
otherwise.

Period. 
Reductions 
in 
respect 
of 
amount 
allocable 
to

be 
made 
only 
when 
a 
well 
actually 
reaches

will 
be 
made 
progressively 
as 
seismic 
data 
is 
acquired, 
processed 
and 
delivered 
to 
the 
ANP. 
This 
reduction 
shall 
be 
made 
in 
proportions 
of 
the 
total 
seismic 
obligation 
in 
the 
Minimum 
Exploration 
Program 
with 
minimal 
increments 
of 
250-line 
(two

the 
ANP 
that 
all 
of 
the 
required 
Minimum

Program 
for 
the 
Exploration 
Period 
concerned 
has 
been 
performed. 
Absent 
disagreement 
regarding 
completion 
of 
the 
work, 
the 
ANP

certifications 
within 
30 
(thirty)

following 
the 
presentation 
by 
the

and 
abandonment 
Operations, 
including 
with 
regard

of 
surface 
and 
sub-surface 
installations,

and 
in 
the 
sea, 
shall 
be 
done 
in 
accordance 
with 
applicable 
Brazilian 
legislation 
and 
Oil 
Industry 
Best 
practices, 
as 
well 
as 
in 
observance 
of 
the 
provisions 
of 
Clause 
Twenty-One. 


6 
When 
it 
refers 
to 
a 
Field 
the 
deactivation 
and 
abandonment 
plan 
for 
such 
Field 
and 
the 
mechanisms 
to 
make 
the 
necessary 
funds 
available 
will 
be 
addressed 
in 
the 
relevant 
Development 
Plan, 
in 
accordance 
with 
paragraph 
9.1, 
and 
periodically 
revised, 
throughout 
the 
Production 
Phase. 
These 
revisions 
will 
be 
subject 
to 
the 
provisions 
of 
paragraph 
9.4. 


7 
The 
cost 
of 
deactivation 
and 
abandonment 
operations 
in 
a 
field 
will 
be 
established 
in 
a 
form 
to 
cover 
the 
abandonment 
activities 
specific 
to 
the 
wells, 
deactivation 
and 
removal 
of 
lines 
and 
installations 
and 
rehabilitation 
of 
areas, 
in 
conformance 
with 
applicable 
Brazilian 
legislation. 


8 
The 
Concessionaire 
will 
present 
an 
abandonment 
guarantee, 
secured 
by 
a 
letter 
of 
credit, 
sinking 
fund, 
or 
other 
guarantees 
acceptable 
by 
the 
ANP, 
in 
conformance 
with 
applicable 
Brazilian 
legislation. 


9 
The 
value 
of 
the 
abandonment 
guarantee 
for 
a 
field 
will 
be 
revised 
if 
there 
are 
approved 
revisions 
to 
the 
Development 
Plan 
of 
this 
field 
that 
will 
alter 
the 
cost 
of 
abandonment 
operations 
or 
the 
total 
volume 
of 
oil 
and 
natural 
gas 
production 
originally 
envisaged. 


10 
When 
the 
abandonment 
guarantee 
is 
constituted 
by 
a 
sinking 
fund, 
any 
remaining 
balance 
after 
the 
completion 
of 
all 
the 
necessary 
operations 
to 
deactivate 
and 
abandon 
the 
field 
will 
revert 
exclusively 
to 
the 
Concessionaire. 


11 
The 
presentation 
of 
the 
abandonment 
guarantee 
does 
not 
remove 
the 
Concessionaire’s 
obligation 
to 
complete, 
at 
his 
cost 
and 
risk, 
all 
of 
the 
operations 
necessary 
to 
deactivate 
and 
abandon 
the 
field.

Clause

Breach, 
Rescission 
and 
Termination 
of 
the 
Agreement 


Cure 


1 
Notwithstanding 
paragraph 
30.3, 
this 
Agreement 
can 
be 
terminated 
in 
the 
event 
that 
any 
Concessionaire 
breaches 
its 
obligations 
under 
this 
Agreement, 
and 
such 
breach 
is 
not 
corrected 
within 
a 
period 
determined 
and 
advised 
by 
the 
ANP 
which 
will 
not 
be 
less 
than 
ninety 
(90) 
days 
except 
in 
cases 
of 
extreme 
urgency. 
This 
termination 
will 
not 
apply 
where 
the 
Concessionaire 
has 
cured 
the 
breach 
within 
the 
period 
stipulated 
or 
where 
the 
ANP, 
in 
its 
sole 
discretion, 
determines 
that 
the 
Concessionaire 
is 
diligently 
pursuing 
a 
remedy 
for 
the 
breach. 
In 
the 
event 
that 
any, 
but 
not 
all, 
of 
the 
Concessionaires, 
gives 
rise 
to 
a 
termination 
right 
in 
the 
part 
of 
the 
ANP 
in 
accordance 
with 
this 
Clause, 
such 
termination 
right 
will 
only 
apply 
to 
the 
defaulting 
Concessionaire(s). 
Upon 
a 
termination 
with 
respect 
to 
a 
defaulting 
Concessionaire, 
such 
Concessionaire’s 
rights 
and 
obligations 
under 
this 
Agreement 
can 
be 
transferred 
to 
the 
non-defaulting 
Concessionaires, 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
relevant 
Consortium 
Agreement. 


1 
Termination 
of 
this 
contract 
will 
also 
occur 
in 
the 
event 
the 
Concessionaire 
or 
any 
of 
its 
members 
are 
declared 
bankrupt, 
insolvent 
or 
in 
receivership. 
In 
these 
cases, 
the 
Concessionaire 
or 
the 
individual 
members 
of 
the 
Concessionaire 
will 
have 
90 
(ninety) 
days 
of 
the 
date 
of 
such 
an 
event, 
to 
transfer 
its 
indivisible 


422167.v1 



-47 


participation 
in 
the 
rights 
and 
obligations 
of 
this 
Agreement, 
pursuant 
to 
Clause 
Twenty-Eight. 
In 
the 
event 
that 
such 
Concessionaire 
does 
not 
effect 
such 
a 
transfer 
or 
provide 
such 
a 
guarantee 
within 
such 
time 
period, 
the 
ANP 
may 
terminate 
such 
Concessionaire’s 
rights 
and 
interests 
under 
this 
Agreement 
without 
prejudice, 
in 
this 
case, 
to 
the 
rights 
and 
demands 
of 
the 
Concessionaire. 


Consequences 
of 
Rescission

Once 
this 
Agreement 
is 
rescinded 
by 
the 
ANP, 
pursuant 
to 
paragraph 
30.1, 
the 
Concessionaire 
shall 
be 
liable 
for

or 
not 
of 
the 
activities 
for 
which 
the 
dispute 
or 
controversy 
refers 
to, 
until 
its 
solution, 
using 
as 
criterion 
for 
this 
decision 
the 
need 
to 
avoid 
risk 
to 
personnel 
or 
property 
of 
any 
nature 
whatsoever, 
especially 
regarding 
the

in 
the

of 
fortuity 
or 
force 
majeure, 
in 
the 
form 
of 
article

exclusively 


422167.v1

occur 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
affected 
portion 
of 
the

not 
being 
able 
to 
be 
argued 
for 
its 
whole 
exoneration. 


Notice 
of 
Occurrence 


2 
Once 
circumstances, 
which 
justify 
the 
invocation 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
fortuity 
or 
force 
majeure 
occur, 
the 
affected 
Party 
shall 
immediately 
notify, 
in 
writing, 
the 
other 
Party, 
specifying 
such 
circumstances, 
its 
causes

Amendment 
or 
Termination 
of 
the 
Agreement 


3 
Once 
the 
fortuity 
or 
force 
majeure 
is 
overcome, 
the 
debtor 
shall 
comply 
with 
the 
affected 
obligations, 
considering, 
for 
such 
compliance, 
that 
the 
term 
period 
of 
this 
Agreement 
is 
extended, 
for 
the 
duration 
of 
the 
fortuity 
or 
force 
majeure. 
However, 
depending 
on 
the 
extension 
and 
seriousness 
of 
the 
effects 
of 
the 
fortuity 
majeure, 
the 
Parties 
may 
agree 
to 
amend 
this
