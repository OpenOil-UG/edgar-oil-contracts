the properties necessary for the accumulation of petroleum in commercial quantities and 
which reflects the maximum depth at which any such accumulation can be reasonably 
expected. 

 

(d) Where in any Exploration Period the Contractor has carried out more than the minimum 
technical work obligations specified in sub-article (b) of this Article, for that period the 
Contractor shall be permitted to credit such excess work obligation as satisfying work 
obligations specified in that sub-article for the next succeeding Exploration Period. 




 

(e) The Exploration Licence issued to TPDC, pursuant to Article 3 and any extension thereof, 
shall be on terms and conditions relating to Work Programmes and Minimum Expenditure 
which correspond to the obligation of the Contractor under this Article. Accordingly, it is 
understood and agreed that discharge by the Contractor of its obligations under this Article 
in respect of any Exploration Period will discharge for that period the obligations of TPDC 
relating to the Work Programme and Minimum Expenditure in respect of the licence issued 
pursuant to Article 3, and the terms and conditions of the licence aforesaid and any 
extension thereof shall be drawn up accordingly. 

 




 

(f) The minimum expenditure for each period specified in sub-article (b) of this Article shall 
not have been satisfied unless the total expenditure attributable to the work described in 
sub-article (b) equals or exceeds the same mentioned in the said sub-article; provided that 
for this purpose all such attributable actual expenditures shall be adjusted, commencing 
from the Effective Date, by multiplying each of them by the following factor I, where: 

I = A/B 

 

and where: 

 

A is the United States Industrial Goods Producer Price Index (USIGPPI) as reported 
for the first time in the monthly publication “International Financial Statistics” of 
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the section “Prices, Production, 
Employment” for the Month of the Effective Date. 

 

B is the USIGPPI as reported for the first time in the aforesaid IMF publication for the 
month of the expenditure in question. 

 

(g) For the purpose of this Article, any expenditure by the Contractor on an appraisal 
programme required to discharge the obligations of TPDC under Section 32 (2) of the Act 
shall be treated as expenditure for the purpose of satisfying the minimum expenditure 
obligations set out in sub-article (b) of this Article. 

 

(h) No relinquishment shall relieve Contractor of accrued, but unfulfilled obligations under the 
Contract. In the event the Contractor desires to relinquish its rights hereunder in the whole 
of the Contract Area without having fulfilled all accrued Minimum Work Programme under 
this Article, TPDC shall be paid, prior to the date of such proposed total relinquishment, the 
sum equal to the remaining amount of the non-discharged guarantees corresponding to such 
accrued, but unfulfilled work obligations. 

 
 


ARTICLE 6: ANNUAL WORK PROGRAMMES AND BUDGET 

 

(a) Within thirty (30) days of the Effective Date, the Contractor shall prepare and submit to 
TPDC a detailed Work Programme and Budget setting forth the Exploration Operations 
which Contractor proposes to carry out in the Calendar Year in which the Exploration 
Licence is first issued to TPDC hereunder and the estimated cost thereof. 

 

(b) So long as the Exploration Licence issued to TPDC hereunder remains in force and at least 
three (3) months prior to the beginning of each subsequent Calendar Year, Contractor shall 
prepare and submit to TPDC a detailed Work Programme and Budget setting forth the 
Exploration Operations which Contractor propose to carry out in that Calendar Year and 
the estimated cost thereof. 

 

(c) Every Work Programme and Budget submitted to TPDC pursuant to this Article and every 
revision or amendment thereof shall be consistent with the requirements set out in Article 5 
relating to work and expenditure for the Exploration Period within which the Work 
Programme and Budget will fall. 

 

(d) Every Work Programme and Budget and, as the case may be, the appraisal programme 
referred to in Article 8(g) submitted by Contractor to TPDC shall be reviewed by a joint 
committee to be established by TPDC and Contractor pursuant to Article 7. Should TPDC 
wish to propose a revision of the proposed Work Programme and Budget or appraisal 
programme, as the case may be, TPDC shall, within three (3) weeks after receipt thereof, so 
notify the Contractor specifying in reasonable detail its reasons. Promptly thereafter, the 
parties will meet and endeavor to agree upon the revisions proposed by TPDC following 
review by the Advisory Committee, Contractor shall make such revisions as it deems 
appropriate and submit the Work Programme and Budget or, without prejudice to Article 
8(f), appraisal program, as appropriate, to TPDC. 

 

(e) Subject to Article 5, upon giving notice to TPDC, Contractor may amend any Work 
Programme or Budget or any revised Work Programme or Budget submitted to TPDC, but, 
subject to any such amendment, Contractor shall carry out the Exploration Operations set 
forth in the Work Programme or revised Work Programme and spend not less than the sum 
provided for in the Budget or revised Budget. In the case of an appraisal program, any 
amendment thereto proposed to TPDC by Contractor will be subject to section 32(2) of the 
Act; where an appraisal programme has been agreed by the Advisory Committee as 
referred to in Article 8(f), no amendment shall be made without the approval of the 
Advisory Committee. A notice under this sub-article shall state the reasons why, in the 
opinion of Contractor, an amendment is necessary or desirable. 

 

(f) Where Contractor has discharged its obligations under this Article, the Minister will not 
suspend or cancel any Exploration Licence granted to TPDC hereunder by reason only that 
TPDC has failed to comply strictly with the requirements of paragraph (a) of sub-section 
(1) of Section 30 of the Act or has failed to meet the requirements deemed to be included in 
an Exploration Licence by reasons of that provision.

discovery is of eventual commercial interest and TPDC agrees with such determination, 
then the Minister shall be advised to agree to allow the Contractor to retain the Discovery 
Block for the duration of the Exploration Licence and any renewal thereof, provided that: 

 

(i) the determination of eventual and/or potential commerciality shall be based on 
relevant economic criteria, including but not limited to, potential Petroleum 
production rates, Petroleum prices, development costs, operating costs as well as 
any other relevant criteria, as established by the Contractor; 

(ii) Contractor shall reassess the commerciality of Discovery every two (2) years, based

made by the above mentioned chosen institution, shall be borne equally by the 
Parties to the dispute. The determination of the expert shall be final and binding; 

 



(vi) if the results of Contractor’s re-assessment determine that the Discovery is no longer 
of potential commercial interest, the provisions of Article 8 (c) below shall apply. 

 

(c) If Contractor informs TPDC that in its opinion the discovery is not of potential commercial 
interest then TPDC will have the option to require the Contractor to surrender its rights and 
be relieved of its obligations in respect of the Block or Blocks comprising the geological 
feature (as outlined by the relevant seismic data) in which the discovery is located. 

 

(d) The option in sub-articles (c) of this Article will lapse if not exercised by TPDC within 
twelve months from the date on which notice was given to TPDC by Contractor pursuant to 
sub-article (a) of this Article and during the said period of twelve months, and any 
subsequent period if the option lapses without being exercised, the Minister will in respect 
of the discovery to which that notice relates exempt TPDC from the requirements of 
Section 32 (2) of the Act. 

 

(e) Where pursuant to sub-article (c) of this Article, Contractor has surrendered its rights and 
been relieved of its obligations in respect of any Block or Blocks in which the discovery is 
located, notwithstanding that the said Block or Blocks continue to be subject to the 
Exploration Licence referred to in sub-article (b) of Article 3, the said Block or Blocks shall 
not for the purpose of this Agreement, constitute part of the Contract Area. 

 

(f) Where Contractor, pursuant to sub-article (a) of this Article, has informed TPDC that, in its

practicable thereafter, submit to TPDC, for the consideration of the Advisory Committee, 
its proposals for an appraisal programme to meet the requirements of Section 32 (2) of the 
Act. 

 

(g) Subject to Article 13(b) where, 

 

(i) the Advisory Committee has agreed on an appraisal programme submitted by 
Contractor as aforesaid or on a revision thereof; and 
 
(ii) a Location has been declared; 

 

the Minister may, to the extent necessary, extend the period within which an application 
may be made by TPDC for a Development Licence, if TPDC at the request of the 
Contractor applies on that behalf, for a period of two (2) years, so as to ensure that the 
appraisal programme can be carried out and the results thereof assessed before the said 
period expires. 

 

(h) Where Contractor has requested TPDC to make application for a Development Licence, the 
proposals accompanying such application, pursuant to paragraph (a) of Section 36 of the

(i) Where a Location has been declared, the Minister will not, without the prior agreement 
between TPDC and Contractor, give any direction to TPDC, pursuant to Section 34(1) of 
the Act, provided however that, if the application is made for a Development Licence in 
respect of any Block or Blocks within that Location, nothing in this sub-article shall be 
construed as limiting the scope of any notice which the Minister may give to TPDC 
pursuant to Section 37(2) of the Act. 

 

(j) Where the Exploration Licence is due to expire during the above mentioned period allowed 
by the Minister for application for a Development Licence under Article 8(g), or, in the

respect of an Appraisal Programme) incurred in the first and every subsequent 
Development Area from the date such notice is rendered. 




 (ii) Where TPDC does elect to participate in the development of a discovery, TPDC shall 

 pay its share of Contract Expenses. 

(iii) If TPDC fails to pay its share of Contract Expenses and such failure is not rectified 
within a period of thirty (30) days after receipt of a written notice of such failure from the 
Contractor, the Contractor shall advance by way of loan up to 100% of unpaid amount of 
TPDC’s share of Contract Expenses. Such Contract Expenses shall bear interest at a rate 
of LIBOR plus two percent (2 %) and will be recovered on a preferential basis from 
TPDC’s Share of Profit Oil/Gas. 

 

(c) Joint operations shall be conducted hereunder in accordance with the terms and conditions of 
a mutually acceptable form of Operating Agreement to be concluded between TPDC and the 
Contractor immediately following the first notice given to Contractor by TPDC, pursuant to 
sub-paragraph (i) of this sub-Article. The operating Agreement aforesaid will include 
provisions to give effect to the following principles: 

  

(i) Contractor shall be the sole Operator of the Joint Operations under properly defined 
rights and obligations and will carry out all operations pursuant to work 
programmes and budgets approved by a Joint Operating Committee. The parties 
may review at any time the Operatorship of the Joint Operations; 

(ii) A Joint Operating Committee shall be established on which TPDC and Contractor

two (2) or more non-Affiliated Parties holding an aggregate not less than sixty five 
percent (65%) of all Participating Interests (“Pass Mark Vote”); except for decisions 
relating to TPDC participation in any exploration and appraisal cash calls as a co- 
venturer as per Article 9(b) and 9(c)(iii). In case of disagreement, a third party 
expert, who shall be mutually agreed upon and selected, will resolve the 
disagreement and his decision shall be final and binding on the parties to the 
disagreement. 

(iii) TPDC shall be liable to contribute the Participating Interests (as contained in 
Article 9(b)(i)) of the Contract Expenses other than Exploration Expenses (such 
Exploration Expenses to include expenses in respect of an appraisal programme) of 



Joint Operations in all Development Areas in respect of which TPDC has elected to 
participate. The balance of such expenses shall be contributed by the Contractor. 

(iv) The contributions aforesaid shall be in such major convertible currencies as may be 
required from time to time by the Operator for the Joint Operations approved by the 
Joint Operating Committee but (if there exist expenditures in Tanzanian Shillings), 
TPDC shall have preference for payment in such Tanzanian Shillings and such 
amounts will count towards the total contribution which TPDC is obliged to make 
in respect of its share in Joint Operations. 

 

(v) Failure by any party to meet calls for funds within the time limits agreed shall result 
in liability for interest on the unpaid amounts for the period that such amounts 
remain unpaid at LIBOR + 2%. 

(vi) If, after the election allowed in paragraph 10(b), TPDC fails to pay its share of 
Development and/or Production Expenditures and such failure is not rectified within 
a period of thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice thereof from the Operator, 
TPDC shall be deemed to have elected on the date of receipt of the notice to have 
agreed with the Contractor entities that they shall carry TPDC´s share of such 
expenditures, and the Contractor entities shall pay any of TPDC´s unpaid 
expenditures before the date of the deemed election and also TPDC´s share of any 
expenditures incurred after the date of the deemed election recovering such 
expenditures in accordance with Article 10(c)(v)(b). Notwithstanding the above 
procedure, if, during the above mentioned thirty (30) days period to rectify the 
failure to pay, TPDC notifies the Operator that it has provided to rectify such failure 
to pay in a period not greater than thirty (30) days from such TPDC's notification to 
Operator, then, the carry from Contractor's entities shall not be triggered unless such 
notification is not done during this thirty (30) days period. For avoidance of doubt 
any amounts not remedied other than by the carry procedure herein established are 
subject to paragraph (iv) above from the date of failure to pay until the date such 
failure to pay is finally rectified. The Contractor entities shall have the right to 
recover such expenditures out of the TPDC’s Cost Oil as defined in Article 12(b) (i).

application was made at the request of the Contractor, shall be US$ 200 per sq. km . 

 

(b) The sum in United States dollars referred to in paragraph (a) above shall be adjusted 
annually by dividing the sum by the following factor I, where: 

 

I = C/D 

and where: 

 

C is the United States Industrial Goods Producer Price Index (USIGPPI) as reported 
for the first time in monthly publication “International Financial Statistics” of the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the section “Prices, Production, 
Employment” for the Month during which the Exploration Licence is first issued to 
TPDC hereunder. 

 

D is the USIGPPI as reported for the first time in the aforesaid IMF publication for 
the Month in which the first and any subsequent anniversary of the date on which 
the Exploration Licence was first issued falls. 

 

For the purpose of this Article 10, and Articles 5(f) and 18(c), in the event that the 
USIGPPI ceases to be published the parties to this agreement shall agree on an appropriate 
replacement index. 

 



ARTICLE 11: RECOVERY OF COSTS AND EXPENSES AND 

PRODUCTION SHARING 

 

(a) Where a company has more than one exploration licence within a Contract Area (prior to 
any relinquishments) there shall be no “ring fencing” of Exploration or Development 
Licences in such Contract Area. Provided that, in respect of Development Area falling 
within the Contract Area (prior to any relinquishments), Contract Expenses in other 
Licence Area or Block(s) within the Contract Area (prior to any relinquishments) may only 
be recoverable from petroleum revenues from such Development area to the extent that 
were incurred prior to commencement of Petroleum production from such Development 
Area. 

 

(b) Royalty as provided for in Article 14(c) shall be charged first on total production from the 
Contract Area. The Royalty shall be reckoned at the well head before recovery of costs. 

 




(c) Subject to sub-article (b) and (e) of this Article and sub-article (a) of Article 13, all 
Contract Expenses incurred by the Contractor and, where Joint Operations have been 
established by TPDC shall be recovered from a volume of Crude Oil“ and/or “Natural Gas” 
or “Gas” (hereinafter referred to as “Cost Oil” and/or “Cost Gas”) produced and saved 
from the Contract Area and limited in any Calendar Year to an amount not exceeding fifty 
per cent (50%) of remaining total Crude Oil /Natural Gas production from the Contract 
Area in the onshore/shelf areas 

 

(d) Contract Expenses which, pursuant to the provision of Annex D, may be recovered from 
Cost Oil and/or Cost Gas are hereinafter referred to as “Recoverable Contract Expenses”. 
Such expenses may be recovered as from the date they have been incurred. To the extent 
that, in any Calendar Year, the Recoverable Contract Expenses exceed the Cost Oil and/or 
Cost Gas available under Article 11 (c), the un-recovered excess shall be carried forward 
for recovery in the next succeeding Calendar Year and, to the extent not then recovered, in 
the subsequent Year or Years. 

  

(e) Where, additionally, Joint Operations have been established: 

 

(i) No Contract Expenses incurred by TPDC shall be recovered from the Cost Oil 
and/or Cost Gas unless there is production from a Development Area in respect 
of which there are Joint Operations; 

(ii) The available Cost Oil and/or Cost Gas shall be applied first to recover Operating 
Expenses, and the Contractor and TPDC shall be entitled to recover such Expenses 
in proportion to their individual cumulative un-recovered Operating Expenses. After 
recovery of Operating Expenses any excess Cost Oil and/or Cost Gas available for 
distribution shall be applied to recover Exploration Expenses. After recovery of 
Operating Expenses and Exploration Expenses any excess Cost Oil and/or Cost Gas 
available for distribution shall be applied, and the Contractor and TPDC shall be 
entitled to recover such expenses in proportion to their individual cumulative un- 
recovered Development Expenses. Any un-recovered Contract Expenses shall be 
recovered out of the Cost Oil and/or Cost Gas available in the next succeeding 
Calendar Year or Years in the same manner as set out herein. 

 

(f) Subject to the limitations set out in sub-article (c) of this Article, the quantity of Cost Oil 
and/or Cost Gas which the Contractor and, if Joint Operations have been established, TPDC 



actually require and shall be entitled to in any Calendar Year will be established on the 
basis of the average fair market price per barrel determined in accordance with Article 12 
herein. 

 

(g) (i)(a) Profit Oil: For the purpose of sharing profit oil/gas between the Contractor and 

TPDC, the balance of Crude Oil available in any Year after Recoverable Contract 
Expenses have been recovered to the extent and in the manner aforesaid (hereinafter 
referred to as “Profit Oil /Gas”), total Crude Oil/Natural Gas production from the 
Contract Area shall be divided based on the following tranches: 

 

Tranches of daily total production rates (barrels of oil per day, BOPD) in the 
Contract Area in the onshore and shelf areas 

 

 0- 12,499 

 12,500- 24,999 

 25,000- 49,999 

 50,000- 99,999 

 100,000 and above 

 

(i)(b) Profit Gas: For the purpose of sharing profit gas between the Contractor and TPDC, 

the balance of Natural Gas available in any Year after Recoverable Contract 
Expenses have been recovered to the extent and in the manner aforesaid (hereinafter 
referred to as “Profit Gas”), total Natural Gas production from the Contract Area 
shall be divided based on the following tranches: 

 

Tranches of daily total production rates (million standard cubic feet of gas per day, 
MMSCFGPD) in the Contract Area in the onshore and shelf areas 
 
 

 0 - 19.99 

 20 - 39.99 

 40 - 59.99 

 60 - 79.99 

80 99.99 

100 and above 

 

 

(ii) The tranches of daily total production referred to in this Article 11 and also in 
Article 9 herein shall be specified in terms of average daily total production rates. 
The average daily production rates shall be determined for each Calendar Quarter 
and shall be calculated by dividing the total quantity of Crude Oil and/or Cost Gas 
produced and saved from the Contract Area during any Quarter by the total number 
of days during which Crude Oil and/or Cost Gas was produced in such Quarter. 

(iii) The quantity of Cost Oil and/or Cost Gas required to satisfy Recoverable Contract 
Expenses in any Year shall be allocated to each of the applicable tranches of daily 
total production in the same proportion as the total production in each tranche of 
daily total production bears to total production from the Contract Area. 

 

(h) (i) If there are no Joint Operations, after allocation of Recoverable Contract Expenses 
in accordance with sub-article (f) (iii) of this Article, the resulting Profit Oil in each 
tranche of daily total production shall be shared as follows: 



 

 

Tranches of daily total Production TPDC Share ABC Share Contractor 
(BOPD) rates in the of Profit Oil of Profit Oil 
Contract Area 

 

 0-12,499 70% 30%

(i) If there are Joint Operations in all Development Areas, TPDC’s share of Profit Oil/Gas 
indicated in sub-article (h) of this Article relative to each tranche of daily total production 
shall be increased by the number of percentage points obtained by multiplying TPDC’s 
working interest of not less than twenty five (25%) per cent in accordance with Article 9 (b) 
by the share of the Contractor’s Profit Oil/Gas indicated in sub-article (h) (i) and (ii) 
respectively of this Article relative to such increment of Profit Oil/Gas, and the 
Contractor’s share shall be reduced accordingly. However, where TPDC has elected 
pursuant to Article 9 (b) not to participate in Joint Operations in all Development Areas, the 
increase in TPDC’s share of Profit Oil/Gas shall be the result of the above calculation 
multiplied by the ratio of total production from Joint Operations over total production in the 
Contract Area during each Year. 

 

(j) With respect to this Article 11, Cost Oil and/or Cost Gas and Profit Oil and/or Profit Gas 
calculations shall be done for each Calendar Quarter and the Crude Oil/Natural Gas 
provisionally shared accordingly. To the extent that actual quantities, expenses and prices 
are not known, provisional estimates of such data based on the approved Work Program, 
budget and any other relevant documentation or information shall be used. Within sixty 
(60) days of the end of each Calendar Year a final calculation of Cost Oil and/or Cost Gas 
and Profit Oil and/or Profit Gas based on actual Crude Oil/Natural Gas quantities, prices 
and recoverable costs and expenses in respect of that Calendar Year shall be prepared and 
any necessary adjustments to the Crude Oil/Natural Gas sharing shall be agreed upon 
between the Contractor and TPDC and made as soon as is practicable. 

 



(k) Subject to Article 17(d), the Contractor will be free to export any Petroleum received by 
Contractor pursuant to Article 11 and 13 of this Agreement and to retain the proceeds of the 
sale of such Petroleum outside the United Republic of Tanzania. 

 



ARTICLE 12: VALUATION OF CRUDE OIL 

 

(a) The parties hereby agree that Tanzanian Crude Oil produced and saved from the Contract 
Area shall be sold or otherwise disposed of at competitive international market prices. The 
average fair market price of Tanzanian Crude Oil marketed in any Calendar Quarter shall, 
for the purpose of giving effect to this Agreement, be determined as follows: 

 

(1) as soon as possible after the end of each Calendar Quarter in which Crude Oil has 
been produced from any Development Area pursuant to this Agreement an average 
price (in terms of US$ per barrel FOB the Contractor’s actual loading point for 
export from the United Republic of Tanzania) for each separate volume of Crude 
Oil of the same gravity, sulphur and metal content, pour point, product yield and 
other relevant characteristics (“quality”) shall be determined in respect of 
production during that Calendar Quarter. It is understood that production from 
different Development Areas may be of differing quality and that separate average 
prices may accordingly be appropriate for any Calendar Quarter in respect of 
production for each Area, in which event the overall price applicable to production 
from the Contract Area shall be determined by taking the arithmetic weighted 
average (weighted by volume) of all such prices separately determined; 

 

(2) the prices aforesaid shall be determined on the basis of international fair market 
value as follows: 

 

(i) in the event that 50% or more of the total volume of sales made by the 
Contractor during the Calendar Quarter of Crude Oil of a given quality 
produced and saved hereunder have been third party arms length sales 
transacted in foreign exchange (hereinafter referred to as “Third Party 
Sales”), the fair market valuation for all Crude Oil of that quality will be 
taken to be the simple arithmetic average price actually realized in such 
Third Party Sales. This will be calculated by dividing the total receipts from 
all Third Party Sales by the total number of Barrels of Crude Oil sold in such 
sales; 

(ii) subject to sub-paragraph (3) below, in the event that less than 50% of the 
total volume of sales made by the Contractor during the Calendar Quarter of 
Crude Oil of a given quality produced and saved hereunder have been Third 
Party Sales, the fair market valuation for all Crude Oil of that quality will be 
determined by the arithmetic weighted average of: 

 

(A) the simple arithmetic average price actually realized in the Third Party 
Sales during the Calendar Quarter of such Crude Oil produced and 
saved hereunder, if any, calculated by dividing the total receipts from 
all Third Party Sales by the total number of Barrels of Crude Oil sold 
in such sales; 

 

and 

 

(B) the simple arithmetic average price per Barrel at which a selection of 
major competitive crude oils of generally similar quality to that of 
Tanzanian Crude Oil produced hereunder and crude of sufficient 
liquidity daily traded in sufficient quantities (above 0.1 million barrels 



a day) which are listed and published in Platt Oilgram) were sold in 
international markets during the same period; the prices of the crude 
oils used for reference will be adjusted for differences in quality, 
quantity, transportation costs, delivery time, payment and other 
contract terms. 

 

The selected crude oils will be agreed between the Contractor and 
TPDC, in consultation with the Government in advance for each 
Calendar year and in making the selection preference will be given to 
those crude oils of similar quality to Tanzanian Crude Oil which are 
produced in Africa or the Middle East and are regularly sold in the 
same markets as Tanzanian Crude Oil is normally sold. 

 

The arithmetic weighted average aforesaid will be determined by the 
percentage volume of sales of Tanzanian Crude Oil by Contractor that 
are, (A), and that are not, (B) as the case may be, Third Party Sales 
during the Calendar Quarter in question. 

 

(iii) all such prices will be adjusted to FOB the Contractor’s actual loading point 
for export from the United Republic of Tanzania; 

(iv) for the purposes of this Article, Third Party Sales of Crude Oil made by the 
Contractor shall include any third party arms length sales made by the 
Contractor on Government’s behalf pursuant to Article 17 herein but shall 
exclude: 

 

(A) Sales, whether direct or indirect through brokers or otherwise, of 
any seller to any Affiliate of such seller. 

 

(B) Crude Oil exchanges, barter deals or restricted or distress 
transactions, and more generally any Crude Oil transaction which is 
motivated in whole or in part by considerations other than the usual 
economic incentives for commercial arms length crude oil sales. 
 
 

(3) In the event that less than 50% of the total volume of sales by the Contractor during 
the Calendar Quarter of Crude Oil/Natural Gas of a given quality produced and 
saved hereunder have been Third Party Sales, the Contractor shall promptly notify 
Government and TPDC of the applicable percentage and respective volumes and 
prices realized. Government and TPDC shall have the right to elect for the fair 
market valuation for all Crude Oil/Natural Gas of that quality to be determined for 
that Quarter in accordance with sub-article 12 (a) 2 (i) of this Article. If Government 
and TPDC so elect, they will notify the Contractor in writing within 14 days of 
receipt of the original notification from the Contractor, and the fair market valuation 
of the aforesaid Crude Oil shall be determined accordingly. If Government and 
TPDC do not so elect then the fair market valuation shall be determined in 
accordance with sub-article 12(a) (2) (ii) of this Article. 

 

(b) The Contractor shall be responsible for establishing the relevant average prices for Crude 
Oil in accordance with this Article 12, and such prices shall be subject to agreement by 
TPDC before they shall be accepted as having been finally determined. The Contractor 
shall provide TPDC with all relevant material in order that it can satisfy itself that the 



average price determined by the Contractor is fair. If the parties fail to agree on the average 
price for any Calendar Quarter within thirty (30) days following the end of such Quarter 
then the calculation of the relevant average price shall be referred to a sole expert appointed 
pursuant to sub-article (d) of this Article. The sole expert’s determination shall be final and 
binding. 

 

(c) During the Calendar year in which production from the Contract Area commences, the 
parties will meet in order to establish a provisional selection of the major competitive crude 
oils and an appropriate mechanism for the purposes of giving effect to sub-article 12(a) 
(2)(ii) (B) of this Article. The selection of crude oils will be reviewed annually and 
modified if necessary. 

 

(d) In the event of any difference or dispute between the Contractor and Government or TPDC 
concerning selection of the major competitive crude oils, or more generally about the 
manner in which the prices are determined according to the provisions of this Article 12, 
the matter or matters in issue shall finally be resolved by a sole expert appointed by 
agreement between the parties or, in the absence of such agreement, by the British Energy 
Institute (formerly British Institute of Petroleum). The costs of the expert shall be shared 
equally between the Contractor on the one hand and the Government and TPDC on the 
other hand. 



ARTICLE 13: NATURAL GAS 

 

(a) Where Contractor has informed TPDC that Non-Associated Natural Gas discovered in the 
Contract Area is of potential commercial interest, the Contractor shall, as soon as possible 
but in any case not exceeding thirty days (30) submit to TPDC, for the consideration of the 
Advisory Committee, its proposals for an appraisal programme to meet the requirements of 
Section 32 (2) of the Act. After completion by the Contractor of an appraisal program, the 
parties shall meet together with a view to reaching an agreement on the development, 
production, processing and sale of such gas. 

 

For the purpose of the aforesaid, the parties undertake to negotiate in good faith and in 
doing so will seek to give effect to the following principles: 

 

(i) all Contract Expenses directly attributed to the discovery and production of such gas 
shall be recovered from part thereof and the remainder of the gas shared between the 
Contractor and TPDC as far as possible in accordance with the scheme for cost 
recovery and sharing of Profit Oil/Gas set out in Article 11; and 

(ii) to the extent that market conditions permit, gas will be valued for cost recovery and 
sold for processing or export at prices which will give to the Contractor a fair return 
on its investment. 

 

(b) Where:- 

(i) Non-Associated Natural Gas has been discovered in the Contract Area, and 

(ii) a Location has been declared in respect of a Block or Blocks in which such 
discovery is located, and 

(iii) the parties agree that the Non-Associated Gas discovered by the Contractor exists 
in the Contract Area in quantities sufficient to justify consideration of an export 
scheme, 

 

the Minister will, if TPDC at the request of the Contractor applies in that behalf, extend for 
a reasonable time, not to exceed three (3) years, the period within which TPDC may apply 
for a Development Licence over a Block or Blocks within that Location. 

 

(c) Subject to the provisions of the Act, Natural Gas associated with Crude Oil and not used in 
Petroleum Operations may be flared only if the use thereof is uneconomic. However, TPDC 
may elect to offtake, free of charge, at the wellhead or gas oil separator and use for 
domestic requirements such Natural Gas that would otherwise be flared, provided that all 
costs associated with TPDC’s utilization of the Natural Gas be borne by TPDC. It is 
understood that such offtake should not be detrimental to the prompt conduct of oil field 
operations according to Good Oilfield Practices. 

. 



ARTICLE 14: TAXATION AND ROYALTY 

 

(a) The Contractor shall be subject to Tanzanian taxes on income derived from Petroleum 
Operations hereunder, as provided for under the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 2004. 

 

(b) In addition to taxes paid in accordance with sub-article (a) above the Contractor or its

(iv) stamp duties, registration fees, licence fees and any other tax, duty, fee or other 
impost of a minor nature. 

 

(c) TPDC on behalf of itself and the Contractor shall discharge the obligation to pay Royalty 
under Section 81 of the Act in respect of petroleum obtained from the Contract Area, by 
delivering to the Government 12.5% of total Crude Oil/Natural Gas production (prior to 
Cost Oil and/or Cost Gas recovery) at such location as the Minister may direct and the 
Government may require TPDC to dispose of such royalty otherwise to be delivered to the 
Government in such manner as the Government may direct. 



 

ARTICLE 15: ADDITIONAL PROFITS TAX 

 

(a) Contractor shall be subject to an Additional Profits Tax (hereinafter referred to as "APT") 
that shall be calculated on a Development Area basis in accordance with the provisions of 
this Article 16. APT will be calculated for each Calendar Year and will vary with the real 
rate of return earned by Contractor on the net cash flow from the Development Area in 
question. If, for any Development Area, either: 

 

(i) the "first accumulated net cash position" (as calculated in the manner set out 
hereafter and a sample calculation methodology shown in Annex "E" and 
hereinafter referred to as the "FANCP"); 

or 

 

(ii) each of the FANCP and the "second accumulated net cash position" (as calculated 
in the manner set out hereafter and a sample hereinafter and referred to as the 
"SANCP") 




 

is a positive amount, then the APT from the Development Area in question for any 
Calendar Year shall be either, in case (i): twenty five percent (25%) of the FANCP for that 
Year, or in case (ii): the aggregate of twenty five percent (25%) of the FANCP for that 
Year and thirty five percent (35%) of the SANCP for that Year. If in any Year the FANCP 
or the SANCP is a negative amount then no APT shall be due with reference to that 
FANCP or SANCP. 

 

(b) The FANCP on any Development Area for any Calendar Year shall be calculated 
according to the following formula: 

  

 FANCP = A(100%+B)+C where: 

 

"A" equals the FANCP denominated in US dollars at the end of the Calendar Year 
preceding the Calendar Year for which the calculation is being made 

 

"B" equals twenty percent (20%) plus the percentage change, for the Calendar Year for 
which the calculation is being made, in the annual average level of the United 
Stated Industrial Goods Producer Price Index (USIGPPI) as reported for the first 
time in the monthly publication "International Financial Statistics" of the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the section "Prices, Production, 
Employment". 

 

"C" equals the net cash position denominated in US dollars (which may be a positive or 
negative amount) for the Calendar Year for which the calculation is being made, 
calculated as follows: 

 

(i) Contractor's share of Cost Oil and Profit Oil for that Calendar Year valued in 
accordance with Article 13 hereof and allocated to the Development Area in 
question in accordance with the provisions of Annex " D" to this Agreement 

. 

 

 



plus 

 

(ii) Contractor's share of all credits to the accounts under this Agreement in respect of 
the Calendar Year, calculated and allocated to the Development Area in question in 
accordance with the provisions of Annex “D" to this Agreement 




 

minus 

 

(iii) Contractor's share of all charges to the accounts under this Agreement in respect of 
that Calendar Year, calculated and allocated to the Development Area in question in 
accordance with the provisions of Annex "D" to this Agreement, except that for this 
purpose Contractor's share of charges shall not include any amounts in respect of 
interest on loans obtained for the purpose of carrying out Petroleum Operations. 

 

(c) The SANCP on any Development Area for any Calendar Year shall be calculated 
according to the same formula given under sub-article (b) above except that: 

 

"A" equals the SANCP denominated in US dollars at the end of the Calendar Year 
preceding the Calendar Year for which the calculation is being made, 

"B" equals thirty percent (30%) plus the percentage change, for the Calendar Year for 
which the calculation is being made, in the annual average level the USIGPPI as 
reported for the first time in the monthly publication "International Financial 
Statistics" of the IMF in the section "Prices, Production, Employment". 

 

To the amount calculated under (iii) in the definition of "C" is sub-article (b) above shall be 
added any Additional Profits Tax which would be payable from the Development Area if 
reference were made hereunder only to the FANCP. 
 
 

(d) If for any Calendar Year the FANCP is positive amount, the FANCP at the end of that 
Calendar year shall be deemed to be zero for the purpose of calculating the FANCP for the 
subsequent Calendar Year. 

 

(e) If for any Calendar Year the SANCP is a positive amount, the SANCP at the end of that 
Calendar Year shall be deemed to be zero for the purpose of calculating the SANCP for the 
subsequent Calendar Year. 

 

(f) Contractor shall maintain proper records and books of accounts in accordance with the 
provisions of Annex "D" enabling the calculations described in this Article 16 to be 
performed. From the Effective Date Contractor shall maintain and submit to the 
Government annually, or more frequently if so requested, a statement of the FANCP and 
SANCP. 

 

(g) The APT due, if any, shall be paid in cash at such time and in such manner as the 
Commissioner of Income Tax may reasonably require.

(a) In furtherance of the Regulations made under the Act or as the Government may otherwise 
require from time to time, the Contractor shall take necessary and adequate steps to: 

 

(i) conduct its Petroleum Operations in a manner that will protect the natural resources, 
including the living resources of the land, sea and lakes of the United Republic of 
Tanzania and the environment;

property caused by the effects of Petroleum Operations. 

 

(b) If Contractor’s failure to comply with the provisions of sub-article (a) (i) of this Article and 
the Regulations results in pollution or damage to the environment or marine life or 
otherwise, the Contractor shall take all necessary measures to remedy the failure and effects 
thereof. If such pollution or damage is the result of gross negligence or willful misconduct 
of the Contractor, the cost of the remedy shall not be a Recoverable Contract Expense for 
the purpose of Article 11 and Annex “D”. 

 

(c) The Contractor shall notify the Minister and TPDC forthwith in the event of any 
emergency or accident affecting the environment and shall take such action as may be 
prudent and necessary in accordance with good international petroleum industry practice in 
such circumstances. The costs of such action shall be recoverable costs provided that if 
such emergency or accident is the result of Gross Negligence or Willful Misconduct of 
Contractor, the cost of the action shall not be a Recoverable Contract Expense for the 
purpose of Article 11 and Annex “D”. 

 

(d) If the Contractor does not act promptly so as to control or clean up any pollution or 
make good any damage caused, TPDC may, after giving the Contractor reasonable notice 
in the circumstances, take any actions which are necessary in accordance with good 
international petroleum industry practice, and the reasonable costs and expenses of such 
actions shall be borne by the Contractor. 

 

(e) The Contractor should undertake at its expense (but as a legitimate recoverable cost) one or 
more comprehensive Environmental Impact Assessment studies prior to, during and after 
any major Petroleum Operations. This requirement is mandatory, and the first study shall

Party, capable of being resolved in a manner not contrary to such Party’s commercial 
interests. 




(b) Force Majeure Events shall expressly not include the following conditions, except and to 
the extent that they result directly from force majeure: a delay in the performance of any 
contractor, including late delivery of machinery or materials; and normal wear and tear.

 So long as the affected Party has at all times since the occurrence of the Force Majeure 
Event complied with the obligations of this Article and continues to so comply then: (i) 
the affected Party shall not be liable for any failure or delay in performing its 
obligations (other than the obligation to make any payment otherwise due hereunder) 
under or pursuant to this Agreement for so long as and to the extent that the 
performance of such obligations are affected by the Force Majeure Event; and (ii) any 
performance deadline that the affected Party is obligated to meet under this Agreement 
shall be extended; provided, however, that no relief, including the extension of
