CONSIDERATION
4.1 Minimum Work Program Commitment and Maximum Carry Amount
As Consideration for the transfer of the Participating Interest hereunder, Farmee agrees to perform or cause to be performed the following obligations:
A. Farmee agrees to pay Farmor the amount of US$8,000,000.00 in cash, representing payment for a portion of Farmor’s exploration costs incurred prior to the date hereof, no later than ten (10) days following satisfaction or waiver of the Farm-In Conditions (the “Initial Payment”). The Parties agree and acknowledge that Farmor’s total exploration costs to date are approximately US$11,000,000.00, so that an estimated US$3,000,000.00 in exploration costs will remain outstanding and be recoverable by Farmor in accordance with the Contract. Such remaining sunk costs of Farmor shall be reimbursed on a pro-rata basis after approval of any Overall Development Program and reimbursement of any higher priority costs and expenses as required in accordance with the Contract.
B. As partial consideration for the Assignment to be made under this Agreement, Farmor’s retained Participating Interest shall be a carried interest for which Farmee shall be wholly responsible to fund all costs until Farmee has spent an aggregate of US $30,000,000.00 (the “Maximum Carry Amount”) on Exploration Operations or until the commencement of Development Operations, whichever occurs earlier; provided, however, Farmee shall continue to carry Farmor’s retained Participating Interest with respect to any areas inside the Contract Area which are outside of the areas covered by one or more approved Overall Development Programs up to the Maximum Carry Amount in aggregate. Farmor hereby agrees and acknowledges that any decision to spend amounts exceeding the Minimum Work Commitment amounts and up to the Maximum Carry Amount shall be in Farmee’s sole discretion, subject to any AFE procedures that may be agreed upon in the JOA. For the avoidance of doubt, Farmee’s expenditure of any amounts up to the Maximum Carry Amount shall not dilute Farmor’s Participating Interest in the Contract.
C. Farmee agrees that it shall expend a minimum of US $6,000,000.00 in qualified Exploration Operations for the 2009 calendar year (the “2009 Minimum Work Commitment”), which expenditures shall be credited against the Maximum Carry Amount. Farmee agrees to spend in excess of the 2009 Minimum Work Commitment if necessary to obtain an extension of the Exploration Period under the Contract in satisfaction of one of the Farm-In Conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Farmee’s obligation to pay the 2009 Minimum Work Commitment exceed US $8,000,000.00, unless Farmee otherwise agrees in writing. The Parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to submit a Work Program for 2009 that includes the matters set forth on Exhibit G attached hereto, it being understood that the final 2009 Work Program is subject to CUCBM approval.
 
8 of 27
D. If the Parties mutually agree to proceed with a request to extend Exploration Operations for the 2010 calendar year or they submit an Overall Development Program application for a portion for the Contract Area, then, subject to Government approval of the 2010 Work Program, Farmee agrees that it shall expend a minimum of US $12,000,000.00 in qualified Exploration Operations for the 2010 calendar year (the “2010 Minimum Work Commitment”), which expenditures shall be credited against the Maximum Carry Amount; provided, however, if Farmor is required to submit a budget exceeding the 2009 Minimum Work Commitment amount in order to satisfy the Farm-In Condition in Article 3.1.E, then the 2010 Minimum Work Commitment shall be reduced on a dollar for dollar basis for every amount over US $6,000,000.00 stated in the budget and expended in 2009 by Farmee. In addition to the foregoing, Farmor in its discretion may agree to a reduction of the 2010 Minimum Work Commitment as it deems reasonably appropriate.
E. Subject to Farmor’s Opt Out Options, upon Farmee’s total aggregate expenditure of the Maximum Carry Amount, the Parties shall bear further expenditures equally in proportion to their Participating Interest share.
F. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Farmee’s obligation to carry Farmor’s Participating Interest share of costs to complete the Work Program for the 2010 calendar year is conditioned upon the satisfaction of all of the following:
(i) Completion of the Work Program for 2009 to Farmee’s reasonable satisfaction;
(ii) The Parties’ joint development of the Work Program for the 2010 calendar year and submission to the Joint Management Committee for approval, in accordance with the Contract; and
(iii) The Parties’ joint submission to the Government of a request for extension of the Exploration Period, for an additional period of at least one (1) year from expiration of the original Exploration Period, and the approval thereof.
G. Notwithstanding Farmee’s obligation to carry Farmor up to the Maximum Carry Amount, Farmor agrees to pay the costs associated with the contract to drill FCC-QN 02H well in effect as of the date this Agreement is executed. Such costs shall be recoverable by Farmor pursuant to the terms of the Contract, in addition to its other sunk costs which are not reimbursed by Farmee in accordance herewith.
4.2 Sunk Cost Reimbursement
To the extent not already paid by Farmee, within ten (10) days following satisfaction of the Farm-In Conditions and Farmor’s submission of a written invoice together with reasonable supporting documentation indicting the amount due, Farmee shall reimburse Farmor for all monies spent on Coalbed Methane Operations during the Interim Period (“Sunk Cost Reimbursement”). Payment of the Sunk Cost Reimbursement to Farmor shall be credited against the Maximum Carry Amount and the 2009 Minimum Work Commitment as defined in Article 4.1.C.
 
9 of 27
4.3 Contract Expense Reimbursement
Subject to the satisfaction of the Farm-In Conditions, from the Effective Date, Farmee shall be responsible for paying one hundred percent (100%) of the costs under the Contract payable to the (i) Government, (ii) CUCBM, or its successors or assigns, or (iii) in connection with the Joint Management Committee salary fees, training fees, exploration fees, and assistance fees as outlined in the Contract (“Contract Expenses”); provided, however, Farmee shall only be responsible for Contract Expenses up to the maximum sum of US$1,000,000. To the extent not already paid by Farmee, within ten (10) days following satisfaction of the Farm-In Conditions and Farmor’s submission of a written invoice together with reasonable supporting documentation indicting the amount due, Farmee shall reimburse Farmor for Contract Expenses paid during the Interim Period. Payment of Contract Expenses to Farmor shall be credited against the Maximum Carry Amount and the 2009 Minimum Work Commitment as defined in Article 4.1.C.
4.4 Future Cash Calls
After Farmee has performed its obligations described in Article 4.1 and satisfied the Maximum Carry Amount, Farmee agrees to pay its Participating Interest share of costs incurred under the Contract and the JOA, together with its Participating Interest portion (if applicable) of the ORRI and Phillips ORRI.
4.5 Overall Development Program Bonus
In addition to those amounts to be paid or obligations to be fulfilled by Farmee hereunder, Farmee shall pay Farmor a bonus equal to US $8,000,000.00 immediately upon Government approval of an Overall Development Program in accordance with the Contract (the “ODP Bonus”).
4.6 Payment Terms
Payment of all amounts specified in this Article 4 shall be made in immediately available funds by wire transfer into a bank account designated in writing by Farmor.
4.7 Opt Out Option
A. If at any time during the performance of the Exploration Operations, expenditures exceeding the Maximum Carry Amount are required, Farmor shall have the option, which option shall be exercised no later than ten (10) days prior to the anticipated expenditure of the Maximum Carry Amount, to elect to either retain its Participating Interest in the Contract, or to assign one hundred percent (100%) of its Participating Interest to Farmee and retain a two percent (2%) overriding royalty interest (“ORRI”) in production in the Qinnan block. For purposes of clarification, the ORRI shall be equal to two percent (2%) of all gross revenues from the Qinnan block after reasonable and necessary cost recovery payments have been made. If
 
10 of 27
CUCBM, or its successor CNPC, elects to participate at a level less than a net undivided thirty percent (30%) Participating Interest, or not to participate in the development of a CBM Field at all, Farmor’s ORRI shall remain at two percent (2%) of Farmee’s Participating Interest share in the Contract. After exercising its opt out rights hereunder, Farmor shall have no responsibility or liability to fund any exploration or development costs.
B. Upon the approval of an Overall Development Program, Farmor shall have the option, which option shall be exercised no later than sixty (60) days following notification to the Parties of Government approval of an Overall Development Program to elect either to retain its Participating Interest in the Contract, or to assign one hundred percent (100%) of its Participating Interest to Farmee and retain a five percent (5%) ORRI in production from the Qinnan block. For purposes of clarification, the ORRI shall be equal to five percent (5%) of all gross revenues from the Qinnan block after reasonable and necessary cost recovery payments have been made. If CUCBM, or its successor CNPC, elects to participate at a level less than a net undivided thirty percent (30%) Participating Interest, or not to participate in the development of a CBM Field at all, Farmor’s ORRI shall remain at five percent (5%). After exercising its opt out rights hereunder, Farmor shall have no responsibility or liability to fund any exploration or development costs in respect of periods after it exercises those rights.

The Parties agree that Farmor shall retain at least one position on the Joint Management Committee; provided, however, if such appointment would exclude the ability for Farmee’s 75.25% Participating Interest to have at least one position on the Joint Management Committee, then the Parties agree to expand the size of the committee in accordance with Section 7.1.1 of the Contract as necessary to ensure that Farmee’s 75.25% Participating Interest and Farmor’s 24.75% Participating Interest each have the right to appoint at least one representative to the Joint Management Committee.
C. Whenever possible, the Parties shall agree in advance upon proposals to be submitted to the Joint Management Committee in accordance with the JOA to ensure a consistent approach and appearance to matters to be considered thereunder. Nothing in the Contract shall entitle one Party or the other to a casting vote or similar right that would usurp the approval and decision making process agreed upon in the JOA with respect to the Parties.
D. If CUCBM, or its successor in interest, exercises its right to participate pursuant to Article 2.4 of the Contract in the development of a CBM Field, such entity shall bear its portion of such development and operating costs in accordance with the Contract. For purposes of clarification, if CUCBM exercises its right to participate in an undivided 10% Participating Interest of a CBM Field development, then Farmee shall be responsible for 67.725% (75.25% of the remaining 90%) of development and operating costs and Farmor shall be responsible for 22.23% (24.75% of the remaining 90%) of development and operating costs for such field.

16 of 27
6.4 Disclaimer of Other Representations and Warranties
EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES PROVIDED IN THIS ARTICLE, FARMOR AND FARMEE MAKE NO, AND DISCLAIM ANY, WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY DATA, REPORTS, RECORDS, PROJECTIONS, INFORMATION, OR MATERIALS NOW, HERETOFORE, OR HEREAFTER FURNISHED OR MADE AVAILABLE TO FARMEE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT.
ARTICLE 7
TAXES
7.1 Tax Obligations
Each Party shall be responsible for reporting and discharging its own tax measured by the profit or income of the Party and the satisfaction of such Party’s share of all contract obligations under the Contract and under this Agreement. Each Party shall protect, defend and indemnify each other Party from any and all loss, cost or liability arising from the indemnifying Party’s failure to report and discharge such taxes or satisfy such obligations. The Parties intend that all income and all tax benefits (including deductions, depreciation, credits and capitalization) with respect to the expenditures made by the Parties hereunder will be allocated by the Government tax authorities to the Parties based on the share of each tax item actually received or borne by each Party. If such allocation is not accomplished due to the application of the Laws / Regulations or other Government action, the Parties shall attempt to adopt mutually agreeable arrangements that will allow the Parties to achieve the financial results intended. Operator shall provide each Party, in a timely manner and at such Party’s sole expense, with such information with respect to Joint Operations as such Party may reasonably request for preparation of its tax returns or responding to any audit or other tax proceeding.
7.2 Joint Levy
If interpretation or enforcement of the Contract by the Government imposes joint and several liability on the Parties for any levy, charge or tax, the Parties agree to cross indemnify each other to the extent that such levy, charge or tax is owed by one Party individually.
7.3 United States Tax Election
A. If, for United States federal income tax purposes, this Agreement and the operations under this Agreement are regarded as a partnership and if the Parties have not agreed to form a tax partnership, each Party elects to be excluded from the application of all of the provisions of Subchapter “K”, Chapter 1, Subtitle “A” of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), to the extent permitted and authorized by 761(a) of the Code and the regulations promulgated under the Code. Operator, if it is a U.S. Party, is authorized and directed to execute and file for each Party such evidence of this election as may be required by the Internal Revenue Service, including all of the returns, statements, and data required by United States Treasury Regulations s 1.761-2 and 1.6031(a)-1(b)(5) and shall provide a copy thereof to each U.S. Party. However, if Operator is not a U.S. Party, Farmor, or
 
17 of 27
its designee, shall fulfill the obligations of Operator under this Article. Should there be any requirement that any Party give further evidence of this election, each Party shall execute such documents and furnish such other evidence as may be required by the Internal Revenue Service or as may be necessary to evidence this election.
B. No Party shall give any notice or take any other action inconsistent with the foregoing election. If any income tax laws of any state or other political subdivision of the United States or any future income tax laws of the United States or any such political subdivision contain provisions similar to those in Subchapter “K”, Chapter 1, Subtitle “A” of the Code, under which an election similar to that provided by 761(a) of the Code is permitted, each Party shall make such election as may be permitted or required by such laws. In making the foregoing election or elections, each U.S. Party states that the income derived by it from operations under this Agreement can be adequately determined without the computation of partnership taxable income.
C. Unless approved by every Non-U.S. Party, no activity shall be conducted under this Agreement that would cause any Non-U.S. Party to be deemed to be engaged in a trade or business within the United States under United States income tax laws and regulations.
ARTICLE 8
CONFIDENTIALITY
8.1 Except as otherwise provided in the Contract and the JOA, each Party agrees that all information disclosed under this Agreement, except information in the public domain or lawfully in possession of a Party prior to the Effective Date, shall be considered confidential and shall not be disclosed to any other person or entity without the prior written consent of the Party which owns such confidential information. This obligation of confidentiality shall remain in force during the term of the Contract and for a period of two (2) years thereafter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, confidential information may be disclosed without consent and without violating the obligations contained in this Article in the following circumstances:
A. to an Affiliate provided the Affiliate is bound to the provisions of this Article 8 and the Party disclosing is responsible for the violation of an Affiliate;

F. to a bona fide prospective transferee of a Party’s Participating Interest, or portion thereof, to the extent appropriate in order to allow the assessment of such Participating Interest (including an entity with whom a Party and/or its Affiliates are conducting bona fide negotiations directed toward a merger, consolidation or the sale of a majority of its or an Affiliate’s shares);
G. to a bank or other financial institution to the extent appropriate to a Party arranging for funding;
H. to the extent such information must be disclosed pursuant to any rules or requirements of any government or stock exchange having jurisdiction over such Party, or its Affiliates;
I. to its respective employees, subject to each Party taking sufficient precautions to ensure such information is kept confidential;
J. to the extent any information which, through no fault of a Party, becomes a part of the public domain; and
K. to the other parties to the Contract and JOA and the Government solely to the extent as may be required to satisfy the Farm-In Conditions.
8.2 Disclosure as pursuant to Articles 8.1(E), (F), (G) and (K) shall not be made unless prior to such disclosure the disclosing Party has obtained a written undertaking from the recipient Party to keep the information strictly confidential for at least as long as the period set out above and to use the information for the sole purpose described in Articles 8.1(E), (F), (G), and (K), whichever is applicable, with respect to the disclosing Party.

GOVERNING LAW, DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND LIABILITIES
10.1 Governing Law
All questions concerning the construction, validity, enforcement and interpretation of this Agreement, and all disputes and controversies arising herefrom, shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York. Each Party agrees that all actions concerning the interpretation, enforcement and defense of the transactions contemplated hereunder (whether brought against a Party or its respective Affiliates, employees or agents) may be commenced in the state and federal courts sitting in the City of New York, New York (the “New York Courts”). Each Party hereby irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the New York Courts for the adjudication of any dispute hereunder or in connection herewith or with any transaction (including with respect to the enforcement of the this Agreement), and hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert in any action, any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of any such New York Court, or that such action has been commenced in an improper or inconvenient forum. Each Party hereby irrevocably waives personal service of process and consents to process being served in any such action by mailing a copy thereof via registered or certified mail or overnight delivery (with evidence of delivery) to such Party at the address in effect for notices to it under this Agreement and agrees that such service shall constitute good and sufficient service of process and notice thereof. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to limit in any way any right to serve process in any manner permitted by law. Each Party hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereunder.
10.2 Liabilities
The liabilities of the Parties hereunder shall be several, not joint, and each Party shall be individually responsible for its respective share of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and associated legal expenses arising under this Agreement, and each Party agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other Party to the extent of its Participating Interest share, from and against any such losses, claims, liabilities and associated attorneys’ fees.
 
21 of 27
ARTICLE 11
FORCE MAJEURE
If as a result of Force Majeure, any Party is rendered unable, wholly or in part, to carry out its obligations under this Agreement, other than the obligation to pay any amounts due, then the obligations of the Party giving such notice, so far as and to the extent that the obligations are affected by such Force Majeure, shall be suspended during the continuance of any inability so caused and for such reasonable period thereafter as may be necessary for the Party to put itself in the same position that it occupied prior to the Force Majeure, but for no longer period. The Party claiming Force Majeure shall notify the other Parties of the Force Majeure within a reasonable time after the occurrence of the facts relied on and shall keep all Parties informed of all significant developments. Such notice shall give reasonably full particulars of the Force Majeure and also estimate the period of time which the Party will probably require to remedy the Force Majeure. The affected Party shall use all reasonable diligence to remove or overcome the Force Majeure situation as quickly as possible in a commercially reasonable manner but shall not be obligated to settle any labor dispute except on terms acceptable to it. All such disputes shall be handled within the sole discretion of the affected Party.
ARTICLE 12
DEFAULT
12.1 Default
A. Should a Party be in default of any of its obligations under this Agreement, the non-defaulting Party shall so notify the defaulting Party in writing specifying in sufficient detail the nature and extent of such default. If the defaulting Party fails to cure such default as soon as is reasonably possible, and in any event within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice (ten (10) days for a payment default), the non-defaulting Party shall have such remedies to which it may be entitled at law for breach of contract or in equity, including any rights to suspend, terminate or demand payments in connection herewith.
B. Any Farmee payment defaults shall accrue interest at the lower of the rate of 16% per annum or the maximum allowable interest rate under applicable law, calculated from the due date until the date of payment. Such default interest shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months for the actual number of days elapsed.
12.2 Reassignment Option
A. If a Reassignment Event occurs, then Farmor may at its option, either elect to pursue such remedies to which it may be entitled at law or equity as a result of such event, or it may elect to immediately terminate this Agreement and proceed with the Reassignment (defined below). Upon the occurrence of a Reassignment Event, Farmor shall have the exclusive right on Farmee’s behalf to have reassigned the Participating Interest and any other rights conveyed under this Agreement from Farmee to Farmor or a third party, effective retroactively to the Effective Date of this Agreement without reimbursement of any of Farmee’s expenditures or costs, on the basis of the terms in Article 12.2.B and schedule 1 (the “Reassignment”). Farmor must obtain at its cost any requisite approvals to the Reassignment.
 
22 of 27
B. The Reassignment shall be accomplished by (i) Farmee signing and delivering to Farmor at Farmor’s request or (ii) Farmor signing and delivering on behalf of Farmee in accordance with the Power of Attorney, an assignment in the form and substance as set out in Schedule 1, which contains, among other provisions, a relinquishment of operatorship under the Contract (and JOA if applicable) to Farmor and a relinquishment of any right, title or interest in any Participating Interest.
C. It is the intent of the Parties that if Reassignment occurs, this Agreement and any JOA shall be void and shall have no force or effect and Farmee shall have no interest whatsoever in the Contract and shall be deemed to have reassigned any rights or equitable interest it may have acquired under this Agreement to Farmor retroactive to the Effective Date of this Agreement, provided, however, the Parties shall continue to comply with the confidentiality requirements set forth in Article 8.
D. The Parties agree and acknowledge that the Reassignment option is an integral part of the Consideration to Farmor under this Agreement and that such option is not a penalty, but rather a reasonable remedy in light of the limited exposure of Farmee at the time such remedy can be invoked, the potential risks and substantial losses to be incurred by Farmor upon the occurrence of a Reassignment Event, and Farmor’s need to promptly pursue other options with respect to its Participating Interest and preserve rights under the Contract.
12.3 Other Termination Rights
A. Any period of Force Majeure under Article 11 notwithstanding, if the Farm-In Conditions are not satisfied on or before the Farm-In Deadline, then either Party has the right to terminate this Agreement by giving notice to the other Party in accordance with the provisions of Article 11; provided, however, if the Farm-In Conditions were not satisfied as a result of a Party’s breach of its contractual obligations to the other Party, then such defaulting Party shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with this Article.
B. If the Government rejects the Assignment, or if it elects to exercise its right of pre-emption under Article 22.2 of the Contract, then this Agreement shall automatically terminate upon the earlier of (i) the closing on such Government acquisition or (ii) thirty (30) days from the Parties’ receipt of such notification from the Government.
C. In the event of termination pursuant to this Article 12.3, the proposed Assignment shall terminate, shall be rendered void and shall have no force or effect and Farmee shall have no interest whatsoever in the Contract and shall be deemed to have reassigned any rights or equitable interest it may have acquired under this Agreement to Farmor retroactive to the Effective Date of this Agreement. Upon such termination, neither Party shall have any further obligations to the other (including but not limited to payment obligations) except for those that accrued prior to the actual date of such termination; provided, however, the Parties shall continue to comply with the confidentiality requirements set forth in Article 8.

13.4 Joint Preparation
Each provision of this Agreement shall be construed as though all Parties participated equally in the drafting of the same.

13.5 Severance of Invalid Provisions
If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect for so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereunder is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

13.10 Counterpart Execution
This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which when taken together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each Party and delivered to the other Parties, it being understood that all Parties need not sign the same counterpart. In the event that any signature is delivered by facsimile transmission or by electronic mail in Portable Document Format, such signature shall create a valid and binding obligation of the person executing (or on whose behalf such signature is executed) with the same force and effect as if such facsimile signature page were an original thereof.
 
25 of 27
13.11 Public Announcements
No public announcement or statement regarding the terms or existence or this Agreement shall be made without prior written consent of all Parties; provided, however, that, notwithstanding any failure to obtain such approval, no Party or its Affiliates shall be prohibited from issuing or making any such public announcement or statement to the extent it is necessary to do so in order to comply with the applicable laws, rules or regulations of any government, legal proceedings or stock exchange having jurisdiction over such Party or its Affiliates.
