other than in secondary recovery operations, that processing and 
utilisation shall follow a development plan approved in accordance with 
clause 20. 
(2) The contractor shall return associated natural gas, not 
required for use in petroleum operations or sold, to the subsurface 
structure, but if such natural gas cannot be economically used or sold or 
returned to the subsurface structure, the contractor shall, after expiry of 
sixty (60) days' notice to the Minister giving reasons why such natural gas 
cannot be economically used or sold or returned to the subsurface 
structure, be entitled to flare such associated natural gas in accordance to 
good international petroleum industry practice. Notwithstanding anything 
in this clause to the contrary, associated natural gas may be flared at any 
time if necessary for the conducting of well and production tests and 
during any emergency. 
(3) Where the contractor does not consider that it is 
economical to process and utilise associated natural gas and where that 
natural gas is not required for use in petroleum operations, the Minister 
may at the field separator, process and utilise that natural gas without 
compensation but the Government shall pay for all costs and expenses 
related thereto which shall include, but not be limited to, any engineering 
studies, new fixtures, equipment and installations required for the 
gathering, transport, processing and utilisation thereof and the operation 
and maintenance of same shall be at the sole risk, cost and expense of 
the Government. 



 (4) Where the contractor considers that it is economical to 
produce natural gas, the contractor agrees to sell all or part of its share of 
natural gas to the Government, provided that the parties agree upon the 
price (to be determined in accordance with sub-clause 26(3)), volume and 
terms of sale.

(1) The volume and quality of petroleum produced and saved 
from the contract area shall be measured by methods and appliances 
customarily used in good international petroleum industry practice and 
approved by the Minister. 



 (2) The Minister may inspect the appliances used for 
measuring the volume and determining the quality of petroleum and may 
appoint an inspector to supervise the measurement of volume and 
determination of quality. 
(3) Where the method of measurement, or appliances used 
therefore, have caused an overstatement or understatement of a share of 
the production, the error shall be presumed to have existed since the date 
of the last calibration of the measurement devices, unless the contrary is 
shown, and an appropriate adjustment shall be made for the period of 
error. 
(4) The Minister and the contractor shall determine the 
measurement point at which production shall be measured and the 
respective shares of petroleum allocated. 


26. VALUATION OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS 

 
(1) The value of crude oil, for all purposes under this contract, 
shall be denominated in United States dollars and shall be calculated 
each calendar quarter as follows - 
(a) if there have been sales of crude oil produced from the 
contract area to third parties at arm's length during that calendar quarter, 
the value shall be the weighted average per unit price actually paid in 
those sales, at the F.O.B. point of export or at the point that title and risk 
pass to the buyer, adjusted for grade, gravity and quality of such crude oil 
as well as for transportation costs and other appropriate adjustments for 
grade, gravity, and quality of such crude oil transaction where the seller 
and the buyer are independent of one another and do not have, directly or 
indirectly, any common interest; 


 (b) if there have been no sales of crude oil produced from the 
contract area to third parties at arm's length during that calendar quarter, 
the value shall be the "fair market value" determined as the average per 
unit prevailing market price, actually paid during that calendar quarter in 
arm's length sales for export under term contracts of at least ninety (90) 



days between unrelated purchasers and sellers, for crude oil produced in 
Kenya and in the major crude oil producing countries, and adjusted for 
grade, gravity and quality of such crude oil as well as for transportation 
costs and any other appropriate adjustments. 
If necessary, a value of crude oil shall be determined 
separately for each crude oil or crude oil mix and for each point of 
delivery. 
The value of crude oil shall be mutually agreed at the end of 
each calendar quarter and applied to all transactions that took place 
during the quarter. 
If the Minister and the contractor cannot reach agreement on 
the value of crude oil within thirty (30) days of the end of any calendar 
quarter, such determination shall be made by an internationally 
recognized expert appointed by the contractor and the Minister, but if they 
fail to agree within thirty (30) days on the appointment of such expert, then 
by the International Chamber of Commerce. The expert shall report his 
determination within twenty (20) days of his appointment and his 
determination shall be final and binding upon the Government and the 
contractor. 
(2) Pending the determination of the value of crude oil for a 
calendar quarter, the value of crude oil determined for the preceding 
calendar quarter will be provisionally applied to make calculation and 
payment during such calendar quarter until the applicable value for that 
calendar quarter is finally determined pursuant to sub-clause 26 (1). Any 
adjustment to provisional calculation and payment, if necessary, will be 
made within thirty (30) days after such applicable value is finally 
determined. 


 (3) Natural gas shall be valued based on the actual proceeds 
received for sales, provided that, for sales of natural gas between the 
contractor and any affiliate, the value of such natural gas shall not be less 
than the then prevailing fair market value for such sales of natural gas 
taking into consideration, to the extent possible, such factors as the 



markets, the quality and quantity of natural gas and other relevant factors 
reflected in natural gas pricing.

AND PARTICIPATION 

 

27. COST RECOVERY, PRODUCTION SHARING, WINDFALL AND 
INCOME TAX 

 
(1) Subject to the auditing provisions under clause 30, the 
contractor shall recover the petroleum costs, in respect of all petroleum 
operations, incurred and paid by the contractor pursuant to the provisions 
of this contract and duly entered in the contractor's books of account, by 
taking and separately disposing of an amount equal in value to a 
maximum of ….. percent (%) of all crude oil produced and saved from 
the contract area during that fiscal year and not used in petroleum 
operations. Such cost recovery crude oil is hereinafter referred to as "cost 
oil". 
(2) Petroleum costs may be recovered from cost oil in the 
following manner: 
(a) petroleum costs, with the exception of capital expenditures, 
incurred in respect of the contract area, shall be recoverable either in the 
fiscal year in which these costs are incurred and paid or the fiscal year in 
which commercial production occurs, whichever is the later; and 
(b) capital expenditure incurred in respect of each 
development area shall be recoverable at a rate of twenty percent (20%) 
per annum based on amortization at that rate starting either in the fiscal 
year in which such capital expenditure are incurred and paid or the fiscal 
year in which commercial production from that development area 
commences, whichever is the later. 

 For the purpose of this clause, "capital expenditure" shall 
mean the qualifying expenditure, other than "intangible drilling costs", that 
is expenditure that has no salvage value, including expenditure on labour, 
fuel, repairs, maintenance, hauling, mobilization and supplies and 
materials, other than supplies and materials for well casings or other well 



fixtures, which is for or incidental to drilling, cleaning, deepening, 
completing or abandoning wells and is incurred in respect of – 
(i) The determination of well locations, geological and 
geophysical studies, and topographical and geographical surveys 
preparatory to drilling; 
(ii) The drilling, shooting, testing, and cleaning of wells; and 
(iii) The clearing, draining and levelling of land, road-building 
and laying of foundations. 
(c) To the extent that, in a fiscal year, the petroleum costs 
recoverable according to sub-clauses 27 (2) (a) and 27 (2) (b) exceed the 
value of all cost oil for such fiscal year, the excess shall be carried forward 
for recovery by the contractor in the next succeeding fiscal year or fiscal 
years until fully recovered, but in no case after the termination of this 
contract. 
(d) To the extent that, in a fiscal year, the petroleum costs 
recoverable according to sub-clauses 27 (2) and 27 (2) (b) are less than 
the maximum value of the Cost Oil as specified in sub-clause 27 (1), the 
excess shall become part of, and be included in the profit oil as provided 
for in sub-clause 27 (3) hereafter. 
(e) For the purpose of valuation of cost oil, the provisions of 
clause 26 hereof shall apply. 
(3) (a) The total crude oil produced and saved from the 
contract area and not used in petroleum operations less the cost oil as 
specified in sub-clauses 27 (1) and 27 (2), shall be referred to as the profit 
oil and shall be shared, taken and disposed of separately by the 
Government and contractor according to increments of profit oil as 
follows: 




Daily Production 
(bopd) 

Government 
Share 

Contractor 
Share 

0- 20,000 bopd 

 

 

20,001-30,000 bopd 

 

 

30,001-50,000 bopd 

 

 

50,001-100,000 bopd 

 

 

Over 100,000 bopd 

 

 



 
For the purpose of this sub-clause, increments of profit oil shall be 
calculated by considering the total crude oil produced and saved from the 
contract area less the quantity of cost oil required to satisfy recoverable 
costs, expenses and expenditures according to sub-clauses 27 (1) and 27 
(2). 
(b) Where two or more reservoirs are sufficiently close so that they 
utilize the same surface installation, they shall be considered, for the 
purposes of sub-clause 27(3) (a), as being one development area. When 
making a proposal for the delineation of a development area and its 
associated development plan, the contractor shall consider in priority the 
option which is the most favourable for the Government in terms of profit 
oil split. 
(c) Windfall Profits : When the value of Crude Oil for any calendar 
quarter calculated in accordance with clause 26 exceeds US$ 50 per bbl 
FOB Mombasa(hereinafter referred to as the “Threshold Price”) then a 
Second Tier Amount is payable by the Contractor to the Government. 
The Second Tier Amount will be calculated in respect of each calendar 
quarter according to the following formula: 
R = CSPO x 26% x (V – Threshold Price) 
Where; 
R is the Second Tier Amount in US Dollars; 


 V is the value of crude oil in U.S. dollars for that calendar 
quarter calculated in accordance with Clause 26 and expressed in 



US$/bbl, provided that V exceeds the Threshold Price; and 
CSPO is the Contractor Share of Profit Oil for that calendar 
quarter in bbl calculated pursuant to clause 27 (3) (a). 
(d) The Second Tier Amount will be payable within thirty (30) days 
following the end of the calendar quarter for which it is due. For the 
purposes of this Contract the Second Tier Amount will be treated as an 
adjustment to Profit Oil. 


(e) The Threshold Price set forth in this sub-clause 27(3)(c) is US$ 
50/bbl F.O.B Mombasa at the…….day of……………… in any calendar 
quarter the Threshold Price during that calendar quarter shall be derived 
by multiplying the Threshold Price, by the number (hereinafter referred to 
as the "price index") which is the sum of one (1) and the decimal 
equivalent of the percentage increase in the United States Consumer 
Price Index, as reported for the first time in the monthly publication 
"International Finance Statistics" of the International Monetary Fund, 
between the month of November 2007 and the month when such 
valuation is calculated. 
(4) With respect to sub-clauses 27 (1), 27 (2) and 27 (3), cost 
oil and profit oil calculations shall be done quarterly on an accumulative 
basis. To the extent that actual quantities, costs and expenses are not 
known, provisional estimates of such data based on the adopted annual 
production work programme and budget under clause 24 shall be used. 
Within sixty (60) days of the end of each fiscal year, a final calculation of 
cost oil and profit oil based on actual crude oil production in respect of that 
fiscal year and recoverable petroleum costs shall be prepared and any 
necessary adjustments shall be made. 
(5) The contractor shall be subject to and shall comply with the 
requirements of the income tax laws in force in Kenya, which impose 
taxes on or are measured by income or profits. 


 The portion of the crude oil which the Government is entitled 
to take and receive under sub-clause 27 (3) shall be inclusive of all taxes 



based on income or profits, including specifically tax payable under the 
Income Tax Act, and dividend tax imposed by Kenya on any distribution of 
income or profits by the contractor, but shall exclude the tax paid by the 
contractor on behalf of petroleum service sub-contractors. 
The Government agrees to pay and discharge as and when 
due such taxes for account of the contractor and the Minister agrees to 
furnish the contractor with proper receipts from the Government 
evidencing the payment of all such taxes on contractor's behalf for each 
fiscal year. The contractor shall prepare and file a Kenya income tax 
return for each fiscal year within four (4) months after the close of each 
fiscal year. The receipts furnished by the Minister evidencing payment of 
such taxes shall correspond to the amount of taxes payable on behalf of 
the contractor by the Government. The receipts shall be issued by the 
duly constituted authority for the collection of Kenya income taxes and 
shall be furnished within three (3) months after the date the contractor 
files its Kenya income tax return for the fiscal year. 
All taxes paid by the Government in the name and on behalf of 
the contractor shall be considered income to the contractor for the fiscal 
year to which the tax payments relate. 
(6) If so directed by the Minister, the contractor shall be 
obligated to lift and market part or the entire Government share of profit 
oil. 
When the Minister elects not to take and receive in kind any 
part of the Government share of profit oil, the Minister shall notify the 
contractor three (3) months before the commencement of each semester 
of a calendar year, specifying the quantity of production and such notice 
shall be effective for the ensuing semester. Any sale by the contractor of 
the Government share of profit oil shall not be for a term of more than one 
(1) year without the Minister's consent. 

 The price paid by the contractor for the Government share of 
profit oil shall be the price established according to clause 26. The 
contractor shall pay the Government on a monthly basis, such payments 
to be made within thirty (30) days after the end of the month in which the 



production occurred. 
(7) At a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of 
commencement of commercial production, the parties shall agree to 
procedures covering the scheduling, storage and lifting of petroleum 
produced from the agreed upon point of export or delivery. 
(8) In the event that the contractor elects to produce a natural 
gas discovery, the petroleum costs incurred by the contractor and directly 
attributable to the discovery and production of such natural gas shall be 
recovered from part thereof. The parties agree that the Government and 
the contractor shall share the natural gas produced and saved and not 
used in petroleum operations in accordance and on an equivalent basis 
with the percentage allocations provided for cost recovery and production 
sharing of crude oil under this clause. For this purpose, six thousand 
(6000) cubic feet of natural gas at a temperature of 15 degrees centigrade 
and pressure of one atmosphere shall be deemed to be equivalent to one 
(1) barrel of crude oil.

 (2) In each calendar year, the Minister shall notify the 
contractor not less than three (3) months prior to the beginning of that 
calendar year, of the domestic supply requirement. The maximum amount 
of crude oil that the Minister may require from the contractor's share of 
production shall be calculated each calendar quarter, and shall be equal 
to the excess of total crude oil domestic consumption in Kenya multiplied 
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the average crude oil production

(a) The Decommissioning Plan is to form part of the development plan, 
and shall include a schedule for the amortization of costs and cost 
recovery of costs, which are estimated to be incurred when the 



development is decommissioned. 
“Decommissioning Plan” means the plan for the decommissioning, 
abandonment, recovery and removal, or if applicable re-deployment, of 
wells, flow lines, pipelines, facilities, infrastructure and assets related to 
Petroleum Operations. 
(b) The Contractor shall exercise its good faith judgment to book sufficient 
accruals for future abandonment and decommissioning operations to 
cover the expenses which are expected to be incurred under the 
Decommissioning Plan. Contractor shall examine on an annual basis, the 
estimated costs of abandonment and decommissioning operations and, if 
appropriate, revise them. 
(c) The Contractor shall commence booking accruals for abandonment 
and decommissioning costs in the first calendar quarter in which the ratio 
of cumulative production to overall recoverable reserves reaches 60%, 
unless otherwise agreed in the development plan. 
(d) All abandonment and decommissioning costs shall be recovered as 
Petroleum Costs at the time that the accrual is entered in the books. 
(e) Contractor shall book an accrual on a calendar quarter basis for the 
amount of future abandonment and decommissioning costs according to 
the following formula: 
FTA = (ECA – AFB) X CPP/PRR 
Where: 
FTA is the amount to be accrued for future abandonment and 
decommissioning costs in respect of the relevant calendar quarter. 
ECA is the total estimated cost of abandonment and decommissioning 
operations established pursuant to this Abandonment and 
Decommissioning Clause. 
CPP is the volume of Petroleum produced during the calendar quarter in 
which the abandonment and decommissioning accrual was booked. 

PRR is the Contractor’s estimated remaining recoverable reserves at the 



end of the calendar quarter in which the abandonment and 
decommissioning accrual was booked; as such estimates may be 
revised by Contractor from time to time. 
AFB is the accrued abandonment and decommissioning cost balance at 
the end of the previous calendar quarter. 
42(2) Commencements of Abandonment and Decommissioning 
Operations 
(a) Abandonment and decommissioning will be scheduled to occur after 
a discovery reaches its Economic Limit. “Economic Limit” shall mean 
that point in the life of field where expected Revenue to Contractor from 
Petroleum Operations is insufficient to cover the operating costs to 
continue Petroleum Operations in accordance with the requirements of 
the Contract. In addition, “Revenue” means the expected revenues 
derived from the sale of Petroleum together with any firm tariff income 
earned by the field facilities, if any. 
(b) On or before the start of the 720 calendar day period prior to the 
expected date of abandonment and decommissioning, the Minister shall 
notify Contractor which of the facilities and assets identified in the 
development and production program shall not be abandoned and 
decommissioned, but which shall revert to the ownership of the 
Government in accordance with Clause 12 of this Contract. No further 
funds to cover abandonment and decommissioning costs shall be 
reserved or accrued for the facilities and assets so identified and a 
corresponding adjustment shall be made, if necessary, by Contractor. 
(c) If, the Minister decides not to use the said assets, he shall have the 
right to require the Contractor to remove them at the latter's expense in 
accordance with the said Decommissioning Plan, it being understood that 
the abandonment and decommissioning operations shall be carried out by 
the Contractor in accordance with good international petroleum industry 
practice, this Contract and in accordance with the time schedule and 
conditions defined in the Decommissioning Plan which shall have been 
approved. 




42 (3) Abandonment and Decommissioning upon Termination of 
Development Area 
(a) If Contractor recommends abandonment and or decommissioning of 
facilities assets or wells belonging to it in connection with a termination 
of an Development Area, pursuant to Clause 3(5) of the Contract, the 
Government may elect to take ownership of and continue using such 
facilities, assets and wells by giving Contractor written notice of such 
decision within sixty (60) calendar days of the Government's receipt of 
Contractor's notice of relinquishment. Upon so notifying Contractor, 
which notification is effective as of the effective date of Contractor’s 
relinquishment, the Government shall take ownership of, and be 
responsible for, abandonment and decommissioning such facilities, 
assets and wells. 
If Government does not elect to continue using such facilities, assets or 
wells, Contractor shall be responsible for their abandonment and 
decommissioning upon termination of the Contract or of the 
Development Area within the corresponding Development area, if earlier. 
Contractor may in consultation with Government defer the abandonment 
and decommissioning operations for a reasonable length of time if this 
would result in operational efficiencies, which minimize the cost for all 
parties. 
42 (4) Facilities, Assets and Wells, Which the Government Continues to 
Use 
With respect to any facilities, assets or wells which the Government 
elects to own pursuant to this Contract or pursuant to these 
Abandonment and Decommissioning provisions: 
(a)The Government shall conduct such continued use and/or abandon or 
decommission in accordance with generally accepted international 
petroleum industry practice and in such a manner that does not interfere 
with continuing Petroleum Operations; and 
(b)The Government may abandon and decommission such facilities, 
assets and wells as and when the Government decides. 



 42 (5) Disbursements of Funds for Abandonment and Decommissioning 
Costs 
(a) The Contractor will advise the Government on an annual basis its 
best estimate of the projected date of abandonment and 
decommissioning of the discovery based on the then current estimate of 
when the Economic Limit will be reached according to the then current 
production forecast and realized oil prices. 
(b) As and when the Contractor commences booking accruals pursuant 
to these provisions, the Contractor will cause the accrued costs of 
abandonment and decommissioning operations to be set aside in a 
separate US$ interest bearing escrow account in the joint names of the 
Contractor and the Government, established at a mutually acceptable 
financial institution in London, England to be used solely for paying the 
decommissioning costs. The account is to be funded on a quarterly 
basis by each entity constituting the Contractor and the Government in 
proportion to each such entity’s then current participating equity interests 
in the Contract out of its share of ongoing cost oil and profit oil 
attributable to the Contractor and the Government entities, or by cash 
payment if production is insufficient. A final reconciliation shall be 
submitted to all Contractor parties and the Government following 
completion of all abandonment and decommissioning operations and 
adjustments made in accordance with the Clause below. 
42 (6) Adjustments to Accruals for Abandonment and Decommissioning 
Costs 
(a) If excess accruals which were booked for abandonment and 
decommissioning costs remain following completion of all abandonment 
and decommissioning operations, then such excess funds shall be 
distributed to Contractor and Government in the same proportion as the 
cumulative profit oil distribution to Government and Contractor under 
Clause 27 of the Contract during the years that the accruals for 
abandonment and decommissioning costs were booked by Contractor. 


(b) Any abandonment and decommissioning cost accruals which have 



been booked for purposes of removing facilities or assets that the 
Government decides should not be removed shall be paid by Contractor 
to Government concurrently with the transfer of ownership of such 
facility, asset or well to the Government. The Government represents 
that the transferred funds shall only be used in conjunction with its 
abandonment and decommissioning operations. 
If amounts accrued for abandonment and decommissioning costs 
are insufficient to complete abandonment and decommissioning 
activities, additional funds for such activities shall be provided from a 
portion of Crude Oil which Contractor is entitled to receive under the 
Contract from any development area, or if no production is available, by 
cash payment by the entities constituting Contractor and the 
Government in the same ratio as would be applicable for distribution of 
excess amounts under Clause (a) of this Clause 27.

banking day of that month and the operator shall include with such notice 
an estimate of the cash calls for the next three (3) months. The operator's 
estimate of expenditure shall not exceed the approved year's budget. The 
operator may, at any time upon fifteen (15) days' written notice, request 
additional advances to cover unforeseen expenditure. 
3. Cash requirements shall be specified by the operator in the 
currencies required for the petroleum operations and the non-operators 
shall advance their shares in the currencies so specified. 
4. If any non-operator's advances for a given month exceed its 
share of cash disbursements for the same month, the next succeeding 
cash advance, after such determination, shall be reduced accordingly. 
However, non-operator(s) may request that excess advances be 
refunded. The operator shall make such refund within fifteen (15) days 
after date of such notice. 
5. Where a party is in default of payment, the operator and the 
non-defaulting parties shall have, as security for amounts due hereunder 
from a defaulting non-operator, a lien on the participating interest share, 
the interest in material and equipment acquired for the petroleum 
operations and upon the proceeds from the sale of petroleum, of that non- 
operator, and a non-operator shall have for amounts due hereunder, a 
similar lien on the same interests and property of the operator. 
6. A lien may be exercised by a non-defaulting party by 
collecting the amount due from a purchaser of petroleum and the 
statement of the operator of the amount due shall be proof thereof. 
7. A late payment shall attract interest at LIBOR 
plus...............per cent (......%) or...........per cent (.......%), whichever is the 
greater, compounded monthly and calculated from the due date of

due date shall accrue interest from the due date and the non-paying party 
shall be deemed to be in default from the due date of the payment. 



 8. A party which remains in default for five (5) days shall have 
no right to vote at any operating committee meeting held during the period 
of the default but shall be bound by all decisions of the operating 
committee made during such period, and the defaulting party's 
participating interest shall be deemed to be vested pro-rata in the non- 
defaulting parties for voting purpose during the continuation of the default. 
9. Where a party fails to pay an amount required to be paid 
hereunder, and remains in default for ninety (90) days, the participating 
interest share of the defaulting party may be declared forfeit by the non- 
defaulting parties, unless the amount due is an advance and the 
defaulting party provides an irrevocable letter of credit or other security, 
acceptable to the operator, for the amount due. 
10. When the participating interest share of a defaulting party 
is declared forfeit, the operator shall give notice thereof to all the parties, 
and that share shall vest rateably, unless otherwise agreed, in the non- 
defaulting parties without payment of compensation and the defaulting 
party shall at its sole expense take all steps necessary to vest that share 
accordingly, and the defaulting party hereby appoints the operator to act 
as its attorney to execute any and all documents required to effect such 
transfer. Notwithstanding the transfer of a defaulting party's participating 
interest share in accordance with the foregoing, the defaulting party shall 
remain liable for its proportionate share of the commitments incurred 
before its rights lapsed. 
11. Where a party is in default of payment, the remaining 
parties shall advance the operator on demand a share of that payment, in

same in such manner as the operator shall deem appropriate; provided, 
however, that each Party may, if practicable, separately take or sell and 
dispose of its interest in such material or equipment or may by notice in 
writing, and subject to revocation at will, authorize the operator, for a 
period or periods of not more than one (1) year each, to sell such material 
and equipment for the account of the party or parties giving such 
authorization. Each party shall have the right to purchase, at the 
prevailing market price in the area, material or equipment which the 
operator has declared to be surplus and which the operator intends to 
dispose of on the open market. 
4. Subject to the provision of clause 12 of the Contract, upon 
termination of this Participation Agreement the operator shall salvage for 
the jointly-owned material and equipment which can reasonably be 
salvaged, to be disposed of as provided in Article 7 (3) hereof.

purchase said interest, each shall have the right to acquire such interest in 
the proportion that the Participating Interest hereunder of such party bears 
to the sum of the Participating interests of all the parties exercising such 
right except as they may otherwise agree. 
(d) If within such a period of thirty (30) days, none of the other 
parties shall exercise its rights to purchase said interest, the sale to said 
offeror may be made under the terms and conditions set forth in the notice 
given; provided that the sale shall be consummated within six (6) months 
from the date of such notice and that the sale and any transfer shall be in 
accordance with the Contract and applicable law. 
(e) For the purpose of this paragraph, an offer to purchase 
shall also include an acceptance of an entity's offer to sell. 
4. The limitations of Article 9 (3) shall not apply to transfer of a 
participating interest by a party to an affiliate of such party, or by the 
Contractor to an acceptable assignee as defined in the Contract, or by the 
Government to an appointee, or from an appointee to another appointee, 
nor shall they apply to a transfer of a participating interest effected as a 
result of merger, consolidation, re-organization or sale of capital stock of 
the parent company of a Party. 


 5. Every transfer of a participating interest in the participation 
area shall be made expressly subject to this Participation Agreement and 
shall include a corresponding interest in jointly acquired equipment and 
facilities. No transfer of an interest hereunder shall be effective unless 
made by an instrument in writing duly executed by the parties thereto in 
accordance with applicable law, and until the same has received all 
consents required under this Participation Agreement and the Contract. A 
transfer shall provide that the transferor remains liable for obligations 
incurred before the date of transfer and such obligations shall in addition 



become the obligations of the transferee. Where after the transfer, the 
transferee or transferor owns a participating interest of less than five per 
cent (5%), they shall be jointly represented. 
6. A transfer other than to an affiliate on an appointee shall be 
of sufficient financial standing to meet its participating interest share of its 
obligations under the Contract and this Participation Agreement. In the 
event of a transfer of a participating interest to an affiliate of a party the 
transferor party shall remain responsible for the full performance by the 
affiliate of the obligations undertaken by said party under this Participation 
Agreement and the Contract, and if such affiliate ceases to be an affiliate, 
the participating interest shall be transferred back to the party. 
7. In this Article, transfer means a transfer, assignment, sale 
or other disposal of the interest of a party. 
10. DISPOSAL OF PRODUCTION 
1. Each party shall separately own, take in kind and dispose of 
its participating interest share of that portion of the petroleum produced 
and saved from the participation area to which the Contractor is entitled 
under clause 27 of the Contract. 
2. Within six (6) months following the signing of this 
Participation Agreement, the parties shall, in accordance with the 
provisions of the Contract and in light of the gathering and transportation 
facilities available under the adopted development plan, in good faith 
establish a set of rules governing the scheduling, lifting and other 
necessary provisions for the crude oil offtakes of the parties, consistent 
with good international petroleum industry practice, which shall provide, 
among other things, such detailed terms and procedures as required for- 
(a) Short-term production forecasts; 
(b) Nomination and calculation of entitlements; 
(c) Scheduling of deliveries; 
(d) Lifting tolerances; 




 (e) Under lift, over lift and make-up provisions; 
(f) Passage of title and risk; 
(g) Penalties assessable to the Parties which cause shut-in or 
reductions of production; and 
(h) Other related matters. 
Whatever is mutually agreed by the Parties shall be deemed 
to form part of this Participation Agreement. 
The above terms and procedures shall apply separately to 
each grade of crude oil that is segregated and separately stored for off 
take. 


 3. The Government may request from time to time that the 
Contractor purchase all or part of the Government's participating interest 
share of crude oil. The Contractor shall use its best efforts to comply with 
this request but in the event that the Contractor is not able to take such 
crude oil, then the Contractor will assist the Government in good faith to 
market such crude oil at the best price, terms and conditions available in 
the international market for the sale of such crude oil. 
4. In the event of production of associated natural gas or of 
any discovery of natural gas, the parties shall agree upon appropriate 
procedures for disposal of any natural gas available under this 
Participation Agreement and the Contract. 
11. SOLE RISK OPERATIONS 
1. Any party may undertake petroleum operations at sole risk 
(hereinafter referred to as "sole risk project") in a participation area, 
subject to the provisions of this Article. 
2. The following types of sole risk project may be proposed- 


 (a) the drilling of a well or the deepening, side-tracking, 
completing, plugging back, testing or reworking of an existing well drilled 
for the joint account of the parties, in order to test a formation in which no 



jointly-owned well has been completed as a well producing or capable of 
producing petroleum; 
(b) The installation of production and transportation facilities. 
3. The conduct of a project in a development area may not be 
the subject of a sole risk notice under this Article until after it has been 
proposed in complete form to the operating committee for consideration 
pursuant to Article 4 hereof and has not been approved within the period 
therein provided. 
In the event that such project fails to obtain the requisite 
approval of the operating committee, then any party may serve notice on 
the other parties of its intention to carry out that project at sole risk. The 
other parties may give counter-notice that they wish to participate in the 
project within sixty (60) days after receipt thereof but, where a drilling rig is 
on the location and has not been released, the period is reduced to 
seventy-two (72) hours after receipt thereof. The periods set forth in this 
Article 11 (3) shall be extended for any period of time mutually agreed by 
the parties as necessary or desirable for acquiring or developing 
additional information on the sole risk project. 
4. If all the other parties elect to participate in the project 
identified in the proposing party's notice within the period thereof provided, 
such project is considered as being approved by the operating committee 
and the provisions of Article 4 (8) of this Participation Agreement shall 
apply. 
5. In the event that less than all the parties elect to participate 
in the project, the parties which elected to participate (hereafter referred to 
as "sole risk parties") shall be entitled to have the sole risk project carried 
out. 
The interest of each sole risk party in a sole risk project shall 
be in proportion to its participation interest in this Participation Agreement, 
or in such other proportion as the sole risk parties may agree. Any sole 
risk project shall be carried out at the sole risk, cost and expense of the 
sole risk parties in the proportion of their respective interests. 


 6. A sole risk project shall be carried out by the operator on 
behalf of the sole risk parties under the provisions of this participation 



agreement. No sole risk project may be commenced after one hundred 
and eighty (180) days following the expiration of the notice period 
prescribed in Article 11 (3), but the operator shall commence work as 
promptly as reasonably possible if the notice period of seventy two (72) 
hours, set forth in Article 11 (3), applies. The operator shall complete the 
sole risk project with due diligence provided that it does not jeopardize, 
hinder or unreasonably interfere with petroleum operations carried out 
under the Contract and adopted by the operating committee pursuant to 
Article 4 of this Participation Agreement. 
The sole risk parties may use for the sole risk project any 
production, handling, processing and/or transporting facilities, which are 
joint property, subject to a determination by the operating committee as to 
usage fees, availability of capacity and production compatibility. 
7. In connection with any sole risk project- 
(a) the sole risk project will be carried out under the overall 
supervision and control of the sole risk parties in lieu of the operating 
committee; 
(b) the computation of costs and expenses of the sole risk 
project incurred by the sole risk parties shall be made in accordance with 
the principles set out in exhibit"A" attached hereto; 
(c) the operator carrying out the sole risk project shall maintain 
separate books, records and accounts (including bank accounts) for the 
sole risk project which shall be subject to the same right of examination 
and audit by the sole risk parties; 
(d) the costs and expenses of the sole risk project shall not be 
reflected in the statements and billing rendered by the operator for 
petroleum operations under the Participation Agreement; and 


 (e) if the operator is carrying out a sole risk project on behalf 
of the sole risk parties, the operator shall be entitled to request the sole 
risk parties in connection with the sole risk project to advance their share 
of the estimated expenditure and shall not use joint account funds or be 
required to use its own funds for the purpose of paying the costs and 
expenses of the sole risk project; furthermore the operator shall not be 



obliged to commence or, having commenced, to continue the sole risk 
project unless and until relevant advances have been received from the 
sole risk parties. 
8. The sole risk parties shall indemnify and hold harmless the 
other parties against all actions, claims, demands and proceedings 
whatsoever brought by any third party arising out of or in connection with 
the sole risk project and shall further indemnify the other parties against 
all damages, costs, losses and expenses whatsoever directly or indirectly 
caused to or incurred by them as a result of anything done or omitted to 
be done in the course of carrying out such sole risk project. 
9. Subject to the provision of Article 11 (10) below, the sole 
risk project, including data and information, is wholly owned by the sole 
risk parties in accordance with the provisions of the Contract, but the sole 
risk parties shall keep the other parties informed about the project. 
In the event that such project results in an increase of 
production of petroleum from the participation area, the portion of such 
increase, which is available to the Contractor, shall be owned solely by the 
sole risk parties. Each of them shall have the right and obligation to take 
in kind, and separately dispose of its proportional share of supplementary 
petroleum production. 
10. Any party or parties which are not participating in the sole 
risk project may, by giving thirty (30) days' notice to the sole risk parties, 
become participants in such project, at any time after the sole risk parties 
have recovered from the supplementary petroleum production the 
following sums of money to which they are entitled on the project: 
In the case of a project under Article 11 (2) (a) hereof........per 
cent (........%) of the Sole Risk cost of such project, plus one hundred per 
cent (100%) of the cost of operating such well incurred by the Sole Risk 
Parties. 
In the case of a project under Article 11 (2) (b) 
hereof..........per cent (.......%) of the Sole Risk cost of such project, plus 
one hundred per cent (100%) of the cost of operating such facilities. 


 The value of the supplementary production to which a Sole 
Risk Party is entitled shall be the market value in sales at arm's length, 



determined in accordance with clause 26 of the Contract. 
From and after the election of any party or parties to become 
participants in such project, all relevant wells, facilities, equipment and 
other property appurtenant thereto shall be owned jointly by the 
participating parties and each of the participating parties shall be entitled 
to receive its proportional share of the supplementary petroleum 
production. 
12. CONFIDENTIALITY 
1. All information related to the petroleum operations shall be 
confidential and shall not be disclosed to a person other than a party

 3. The parties shall consult with each other prior to the release 
of any public statement or press release, and except to the extent 
required by law, rule or regulation of any government authority or stock 
exchange, no party shall make any public statement or press release 



without the approval of all the other parties, which shall not be 
unreasonably withheld. The operator shall utilize its best efforts to co- 
ordinate all such public statements to the end that all Parties may effect 
simultaneous press releases. 
4. The obligations of the parties under this Article 12 are 
continuing obligations and any party ceasing to be a party to this 
Agreement shall remain bound by this Article until this Agreement is no 
longer in force between any remaining parties and the Contract has 
expired. 
13. LIABILITY 
1. The parties shall be severally liable in accordance with their 
respective participating interest to third parties. 
2. Where the Government has nominated an Appointee, as 
defined in clause 28 (1) of the Contract, and the appointee defaults the 
Government shall be liable. 
3. If because of the operation of the joint and several liability 
provisions contained in the Contract, any one of the Parties hereto shall 
be required to pay in full to the Government or any other party, any sum 
which, if the liability were several, would be required separately from each 
of the Parties or from one other party only, then the Party (ies) shall notify 
forthwith and request immediate payment of the Party’s (ies') 
proportionate share according to its Participating interest. If within ten 
(10) days from receipt of said notice, the other Party (ies) shall fail to 
make payment as provided above such Party (ies) shall be in default and

EXHIBIT "A" 
ACCOUNTING PROCEDURE 
Attached to and made a part of the Participation Agreement. 
TABLE OF CONTENTS 
Section 1 - General Provisions 
1.1 - Interpretation 
1.2 - Statements, billings and adjustments 
1.3 - Advances and payments 
1.4 – Audits 




 SECTION 1 
GENERAL PROVISIONS 
The purpose of this accounting procedure is to establish 
equitable methods for determining charges and credits applicable to 
operations under the Agreement. 
It is the intent of the Parties that no Party shall lose or profit by 
reason of its duties and responsibilities as either operator or as non- 
operator and that no duplicate charges to the joint account for the same 
work shall be made. 
The parties agree that if any procedure established herein 
proves unfair or inequitable to any party, the parties shall meet and in 
good faith endeavour to agree on the changes necessary to correct that 
unfairness or inequity. 
1.1. - INTERPRETATION 
1.1.1. In this Exhibit- 
(i) "The Agreement" means the Participation Agreement, 
of which this Exhibit forms part, 
(ii)"the Contract" means the production sharing contract 
to which the Agreement is attached 
(iii) Words and expressions defined in the Agreement, 
the Contract and its appendices have the meanings therein ascribed to 
them. 
1.1.2. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of the 
Agreement and this exhibit, the provisions of the Agreement shall prevail. 
1.1.3. By mutual agreement between the parties, this 
accounting procedure attached to the Agreement may be revised from 
time to time by an instrument in writing signed by the parties. 




 1.2. - STATEMENTS, BILLINGS AND ADJUSTMENTS 
1.2.1. The operator shall maintain financial accounts 
necessary to record in reasonable details the transactions relating to 
petroleum operations under the Agreement which shall be prepared in 
accordance with generally accepted standards of the international 
petroleum industry. The operator shall upon request by the Party furnish 
a description of its accounting classifications. 
1.2.2. Each party to the Agreement is responsible for 
preparing its own accounting and tax reports and paying of its own tax 
obligations to meet Kenyan requirements. The operator shall furnish the 
non-operator(s) with all reports, statements, billings and accounting 
documents necessary to maintain their own accounting records. 
1.2.3. The operator shall bill the non-operator(s) on or before 
the last day of each month for their proportionate share of expenditure for 
the preceding month. Such billings shall be accompanied by statements 
of all charges and credits to the joint account, summarized in reasonable 
detail by appropriate accounting classifications indicative of the nature 
thereof, except that items of controllable material and unusual charges 
and credits shall be detailed. 
1.2.4. The operator shall, upon request by non-operator(s) 
furnish a description of such accounting classifications. 


 1.2.5. Amounts included in the billings shall be expressed in 
the currency in which the operator's records are maintained. In the 
conversion of currencies when accounting for advances or payments in 
different currencies as provided for in sub-section 1.3., or any other 
currency transactions affecting operations under the Agreement, it is the 
intent that none of the parties shall experience an exchange gain or loss 
at the expense of, or to the benefit of, the other Parties. It is agreed that 
any loss or gain to the joint account resulting from the exchange of 
currency required for operations under the Agreement or from the 
translations required, shall be charged or credited to the joint account. 
The operator shall furnish the parties with a description of the procedure 
applied by the operator to accomplish said translation or exchange of 
currencies and provide currency exchange data sufficient to enable non- 
operator(s) to translate the billings to the currency of the non-operator(s) 



accounts. 
1.2.6. Payment of billings by non-operator(s) shall not 
prejudice the right of any non-operator(s) to protest or question the 
correctness thereof; however, all bills and statements rendered to non- 
operator(s) by the operator during any year shall conclusively be 
presumed to be true and correct after twenty-four (24) months following 
the end of any such year, unless within the said twenty-four (24) month 
period a non-operator takes written exception thereto and makes claim on 
the operator shall be made unless it is made within the same prescribed 
period. The provisions of this Sub-section shall not prevent adjustment 
resulting from a physical inventory or the joint property or from a third 
party claim. 
1.3. - ADVANCES AND PAYMENT 
1.3.1. If operator so requests, non-operator(s) shall advance 
to the operator the non-operator(s)' share of estimated cash requirements 
for the succeeding month's operation in accordance with Article 6 of the 
Agreement. Operator shall make written request for the advance to non- 
operator(s) at least twenty (20) days prior to the first banking day of such 
succeeding month. The advance shall not be due and payable before the 
first banking day of the month for which the advance is requested. The 
request shall set out the funds in the currencies to be expended as 
estimated by the operator to be required. The non-operator(s) shall on or 
before the due date make corresponding advances in the currencies 
requested by depositing such funds to operator's account at a bank as 
may be from time to time designated by the operator. 
1.3.2. Should the operator be requested to pay any large 
sums of money for operations under the Agreement, which were 
unforeseen at the time of providing the non-operator(s) with said monthly 
estimates of its requirements, the operator may make a written request of 
the non-operator(s) for special advances covering the non-operators' 
share of such payments. Non-operator(s) shall advance to operator their 
share of such advances within fifteen (15) days after date of such notice. 


 1.3.3. If non-operators' advances exceed their share of actual 
expenditure, the next succeeding cash advance, after such determination, 
shall be reduced accordingly. However, non-operator(s) may request that 



excess advances be refunded. The operator shall make such refund with 
fifteen (15) days after the date of such notice. 
1.3.4. If non-operators' advances are less than their share of 
actual expenditure, the deficiency shall, at operator's option, be added to 
subsequent cash advance requirements or be paid by non-operators 
within fifteen (15) days following operator's billing to non-operator(s) of 
such deficiency. 
1.3.5. If the operator does not request non-operator(s) as 
provided in sub-part 1.3.1., to advance their share of estimated cash 
requirements, non-operator(s) shall pay their share of actual expenditure 
within fifteen (15) days following date of operator's billing. 
1.3.6. Payments of advances or billings shall be made on or 
before the due date; and if not so paid, the unpaid balance shall be 
treated as provided under Article 6 of the Agreement. 
1.4. - AUDITS 
1.4.1. A non-operator, upon at least thirty (30) days' advance 
written notice to the operator and other non-operator(s), shall have the 
right at its sole expenses to audit the joint account and related records for 
any year or portion thereof within the twenty-four (24) month period 
following the end of such year; however, the conducting of an audit shall 
not extend the time for the taking of written exception to and the 
adjustment of accounts as provided for in sub-part 1.2.5. The operator 
shall make every reasonable effort to co-operate with the non-operators, 
and the non-operators shall make every reasonable effort to conduct 
audits in a manner which will result in a minimum of inconvenience to the 
operator. 
1.4.2. All adjustments resulting from an audit agreed between 
the operator and the non-operator conducting the audit shall be rectified 
promptly in the joint account by the operator and reported to the other 
non-operator. Any unresolved dispute arising in connection with an audit 
shall be referred to arbitration in accordance with Article 15 of the 
Agreement. 


 1.4.3. Except as otherwise provided in the Contract, the cost 
of any audit or verification of the joint account that is for the benefit of all 



parties shall be chargeable to the joint account if the parties mutually 
agree. 
SECTION 2 
CHARGEABLE COSTS, EXPENDITURE AND CREDITS 
The operator shall charge the joint account for all those costs 
and expenditure necessary to conduct petroleum operations under the 
agreement pursuant to the provisions of sub-parts 2.12. inclusive of 
appendix "B" to the Contract. 
The operator shall credit the joint account for all the 
proceeds resulting from petroleum operations under the Agreement 
pursuant to the provisions of sub-part 2.31. of Appendix "B" to the 
Contract.
