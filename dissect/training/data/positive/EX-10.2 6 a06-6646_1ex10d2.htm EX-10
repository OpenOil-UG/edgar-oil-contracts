ACCOUNTING METHODS TO BE USED TO CALCULATE
 
RECOVERY OF OPERATING COSTS
 
3.1
Depreciation
 
 
 
Depreciation will be calculated beginning the Calendar Year in which the asset is placed into service with a full Calendar Year’s depreciation allowed the initial Calendar Year. The method used to calculate each Calendar Year’s allowable recover), of Capital Costs is the declining balance depreciation method. Calculation of each such Calendar Year’s allowable recovery of Capital Costs should be based on the individual asset’s Capital Cost at the beginning of such year multiplied by the depreciation factor as follows, for:
 
Group 1 =
 
50
%
Group 2 =
 
25
%
Group 3 =
 
10
%
 
For the Groups of capital assets for any Crude Oil project, apply useful lives as follows:
 
Group -1
 
 
 
 
Automobiles
 
1.5
 
years
Trucks-light (13,000 pounds or less) and tractor units
 
2
 
years
Trucks-heavy (more than 13,000 pounds) and trailers

For the Groups of capital assets for any Natural Gas projects, apply fifty percent (50%) of the following useful lives:
 
Group 1
 
 
 
 
Automobiles
 
3
 
years
Trucks-light (13,000 pounds or less) and tractor units
 
4

The balance of unrecovered Capital Costs is eligible for full depreciation at the end of the individual asset’s useful life. The undepreciated balance of assets taken out of service will not be charged to Operating Costs but will continue depreciating based upon the lives described above, except where such assets have been subjected to unanticipated destruction, for example, by fire or accident.
 
 
3.2
Overhead Allocation
 
 
 
General and administrative costs, other than direct charges, allocable to this operation should be determined by a detailed study, and the method determined by such study shall be applied each year consistently. The method selected must be approved by PERTAMINA, and such approval can be reviewed periodically by PERTAMINA and CONTRACTOR.
 
37

 
3.3
Interest Recovery
 
 
 
Interest on loans obtained by a Party from Affiliates or parent companies or from third party non-affiliates at rates not exceeding prevailing commercial rates for capital investments in Petroleum Operations may be recoverable as Operating Costs. Details of any financing plan and amounts must be included in each year’s Budget of Operating Costs for the prior approval of PERTAMINA. All other financing must also be approved by PERTAMINA.
 
 
3.3
Gas Costs
 
 
 
Operating Costs directly associated with the production of Natural Gas will be directly chargeable against Natural Gas revenues in determining entitlements under clause 6.2.2 of Section VI. Operating Costs incurred for production of both Natural Gas and Crude Oil will be allocated to Natural Gas and Crude Oil based on the relative value of the products produced for the current Year. Common support costs will be allocated on an equitable basis agreed to by both parties.
 
 
 
If after commencement of production the Natural Gas revenues do not permit full recovery of Natural Gas costs, as outlined above, then the excess costs shall be recovered from Crude Oil revenues. Likewise, if excess Crude Oil costs (Crude Oil costs less Crude Oil revenues) exist, this excess can be recovered from Natural Gas revenues.
 
 
 
If production of either Natural Gas or Crude Oil has commenced while the other has not, the allocable production costs and common support costs will be allocated in an equitable mailer. Propane and butane fractions extracted from Natural Gas but not spiked in Crude Oil shall be deemed as Natural Gas for the purpose of accounting.
 
 
3.4
Inventory Accounting
 
 
 
The costs of non-capital items purchased for inventory will be recoverable at such time the items have landed in Indonesia.
 
 
3.6
Insurance and Claims
 
 
 
Operating Costs shall include premiums paid for insurance normally required to be carried for the Petroleum Operations relating to CONTRACTOR’s obligations conducted under the Contract, together with all expenditures incurred and paid in settlement of any and all losses, claims, damages, judgment and other expenses, including fees relating to CONTRACTOR’s obligations under the Contract.
 
 
3.7
Abandonment and Site Restoration
 
 
 
Operating Costs shall include all expenditures incurred in the abandonment of all exploratory wells and the restoration of their drill sites, together with all estimates of monies required for the funding of any abandonment and site restoration program established in conjunction with an approved plan of development for a commercial discovery.
 
 
 
Expenditures incurred in the abandonment of exploratory, wells and the restoration of their drill sites shall be charged as Operating Costs in accordance with Article II of this Exhibit “C”.
 
 
 
Estimates of monies required for the funding of any abandonment and site restoration program established pursuant to paragraph (e) of clause 5.2.5 of the Contract shall be charged as Operating Costs annually on the basis of accounting accruals beginning in the year of first production. The amount charged in each Year will be calculated by dividing the total estimated cost of abandonment and site restoration for each discovery by the total estimated number of years in the economic life of each discovery. The estimates of monies required for all abandonment and site restoration activities shall be reviewed on an annual basis and such estimates shall be adjusted each Year as required.
 
EXHIBIT “D”
 
This Exhibit “D” is attached to and made an integral part of the Contract for the Bengara-II Contract Area by and between PERUSAHAAN PERTAMBANGAN MINYAK DAN GAS BUMI NEGARA (PERTAMINA) and APEX BENGARA LTD. (CONTRACTOR) and is dated as of the Effective Date therein defined.
 
MEMORANDUM ON PARTICIPATION

38

 
4.             The Operator shall prepare the annual Work Program and budget which shall be submitted to the authorized representative of both parties for decisions prior to submission to PERTAMINA in accordance with the provisions of the Contract.
 
5.             In respect of any exploratory drilling operations, a “nonconsent” provision shall be made which assures the Indonesian Participant that it does not have to participate in such operations if it were to disagree to the inclusion of such operations in the Work Program and budget, and which, in case of success, adequately compensates CONTRACTOR for the costs and risks incurred by the latter.
 
6.             Subject to adequate lifting tolerances, each party shall offtake at CONTRACTOR’s point of export its production entitlement in its proportionate share of any portion of the Crude Oil which PERTAMINA elects not to take in kind, both as provided under the Contract. However, if the Indonesian Participant is not in a position to market such quantity wholly or partly, it shall in respect of the quantity which it cannot market itself, have the option under an adequate notification procedure, either: to require CONTRACTOR (or its associates if CONTRACTOR so desires) to purchase that quantity, or to lift that quantity at a later date under an adequate procedure.
 
7.             In respect of any quantity to be purchased from the Indonesian Participant by CONTRACTOR (or its associates) the price in respect of each quality Crude Oil shall be:
 
7.1           for Crude Oil to be delivered for local consumption under the terms of the Contract, fifteen percent (15%) of the price as provided in Section-VII or as otherwise provided for in the Contract and
 
7.2           for all other Crude Oil the weighted average net realized price received by CONTRACTOR for comparable types and quantities sold by it during the Calendar Year involved minus five percent (5%).
 
8.             If Natural Gas is encountered in commercial quantities, special provisions shall be drawn up having due regard, inter alia, to the long term character of Natural Gas supply contracts.
