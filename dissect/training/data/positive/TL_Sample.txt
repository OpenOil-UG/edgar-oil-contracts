insufficient time for the Contractors (acting, and having acted, in accordance with this Agreement) to 
Appraise it, the obligation of the Contractors under Section 3.2 shall be postponed: 

(i) for such area as the Contractors may propose and the Ministry may determine to be reasonably 
necessary for Appraisal of the Discovery; 
(ii) for such period as is reasonably necessary to permit the Contractors to Appraise (or to complete 
the Appraisal of) the Discovery; and 
(iii) as a consequence of that Appraisal, for the Contractors to decide whether to declare a 
Commercial Discovery and, if it does so, for the Ministry to declare a Development Area in 
respect of it. 


3.3 Relinquishment of Development Area 

(a) Except with the consent of the Ministry, a Development Area shall be deemed to be relinquished on the 
first to occur of: 

(i) production from the Development Area ceasing permanently or for a continuous period of 
twelve (12) months (or, if because of Force Majeure, twenty four (24) months or such greater 
period as determined by the Ministry, in consultation with the Contractors under Section 20.2); 
and 




(ii) the twenty fifth (25th) anniversary of the date on which the first (1st) Development Plan in 
respect of the Development Area was approved by the Ministry. 


(b) Without the consent of the Ministry, the Contractors may not otherwise relinquish all or any part of a 
Development Area. 

3.4 Termination of Agreement and Continuing Obligations in respect of Relinquished Area 

 

(a) This Agreement shall terminate in respect of a part of the Contract Area which is relinquished. 

(b) Relinquishment of all or a part of the Contract Area is without prejudice to the obligations of the 
Contractors to Decommission. 

3.5 Gas Retention Area 

 

(a) If the Appraisal of a Discovery of Non-Associated Gas demonstrates that the Discovery, although 
substantial, is not then, either alone or in combination with other Discoveries, commercially viable, but 
is likely to become so within five (5) years, the Ministry may, at the request of the Contractors, declare 
a Gas Retention Area in respect of it for that period. 

(b) This Article 3 (but not Section 3.3) applies to and in respect of a Gas Retention Area as it does to and in 
respect of a Development Area for as long as, during that period, the Contractors diligently seek to 
make it commercially viable, and demonstrate to the Ministry that they are doing so. 

(c) The Gas Retention Area consists of a single contiguous area that encompasses the Gas Field, plus a 
reserve margin sufficient to cover the probable and possible extent of it, but the Ministry may exclude 
deeper formations in which no Discovery has been made. The Ministry, at any time and from time to 
time, and whether of its own volition or at the request of the Contractors, may: 

(i) increase; 
(ii) decrease; or 
(iii) vary the depth within the Contract Area of; 


a Gas Retention Area as may be required to ensure that it encompasses the Gas Field. The Contractors shall 
relinquish any part of the Contract Area removed from a Gas Retention Area as a consequence of such decrease 
or other variation if it occurs after the time for the relinquishment provided for in paragraph 3.2(a). 

(d) The Gas Retention Area shall be deemed to have been relinquished on the earlier of: 

(i) expiry of the period mentioned in paragraph 3.5(a) and 3.5(e); 
(ii) the Contractors ceasing to meet their obligations under paragraph 3.5 (b); and 
(iii) the Contractors declaring a Commercial Discovery in respect of it and the Ministry declaring a 
Development Area as a consequence thereof. 


(e) Upon request of the Contractor the Ministry may in its sole discretion extend the period for the Gas 
Retention Area for another period of maximum five (5) years.

4.4 Performance of Exploration Work Programme and Budget 

(a) If any well forming part of the Exploration Work Programme and Budget provided for in this Article 4 
is abandoned for any reason other than a reason specified in paragraph 4.4(b) before reaching the 
defined objectives of such well, the Contractors shall drill a substitute well. In this event, the first, 
second or third Exploration period, as the case may be, shall be extended by a period of time equal in 
length to the time spent in preparing for and drilling the substitute well, including mobilisation and 
demobilisation of the drilling rig, if applicable. 

(b) Unless otherwise agreed by the Ministry, any well which forms part of the Exploration Work 
Programme and Budget provided for in this Article 4 shall be drilled to such depth as is necessary for 
the evaluation of the geological formation established by the available data as the target formation and 
which Good Oil Field Practices would require the Contractors to attain, unless before reaching such 
depth: 

(i) a formation stratigraphically older than the deepest target formation is encountered; 
 



(ii) basement is encountered; 
(iii) further drilling would present an obvious danger, such as but not limited to the presence of 
abnormal pressure or excessive losses of drilling mud; 
(iv) impenetrable formations are encountered; 
(v) Petroleum-bearing formations are encountered which require protecting, thereby preventing 
planned depths from being reached; or 
(vi) the Contractors and the Ministry agree to terminate the drilling operation; and 
(vii) the Ministry confirms that the drilling obligation has been fulfilled. 


In such circumstances the drilling of any such well may be terminated at a lesser depth and shall be deemed to 
have satisfied the Contractors’ obligations in respect of that well. 

(b) Where a well which forms part of the Exploration Work Programme and Budget provided for in this 
Article 4 results in a Discovery and the Contractors inform the Ministry pursuant to Section 4.9 that the 
Discovery merits Appraisal, that well will be deemed to have met its objective and to have satisfied the 
Contractors’ obligations in respect of that well. 

4.5 Consequences of Non-Performance 

(a) If, in a Contract Year, the Contractors carry out less Exploration than is required of them under the 
Exploration Work Programme, the Ministry may: 

(i) terminate this Agreement and require payment by way of liquidated damages of the estimated 
cost of the Exploration Work Programme and Budget not carried out; 
(ii) require payment by way of liquidated damages of the estimated cost of the Exploration not 
carried out; or 
(iii) require that the shortfall be added to the Exploration Work Programme and Budget to be carried 
out in the next Contract Year. 


The Parties agree that the amount payable under this paragraph 4.5(a) is a reasonable estimate of the loss 
which would be suffered by the Ministry. 

(b) If, in a Contract Year, the Contractors carry out more Exploration than is required of them, the excess 
shall be credited against Exploration to be carried out in the following Contract Year and, to the extent 
in excess of that Exploration, shall be further carried forward. 

(c) For the purposes of the foregoing provisions of this Article 4, Article 6 and Annex C, and except with 
the consent of the Ministry, no work in a Development Area will be regarded as Exploration except in 
respect of a formation deeper than the Field concerned and in which no Discovery has been made. 

4.6 Work Programmes and Budgets 
 
Subject to Section 4.7, the Contractors shall carry out Petroleum Operations substantially in accordance with 
Work Programmes and Budgets approved by the Ministry. Such an approval by the Ministry is without 
prejudice to any other obligations or liabilities of the Contractors under this Agreement. 

4.7 Emergency and Other Expenditures Outside Work Programmes and Budgets 

(a) Without further approval by the Ministry, the Contractors may over-expend, by the lesser of fifty 
thousand United States Dollars (USD $50,000) or ten percent (10%) on any line item in an approved 
Work Programme and Budget for a Contract Year. 




(b) Without further approval by the Ministry, the total of all over-expenditures under paragraph 4.7(a) 
under that Work Programme and Budget for that Contract Year shall not exceed the lesser of one 
million (USD $1,000,000) United States Dollars or five percent (5%) of the total expenditures in that 
Work Programme and Budget. 
(c) The Contractors shall promptly inform the Ministry if they anticipate (or should reasonably anticipate) 
that any such limit in paragraph 4.7(b) will be exceeded and seek, in the manner provided in this Article 
4, an amendment to the appropriate Work Programme and Budget. 
(d) In determining whether to approve the over-expenditures contemplated at paragraphs 4.7(a) and 4.7(b), 
the Ministry shall consider whether such increases are necessary to complete the programme of works, 
provided that such increase is not the result of any failure of the Contractors to fulfil their obligations 
under this Agreement. 
(e) Nothing in Section 4.6 or paragraph 4.7(a) precludes or excuses the Contractors from taking all 
necessary and proper measures for the protection of life, health, the environment and property if there is 
an emergency (including a significant fire, explosion, Petroleum release, or sabotage; incident involving 
loss of life, serious injury to an employee, contractor or third party, or serious property damage; strikes 
and riots; or evacuation of the Operator’s personnel). As soon as reasonably practicable, the Operator 
will inform the Ministry of the details of the emergency and of the actions it has taken and intends to 
take. 
4.8 Exploration 




(a) The Contractors shall submit annually, for the approval of the Ministry, the Exploration Work 
Programmes and Budgets required by Sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 for each Contract Year. 

(i) Exploration Work Programme and Budget for the first Contract Year shall be submitted to the 
Ministry within forty-five (45) days from Effective Date.

to the Ministry at least ninety (90) days prior to the end of each current Contract Year. 


(b) From time to time, the Contractors may submit, for the approval of the Ministry, amendments to the 
Exploration Work Programme and Budget. 

(c) The Contractors are not obliged to carry out more Exploration in a Contract Year than is required by 
Sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3. 

4.9 Discovery and Appraisal 

(a) The Contractors shall notify the Ministry of a Discovery and shall provide the Ministry with such 
information in respect of it as the Act requires. 
(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after a Discovery is made, the Contractors shall advise the Ministry 
whether or not, having regard to paragraph 4.9(e), the Discovery merits Appraisal. 
(c) At such time and in such manner as the Ministry requires, the Contractors shall submit, for the approval 
of the Ministry, an Appraisal Work Programme and Budget for each Calendar Year. 
(d) From time to time the Contractors may submit, for the approval of the Ministry, amendments to the 
Appraisal Work Programme and Budget. 
(e) An Appraisal Work Programme and Budget for a Calendar Year will be such as would be undertaken 
by a person seeking diligently to Appraise (in accordance with this Agreement) a Discovery with a view 
to determining if it is, either alone or in combination with other Discoveries, a Commercial Discovery. 




4.10 Commercial Discovery 


(a) The Contractors may, at any time and having regard to paragraph 4.10(b), declare that a Commercial 
Discovery has been made. 
(b) The declaration is to be made in such manner, and be accompanied by such supporting data and 
information, as the Ministry requires, and as the State-Owned Contractor requires to make its election 
under Section 8.1, including the Contractors’ proposal as to that part of the Contract Area to be declared 
a Development Area. 


(c) The Ministry shall declare a single contiguous area encompassing the Field in which the Commercial 
Discovery has been made, to be a Development Area, but may exclude deeper formations in which no 
Discovery has been made. 

(d) The Ministry, at any time and from time to time, may: 

(i) increase; 

(ii) decrease; or 

(iii) vary the depth within the Contract Area of; 

a Development Area as may be required to ensure that it encompasses the Field concerned, but not, 
unless the Ministry and the Contractors otherwise agree, after the first Development Plan in respect of 
the Development Area has been approved. The Contractors shall relinquish any part of the Contract 
Area removed from a Development Area as a consequence of such decrease or other variation, if it 
occurs after the time for the relinquishment provided for in paragraph 3.2(a). 

4.11 Development Plan 

(a) Not more than twelve (12) months after the declaration of a Development Area, and in the manner 
required by the Ministry, the Contractors shall submit, for the approval of the Ministry, a Development 
Plan for the Development Area. 

(b) From time to time, and in like manner, the Contractors may submit, for the approval of the Ministry, 
amendments to the Development Plan. 

(c) A Development Plan will be such as would be undertaken by a person seeking diligently to develop and 
exploit (in accordance with this Agreement) the Petroleum in the Development Area in the long term, 
best interests of the Parties. 

(d) Except with the consent of the Ministry, and without prejudice to the generality of paragraph 4.11(a), a

Gas downstream of the point at which it is to be sold by the Contractors and which are 
relevant to the price at which (and other terms on which) it is to be sold by the 
Contractors or are otherwise relevant to the determination of the value of it for the 
purposes of this Agreement, but not beyond the point at which it is first disposed of in 
an arm’s length transaction; and 

(cc) all contracts and arrangements made or to be made by the Contractors in respect of 
facilities downstream of the Field Export Point for transporting, processing, liquefying, 
storing, handling and delivering that Natural Gas; and 

(xii) such other data and information (including in respect of insurance to be obtained by the 
Contractors, and buyers and shippers of Petroleum) as the Act requires and as the Ministry

(f) The Ministry shall specify its reasons for not approving a Development Plan or an amendment to it. 

4.12 Development Work Programmes and Budgets 

(a) At such time and in such manner as the Act requires, and as the Ministry otherwise requires, the 
Contractors shall submit, for the approval of the Ministry, a Development Work Programme and 
Budget for each Development Area for each Calendar Year. At any time and from time to time, the 
Contractor may submit, for approval, amendments to it. 

(b) A Development Work Programme and Budget for a Calendar Year shall be substantially in accordance 
with the Development Plan for the Development Area. 



4.13 Approved Contracts 

(a) The Contractors may not sell or otherwise dispose of Natural Gas from the Contract Area other than 
pursuant to an Approved Contract or as otherwise may be provided in the Development Plan or in this 
Agreement. 

(b) The Contractors may not use any facilities downstream of the Field Export Point for transporting, 
processing, treating, liquefying, storing, handling or delivering Petroleum other than under the terms of 
an Approved Contract. 

(c) The Contractors may not amend, waive or fail to enforce, any provision of an Approved Contract 
without the approval of the Ministry. 

4.14 Decommissioning 

(a) The Contractors shall submit to the Ministry, for its approval, pursuant to sub-paragraph 4.11(d)(iv), a 
Decommissioning Plan for the Development Area and a schedule of provisions for the 
Decommissioning Costs Reserve. 

(b) The Decommissioning Plan shall be revised and resubmitted to the Ministry for its approval at such 
times as are reasonable having regard to the likelihood that the Decommissioning Plan (including cost 
estimates thereunder) may need to be revised. 

(c) The Ministry may give opportunity to persons likely to be affected to make representations to it in 
respect of the Decommissioning Plan. 

(d) The Contractors shall carry out the Decommissioning Plan substantially in accordance with its terms. 

(e) Estimates of the monies required for the funding of the Decommissioning Plan shall be charged as 
Recoverable Costs beginning in the Calendar Year following the Calendar Year in which Commercial 
Production first occurs. The amount charged in each Calendar Year shall be calculated as follows: 

(i) The total Decommissioning Costs at the expected date of Decommissioning shall first be 
calculated. 

(ii) There shall be deducted from such total Decommissioning Costs the provisions for 
Decommissioning Costs made, and taken as Recoverable Costs, in all previous Calendar Years 
together with interest on such Recoverable Costs calculated to the approved date of 
Decommissioning at the actual or forecast rate of Uplift (whichever is applicable). 

(iii) The residual Decommissioning Costs, resulting from the calculations under sub-paragraphs 
4.14(e)(í) and 4.14(e)(ii), shall then be discounted to the Calendar Year in question at the 
forecast rate of Uplift for each Calendar Year remaining until the Calendar Year of 
Decommissioning. 

(iv) The discounted total of residual Decommissioning Costs shall then be divided by the total 
number of Calendar Years remaining prior to the Calendar Year of Decommissioning itself, 
including the Calendar Year in question. 

(v) The resultant amount shall be the addition to the Decommissioning Costs Reserve for the 
Calendar Year in question. 

(vi) It is the intention of this provision that the total accumulated provision allowed, including 
interest calculated to the Calendar Year of Decommissioning at the rate of Uplift, will equal the 
total Decommissioning Costs. 

(vii) If the amount in sub-paragraph 4.14(d)(v) is a negative amount, then such amount shall be 
treated as a reduction of Recoverable Costs for the Calendar Year in question. 



4.15 Decommissioning Security 

(a) Security pursuant to the Decommissioning Security Agreement shall be provided in an amount equal to 
the sum of provisions for Decommissioning Costs made, and taken as Recoverable Costs, in all 
previous years together with interest on such Recoverable Costs calculated to the end of the previous 
Calendar Year at the actual rate of Uplift. 

(b) Failure of each Contractor to provide Security and otherwise to fulfil its obligations under the 
Decommissioning Security Agreement, shall be a breach of this Agreement. 

Article 5 Conduct of Work

5.6 Operator and its Sub-Contractors 

(a) The Operator, and only the Operator, may carry out Petroleum Operations, and may do so by itself, its 
agents and sub-contractors. 

(b) This Section 5.6 does not relieve the Contractors of any obligation or liability under this Agreement, 
and the carrying out of Petroleum Operations by its agents or sub-contractors does not relieve the 
Operator (or the Contractors) of any obligation or liability under this Agreement. 

Article 6 Recoverable Costs 

6.1 Generally 

(a) Each Contractor’s accounts shall be prepared and maintained in accordance with Annex C. 

(b) Only costs and expenses incurred by the Operator in carrying on Petroleum Operations, and (unless 
there is only one Contractor and the Contractor is the Operator) properly charged to the Contractors 
under an agreement made between them and consented to by the Ministry, are Recoverable Costs, but 
without prejudice to any other provision of this Agreement which would result in any such cost or 
expense not being a Recoverable Cost. 

6.2 Recoverable Costs 

In any Calendar Year, Recoverable Costs are, subject as further provided in Annex C, the sum of those of the 
following that are not Ineligible Costs:

(ii) recoverable Appraisal Costs; 

(iii) recoverable Capital Costs; and 

(iv) recoverable Operating Costs; 

(b) Decommissioning Costs Reserve allowable in that year; 

(c) Recoverable Costs in the previous Calendar Year, to the extent in excess of the value of the 
Contractor’s share of Petroleum under sub-paragraph 7.1(b)(í) in that previous Calendar Year; and 

(d) a Quarterly amount equal to the product of the rate of Uplift and the Quarterly balance of outstanding 
Recoverable Costs, 

less Miscellaneous Receipts and less any deductions pursuant to paragraph 7.4(a). 



Article 7 Sharing Of Petroleum 

7.1 Determination of Shares 

In each Calendar Year, the Parties shall take and receive the following shares of every grade and quality of 
Petroleum as and when it is delivered at the Field Export Point: 

(a) the Ministry: 

(i) five (5) percent; plus 

(ii) its share of any balance as mentioned in paragraph 7.1(c); 

(b) the Contractor: 

(i) ninety five (95) percent but not more than is equal in value to Recoverable Costs for the

throughout each Calendar Year, on not less than ninety (90) days prior written notice to the 
Contractors before the start of the Calendar Year concerned, and 

(ii) in respect of Timor-Leste’s share of Natural Gas, in connection with its approval of the 
Development Plan. 

7.3 Lifting 

(a) Subject to this Agreement, each Contractor may lift, dispose of and export from Timor-Leste its share 
of Petroleum and retain the proceeds from the sale or other disposition of that share. 

(b) The Contractors and the Ministry shall, from time to time, make such agreements between them as are 
reasonably necessary, in accordance with Good Oil Field Practice and the commercial practices of the 
international petroleum industry, for the separate lifting of their shares of Petroleum. 

7.4 Title and Risk 

(a) Petroleum shall be at the risk of the Contractor until it is delivered at the Field Export Point. Without 
prejudice to any obligation or liability of the Contractors as a consequence of a failure of the

not justify the reduction in price as provided for in paragraph 3.8(c)(ii)(b), such 
material shall be priced on a basis that will result in a net charge to the accounts under 
this Agreement consistent with the value of the service rendered. 

(v) Premium prices - whenever material is not readily obtainable at published or listed 
prices because of national emergencies, strikes or other unusual causes over which the 
Contractor has no control, the Contractor may charge Petroleum Operations for the
