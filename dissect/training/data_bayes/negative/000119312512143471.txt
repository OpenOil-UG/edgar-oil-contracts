Taxes with respect to the Assets for the calendar year in which the Closing occurs; provided, however, that the Seller shall reimburse the Buyer for its pro rata share of such Taxes to the extent not previously paid by the Seller. An estimate of
such ad valorem and property Taxes, based upon the prior years ad valorem and property Tax assessments plus five percent (5%), together with a resulting calculation of the Closing Payment, is attached hereto as Exhibit 2(j)(ii). Such amount
shall be binding on the Parties as a final allocation of ad valorem and property Taxes notwithstanding the actual amount of Taxes paid by the Buyer and shall be included as an adjustment to the Purchase Price reflected in the Closing Payment, as
described in Section 2(c). The ad valorem and property Taxes for the year of Closing for which the Seller is responsible shall be determined by applying a fraction based on the number of days in the calendar year prior to the Closing Date to
such Taxes for the calendar year.  (k) Purchase Price Allocation. The Sellers Representative and the Buyer shall,
within thirty (30) days prior to the filing the respective 2011 federal Tax Returns of Blue Dolphin, Bitter Creek and the Buyer attempt in good faith to agree to an allocation of the Purchase Price among the Assets. Should the allocation be
agreed to, the Buyer, Blue Dolphin and Bitter Creek will (i) report the federal, state and local income and other Tax consequences of the transactions contemplated herein, and in particular report the information required by
Section 1060(b) of the Code, and jointly prepare Form 8594 (Asset Acquisition Statement under Section 1060) in a manner consistent with such allocation and (ii) not to take any position inconsistent therewith upon examination of any
Tax Return, in any refund claim, or in any litigation or investigation or otherwise, unless required by applicable Laws or with the consent of the other Parties. Blue Dolphin, Bitter Creek and the Buyer agree that each will furnish to the others a
copy of Form 8594 proposed to be filed with the Internal Revenue Service by such Party or any Affiliate thereof within ten (10) days prior to the filing of such form with the Internal Revenue Service. Should the Parties not agree as to the
allocation, they shall so indicate the same on their respective Form 8594 to the extent required by the Asset Acquisition Statement under IRC Section 1060. The Buyer further agrees that if the amount of the Purchase Price allocated to any of
the Assets by the Seller and the Buyer increases (or decreases) after the taxable year that includes the Closing Date, the Seller and the Buyer shall file Supplemental Asset Acquisition Statements on Form 8594 with their respective
income Tax Returns for the taxable year in which the increase (or decrease) is properly taken into account.

of this Agreement, each of the Parties will take such further action (including the execution and delivery of such further instruments and documents) as the other Party reasonably may request, all at the sole cost and expense of the requesting Party
(unless the requesting Party is entitled to indemnification therefore under Section 6, in which case the allocation of such cost and expense shall be in accordance with Section 6).

Buyers operations, is conducted during normal business hours and is limited solely to such legitimate purpose; provided that such access will not be construed to require the disclosure of Records that would cause the waiver of any
attorney-client, work product or like privilege; provided, further, that in the event of any litigation nothing herein shall limit either Partys rights of discovery under applicable Law. The Buyer shall have the same rights, and
the Seller shall have the same obligations, as are set forth in this Section 5(c) with respect to any copies of the records of the Seller pertaining to the Assets that are retained by the Seller, provided that such access will not be construed

Sellers Representative.  (ii) The Seller shall promptly deliver to the Buyer the original or a copy of any mail or other
communication received by it after the Closing pertaining to the Assets.  (e) Certificate of Non-foreign Status. On the

commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the amount of land required for the GIGS Valve Site and (ii) the GIGS Valve Site shall not unreasonably interfere with the operations of the Buccaneer Pipeline as of the Closing Date. After Blue
Dolphin has determined the GIGS Valve Site, Buyer shall execute in favor of Seller an easement in substantially the same form as Exhibit 2(d)-2 Pipeline and Valve Site Easement for a 2-year term; provided that such easement shall provide
that when Seller completes construction of a stub-up/GIGS connection, such stub-up/GIGS connection to be reasonably acceptable to Buyer, such easement shall become permanent with no additional fee, subject to abandonment and removal provisions in

 (e) Matters Involving Third Parties. 
(i) If any third party shall notify any Seller Party or Buyer Party (the Indemnified Party) with respect to any matter
(a Third Party Claim) that may give rise to a claim for indemnification against any Party (the Indemnifying Party) under this Section 6, then the Indemnified Party shall promptly (and in any event within 10
Business Days after receiving notice of the Third Party Claim) notify the Indemnifying Party thereof in writing. The failure of any Indemnified Party to give notice of any such Third Party Claim on a timely basis shall not affect the rights of the
Indemnified Party to indemnification hereunder unless the Indemnified Party demonstrates actual and material Adverse Consequences caused by such failure, in which case the Indemnified Partys right to be indemnified shall be reduced to the
extent the Indemnifying Party demonstrates actual and material Adverse Consequences caused by such failure.  (ii) The
Indemnifying Party (provided that for purposes of this Section 6(e) the Sellers Representative shall have the sole and exclusive right to act on behalf of the Seller as Indemnifying Party) will have the right to assume and thereafter
conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim with reputable counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; provided that, prior to the Indemnifying Party assuming control of such defense it shall first verify to the
Indemnified Party in writing that such Indemnifying Party shall be fully responsible (with no reservation of any rights) for all Adverse Consequences relating to such claim for indemnification and that (subject to all monetary limitations set forth
herein) it shall provide full indemnification (subject to the monetary limitations set forth herein) to the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim giving rise to such claim for indemnification hereunder; provided further, however,
that notice of the intention to so contest and defend shall be delivered by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party within 30 calendar days following receipt of the notice of the Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume control of such defense (unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Indemnified Party) and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified Party if (A) the
claim for indemnification relates to or arises in connection with any criminal or quasi criminal Proceeding; (B) the claim seeks an injunction or equitable or other non-monetary relief against the Indemnified Party; (C) the Indemnified
Party has been advised by counsel that a reasonable likelihood exists of a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party that would make it inappropriate in the reasonable judgment of such counsel, that the same
counsel represent both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party; (D) upon petition by the Indemnified Party, the appropriate court rules that the Indemnifying Party failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend such claim; or
(E) the Indemnified Party reasonably believes that the Adverse Consequences relating to the Claim could exceed the maximum amount that such Indemnified Party could then be entitled to recover under the applicable provisions of this
Section 6. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in such Third Party Claim and to be represented by counsel of its own choosing at its own cost and expense. The Indemnifying Party will not consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be withheld unreasonably), unless the judgment or proposed

   21 







 
settlement (A) involves only the payment of money damages and does not impose an injunction or other equitable relief upon the Indemnified Party, (B) does not involve a payment of money
damages that exceeds the maximum amount that such Indemnified Party could then be entitled to recover under the applicable provisions of this Section 6, and (C) provides that the Indemnified Party will be fully and completely released from
any further liability or obligation with respect to the matters which are the subject of such Third Party Claim, in which case consent shall not be required.  (iii) Unless and until the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of the Third Party Claim as provided in subsection 6(d)(ii), the Indemnified Party may defend against the Third Party Claim in any manner
it reasonably may deem appropriate, and the Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for all costs incurred in connection therewith.  (iv) In no event will the Indemnified Party consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party, which consent shall not be withheld unreasonably; provided that, (A) if the Indemnifying Party does not give notice to the Indemnified Party of its election to contest and defend any such Third Party Claim in accordance with
Section 6(d)(ii), then no such consent shall be required and the Indemnifying Party shall be bound by the result obtained with respect thereto by the Indemnified Party and (B) the Indemnified Party may consent to the entry of any judgment
or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party if such judgment or settlement would result in no liability to the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 6.
 (f) Determination of Amount of Adverse Consequences. The Adverse Consequences giving rise to any indemnification
obligation hereunder shall be limited to the actual loss suffered by the Indemnified Party (i.e., reduced by any insurance proceeds or other payment or recoupment received, realized or retained by the Indemnified Party as a result of the events
giving rise to the claim for indemnification net of any expenses related to the receipt of such proceeds, payment or recoupment, including retrospective or prospective premium adjustments, if any). The amount of the actual loss and the amount of the
indemnity payment shall be computed by taking into account the timing of the loss or payment, as applicable, using a 10 percent interest or discount rate, as appropriate. Upon the request of the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall
provide the Indemnifying Party with information sufficient to allow the Indemnifying Party to calculate the amount of the indemnity payment in accordance with this Section 6(f). An Indemnified Party shall take reasonable steps to mitigate
damages in respect of any claim for which it is seeking indemnification and shall use reasonable efforts to avoid any costs or expenses associated with such claim and, if such costs and expenses cannot be avoided, to minimize the amount thereof.
 (g) Special Indemnification Provisions. Notwithstanding any terms and provisions of this Agreement to the contrary,
from and after the Closing, the Seller hereby covenants and 
   22 







 
agrees to protect, defend, indemnify and save the Buyer, its successors and assigns, harmless from and against any and all Adverse Consequences incurred in connection with or arising out of all
