RECITALS
 
A.                                    The Borrowers, the Lenders and the Administrative Agent previously entered into that certain Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of May 31, 2013, as amended by that certain First Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of June 30, 2013, as amended by that certain waiver letter and amendment dated July 30, 2013 and as amended by that certain Third Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of September 11, 2013 (as amended, restated, supplemented or modified from time to time, the Credit Agreement) and certain other Loan Documents (as defined in the Credit Agreement) in connection therewith.
 
B.                                    The Borrowers have requested that the Administrative Agent and the Lenders amend the Credit Agreement to (i) decrease the pricing reflected in the definition of Applicable Margin, (ii) allow for Liens in an amount not to exceed $10,000,000 in the aggregate on assets acquired by the Borrowers or any of their Restricted Subsidiaries (or on assets of any Person acquired by Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries which Person then becomes a Restricted Subsidiary), (iii) permit as a Restricted Payment the issuance or sale of Sanchez Equity Interests in exchange for, or purchase or redemption of, Sanchez Preferred Stock and (iv) increase to 75% from 50% the maximum percentage of the Borrowers total Proved Reserves that may be hedged, and the Administrative Agent and the Lenders are willing to amend the Credit Agreement on the terms and conditions contained in this Fourth Amendment.
 
C.                                    In connection with the Fourth Amendment the Borrowing Base will be increased from $175,000,000 to $300,000,000, representing an increase of $125,000,000.  Since not every Lender desires to increase its Commitment by its Applicable Percentage of the $125,000,000 increase in the Borrowing Base, the Lenders have agreed to adjust their respective Applicable Percentages of the Maximum Credit Amount from and after the Fourth Amendment Effective Date as herein provided.

8.                                      No Implied Amendment, Waiver or Consent. This Fourth Amendment shall not constitute an amendment or waiver of any provision not expressly referred to herein and shall not be construed as a consent to any action on the part of the Borrowers that would require a waiver or consent of the Lenders or Required Lenders, as applicable, or an amendment or modification to any term of the Loan Documents except as expressly stated herein.
 
9.                                      Miscellaneous.  This Fourth Amendment is a Loan Document.  Except as affected by this Fourth Amendment, the Loan Documents are unchanged and continue in full force and effect.  However, in the event of any inconsistency between the terms of the Credit Agreement, as amended by this Fourth Amendment, and any other Loan Document, the terms of the Credit Agreement will control and the other document will be deemed to be amended to conform to the terms of the Credit Agreement.  All references to the Credit Agreement will refer to the Credit Agreement as amended by this Fourth Amendment and any other amendments properly executed among the parties.  Borrowers agree that all Loan Documents to which they are a party (whether as an original signatory or by assumption of the Obligations) remain in full force and effect and continue to evidence their respective legal, valid and binding obligations enforceable in accordance with their terms (as the same are affected by this Fourth Amendment or are amended in connection with this Fourth Amendment).  AS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT TO THE

13.                               Multiple Counterparts.  This Fourth Amendment may be separately executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to constitute one and the same agreement.  This Fourth Amendment may be transmitted and/or signed by facsimile, telecopy or electronic mail.  The effectiveness of any such documents and signatures shall, subject to applicable law, have the same force and effect as manually-signed originals and shall be binding on all Loan Parties, all Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank.  The Administrative Agent may also require that any such documents and signatures be confirmed by a manually-signed original thereof; provided, however, that the failure to request or deliver the same shall not limit the effectiveness of any facsimile document or signature.
 
14.                               Governing Law.  THIS FOURTH AMENDMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO ANY CHOICE-OF-LAW PROVISIONS THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION.
