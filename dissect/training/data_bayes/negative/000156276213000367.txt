			CREDIT AGREEMENT, dated as of April 12, 2012, among Endeavour International Corporation, a Nevada corporation (“Holdings”), Endeavour Energy UK Limited, a private limited company organized under the laws of England and Wales (the “Borrower”), the Lenders party hereto from time to time and Cyan Partners, LP, as Administrative Agent.  All capitalized terms used herein and defined in Section 1 are used herein as therein defined.
		
		
			W I T N E S S E T H:
		
		
			WHEREAS, subject to and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Lead Arranger has arranged, and the Lenders are willing to make available to the Borrower, the senior secured revolving loan facility provided for herein;
		
		
			NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS AGREED:
		
		
			SECTION 1.Definitions and Accounting Terms.
		
		
			1.01.Defined Terms.  As used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings (such meanings to be equally applicable to both the singular and plural forms of the terms defined):
		
		
			“5.5% Convertible Notes” means the 5.5% Convertible Senior Notes due 2016 issued by Holdings, including any related notes, guarantees, instruments and agreements executed in connection therewith.
		
		
			“11.5% Convertible Bonds” means the 11.5% Guaranteed Convertible Bonds due 2014 (extended to 2016) issued by Endeavour Energy Luxembourg S.a.r.l. and guaranteed by Holdings, including any related notes, guarantees, instruments and agreements executed in connection therewith.  
		
		
			“12% Senior Subordinated Notes” means the 12% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 issued by Holdings, including any related notes, guarantees, instruments and agreements executed in connection therewith.  
		
		
			“Additional Assets” shall mean:
		
		
			(1)any properties or assets used or useful in the Oil and Gas Business, other than Indebtedness or Capital Stock;
		
		
			(2)the Capital Stock of a Person that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of the acquisition of such Capital Stock by Holdings or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; or
		
		
			(3)Capital Stock constituting a Minority Interest in any Person that at such time is a Restricted Subsidiary; 
		
		
			provided, however, that any such Restricted Subsidiary described in clause (2) or (3) is primarily engaged in the Oil and Gas Business.
		
		

		
		  
		“Additional Guarantor Requirement” shall have the meaning provided in Section 7.12(c).
		
		
			“Additional Lender” shall have the meaning provided in Section 2.11.
		
		
			“Additional Security Documents” shall have the meaning provided in Section 7.12(a).
		
		
			“Adjusted Consolidated Net Tangible Assets” of a specified Person shall mean (without duplication), as of the date of determination, the remainder of:
		
		
			(1)the sum of:
		
		
			(a)discounted future net revenue from proved crude oil and natural gas reserves of such Person and its Restricted Subsidiaries calculated in accordance with SEC guidelines before any state or federal or other income taxes, as estimated by such Person in a reserve report prepared as of the end of the then most recently ended fiscal year of such Person for which audited financial statements are available, as increased by, as of the date of determination, the estimated discounted future net revenue from:
		
		
			(i)estimated proved crude oil and natural gas reserves of such Person and its Restricted Subsidiaries attributable to acquisitions consummated since the date of such reserve report, which reserves were not reflected in such reserve report, and
		
		
			(ii)estimated crude oil and natural gas reserves of such Person and its Restricted Subsidiaries attributable to extensions, discoveries and other additions and upward revisions of estimates of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves (including previously estimated development costs incurred during the period and the accretion of discount since the prior period end) due to exploration, development or exploitation, production or other activities which would, in accordance with standard industry practice, cause such revisions,
		
		
			in each case calculated in accordance with SEC guidelines (utilizing the prices utilized in such Person’s year end reserve report), 
		
		
			and decreased by, as of the date of determination, the estimated discounted future net revenue attributable to:
		
		
			(A)estimated proved crude oil and natural gas reserves of such Person and its Restricted Subsidiaries reflected in such reserve report produced or disposed of since the date of such reserve report, and
		
		
			(B)reductions in the estimated crude oil and natural gas reserves of such Person and its Restricted Subsidiaries reflected in such reserve report since the date of such reserve report due to changes in geological conditions or other factors which would, in accordance with standard industry practice, cause such revisions, in the case of clauses (A) and (B) calculated in accordance with SEC guidelines (utilizing the prices utilized in such Person’s year end reserve report); 
		
		

		
		  
		provided, however, that, in the case of each of the determinations made pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) above, such increases and decreases shall be estimated by Holdings’ petroleum engineers or any independent petroleum engineers engaged by Holdings for that purpose;
		
		
			(b)the capitalized costs that are attributable to crude oil and natural gas properties of such Person and its Restricted Subsidiaries to which no proved crude oil and natural gas reserves are attributable, based on such Person’s books and records as of a date no earlier than the date of such Person’s latest available annual or quarterly financial statements;
		
		
			(c)the Net Working Capital of such Person as of a date no earlier than the date of such Person’s latest available annual or quarterly financial statements; and
		
		
			(d)the greater of:
		
		
			(i)the net book value of other tangible assets of such Person and its Restricted Subsidiaries as of a date no earlier than the date of such Person’s latest available annual or quarterly financial statements, and
		
		
			(ii)the appraised value, as estimated by independent appraisers, of other tangible assets of such Person and its Restricted Subsidiaries as of a date no earlier than the date of such Person’s latest available annual or quarterly financial statements (provided that such Person shall not be required to obtain such an appraisal of such assets solely for the purpose of determining this value);
		
		
			minus
		
		
			(2)the sum of:
		
		
			(a)Minority Interests;
		
		
			(b)to the extent not otherwise taken into account in determining Adjusted Consolidated Net Tangible Assets, any net natural gas balancing liabilities of such Person and its Restricted Subsidiaries reflected in such Person’s latest audited financial statements;
		
		
			(c)to the extent included in clause (1)(a) above, the discounted future net revenue, calculated in accordance with SEC guidelines (utilizing the prices utilized in such Person’s year end reserve report), attributable to reserves subject to participation interests, overriding royalty interests or other interests of third parties, pursuant to participation, partnership, vendor financing or other agreements then in effect, or which otherwise are required to be delivered to third parties;
		
		
			(d)to the extent included in clause (1)(a) above, the discounted future net revenue calculated in accordance with SEC guidelines (utilizing the prices utilized in such Person’s year end reserve report), attributable to reserves that are required to be delivered to third parties to fully satisfy the obligations of such Person and its Restricted Subsidiaries with respect to Volumetric Production Payments on the schedules specified with respect thereto; and
		
		
			(e)the discounted future net revenue, calculated in accordance with SEC guidelines, attributable to reserves subject to Dollar-Denominated Production Payments that, based on the 
		
		  
		estimates of production and price assumptions included in determining the discounted future net revenue specified in clause (1)(a) above (utilizing the prices utilized in such Person’s year end reserve report), would be necessary to satisfy fully the obligations of such Person and its Restricted Subsidiaries with respect to Dollar-Denominated Production Payments on the schedules specified with respect thereto.
		
		
			If Holdings changes its method of accounting from the full cost method to the successful efforts method or a similar method of accounting, “Adjusted Consolidated Net Tangible Assets” of Holdings will continue to be calculated as if Holdings were still using the full cost method of accounting.
		
		
			“Administrative Agent” shall mean Cyan Partners, LP (or its designee, including any Person designated pursuant to Section 10.10(f)), in its capacity as Administrative Agent for the Lenders hereunder and under the other Credit Documents, and shall include any successor to the Administrative Agent appointed pursuant to Section 10.10.
		
		
			“Affiliate” of any specified Person shall mean any other Person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with such specified Person.  For purposes of this definition, “control,” as used with respect to any Person, means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management or policies of such Person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by agreement or otherwise.  For purposes of this definition, the terms “controlling,” “controlled by” and “under common control with” have correlative meanings.

			SECTION 2.Amount and Terms of Credit.
		
		
			2.01.The Commitments.  Subject to and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Lender severally agrees to make, at any time and from time to time on or after the Effective Date and prior to the Maturity Date with respect to its Commitment, a revolving loan or revolving 
		
		  
		loans (each, a “Loan” and, collectively, the “Loans”) to the Borrower, which Loans (i) shall be denominated in Dollars, (ii) may be repaid and reborrowed in accordance with the provisions hereof, and (iii) shall not exceed for any such Lender at any time outstanding the Available Commitment of such Lender at such time (with such outstanding Loans to be calculated without regard to any PIK Interest that may have been added to the outstanding principal amount of Loans pursuant to Section 2.07).  All references herein to a “Loan” or “Loans”, to “principal” or the “principal amount” of any Loan or Loans and other terms of like import shall mean Loans incurred by the Borrower plus PIK Interest that is added to outstanding principal of Loans pursuant to Section 2.07 minus repayments and prepayments of Loans pursuant to this Agreement.  For the avoidance of doubt, all Loans will be made by Lenders (including both Extending Lenders and Non-Extending Lenders) in accordance with their pro rata shares of the Commitments at such time until the Maturity Date with respect to the Non-Extended Commitments; thereafter, all Loans will be made by the Extending Lenders in accordance with their pro rata shares of the Commitments at such time.
		
		
			2.02.Minimum Amount of Each Borrowing.  The aggregate principal amount of each Borrowing shall not be less than $2,500,000.
		
		
			2.03.Notice of Borrowing.  (a) When the Borrower desires to incur Loans hereunder, the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent at the Notice Office at least five Business Days’ prior notice thereof; provided that any such notice shall be deemed to have been given on a certain day only if given before 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on such day.  Such notice (the “Notice of Borrowing”), shall be irrevocable and shall be in writing, or by telephone promptly confirmed in writing, in the form of Exhibit A, appropriately completed to specify:  (i) the aggregate principal amount of the Loans to be incurred pursuant to such Borrowing and (ii) the date of such Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day).  The Administrative Agent shall promptly (and in any event within one Business Day of receipt of a Notice of Borrowing) give each Lender notice of such proposed Borrowing, of such Lender’s proportionate share thereof and of the other matters required by the immediately preceding sentence to be specified in the Notice of Borrowing.
		
		
			(a)Without in any way limiting the obligation of the Borrower to confirm in writing any telephonic notice of any Borrowing or prepayment of Loans, the Administrative Agent may act without liability upon the basis of telephonic notice of such Borrowing or prepayment, as the case may be, believed by the Administrative Agent in good faith to be from an Authorized Officer of the Borrower, prior to receipt of written confirmation.  In each such case, the Borrower hereby waives the right to dispute the Administrative Agent’s record of the terms of such telephonic notice of such Borrowing or prepayment of Loans, as the case may be, absent manifest error.
		
		
			2.04.Disbursement of Funds.  No later than 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the date specified in each Notice of Borrowing, each Lender will make available its pro rata portion (determined in accordance with Section 2.06) of the Borrowing requested to be made on such date.  All such amounts will be made available in Dollars and in immediately available funds at the Payment Office, and the Administrative Agent will make available to the Borrower at the Payment Office the aggregate of the amounts so made available by the Lenders.  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by any Lender prior to the date of such Borrowing 
		
		  
		that such Lender does not intend to make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s portion of such Borrowing to be made on such date, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such amount available to the Administrative Agent on such date of Borrowing and the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount.  If such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such corresponding amount on demand from such Lender.  If such Lender does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent’s demand therefor, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower, and the Borrower shall immediately pay such corresponding amount to the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent also shall be entitled to recover on demand from such Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, interest on such corresponding amount in respect of each day from the date such corresponding amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower until the date such corresponding amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent, at a rate per annum equal to (i) if recovered from such Lender, the overnight Federal Funds Rate for the first three days and at the interest rate otherwise applicable to such Loans for each day thereafter and (ii) if recovered from the Borrower, the rate of interest applicable to the Loans, as determined pursuant to Section 2.07.  Nothing in this Section 2.04 shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to make Loans hereunder or to prejudice any rights which the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any failure by such Lender to make Loans hereunder.
		
		
			2.05.Notes.  (a)  The Borrower’s obligation to pay the principal of, and interest on, the Loans made by each Lender shall be stated in the Register maintained by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 11.15 and shall also be stated in a promissory note duly executed and delivered by the Borrower substantially in the form of Exhibit B, with blanks appropriately completed in conformity herewith (each, a “Note” and, collectively, the “Notes”).
		
		
			(b)Each Lender will note on its internal records the amount of Loans made by it (as well as any increase thereto as a result of the payment of PIK Interest) and each payment in respect thereof and prior to any transfer of any of its Notes will endorse on the reverse side thereof the outstanding principal amount of Loans evidenced thereby.  Failure to make any such notation or any error in such notation shall not affect the Borrower’s obligations in respect of such Loans.
		
		
			(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above in this Section 2.05, no failure of any Lender to obtain, maintain or produce a Note shall affect, or in any manner impair, the obligations of the Borrower to pay the Loans (and all related Obligations) incurred by the Borrower which would otherwise be stated therein in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement, and shall not in any way affect the security or guaranties therefor provided pursuant to any Credit Document.  Any Lender which does not have a Note shall in no event be required to make the notations otherwise described in preceding clause (b).  At any time when any Lender becomes a party to this Agreement, the Borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to the respective Lender a Note in an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Loans made or held by such Lender.
		
		
			2.06.Pro Rata Borrowings.  All Borrowings of Loans under this Agreement shall be incurred from the Lenders pro rata on the basis of their Available Commitments.  It is understood that no 
		
		  
		Lender shall be responsible for any default by any other Lender of its obligation to make Loans hereunder and that each Lender shall be obligated to make the Loans provided to be made by it hereunder, regardless of the failure of any other Lender to make its Loans hereunder.
		
		
			2.07.Interest.  (a)  The Borrower agrees to pay cash interest (“Cash Interest”) in respect of the unpaid principal amount of the Loans from the date of Borrowing thereof until the maturity thereof (whether by acceleration or otherwise), at a rate per annum equal to (i) during the period from the Effective Date until the Escrow Release Date, 12% and (ii) from and after the Escrow Release Date, 13%.
		
		
			(b)In addition to the payment of Cash Interest pursuant to preceding clause (a), the Borrower shall, during the period from the Effective Date until the Escrow Release Date, pay additional interest on the Loans at a rate per annum equal to 3.0% “in kind”, with the amount of interest accruing pursuant to this clause (b) being added to the outstanding principal amount of the Loans on each Quarterly Payment Date occurring during such period; provided that in the event the Borrower provides written notice thereof to the Administrative Agent prior to 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) at least two Business Days prior to the relevant Quarterly Payment Date, the Borrower may pay in cash interest accrued pursuant to this clause (b) that is payable on such Quarterly Payment Date.  Such paid-in-kind interest (“PIK Interest”) shall be deemed paid, and the principal amount of the Loans as so increased shall be deemed “Loans” hereunder and under the other Credit Documents for all purposes and shall thereafter accrue interest in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
		
		
			(c)Overdue principal and, to the extent permitted by law, overdue interest in respect of each Loan and all other overdue amounts payable hereunder and under any other Credit Document shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the rate which is 2% in excess of the rate then borne by the Loans.  Interest that accrues under this Section 2.07(b) shall be payable on demand.
		
		
			(d)Accrued (and theretofore unpaid) interest on Loans shall be payable (i) quarterly in arrears on each Quarterly Payment Date, (ii) on the date of any repayment or prepayment (on the amount repaid or prepaid) and (iii) at maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) and, after such maturity, on demand.
		
		
			2.08.Change of Lending Office.  Each Lender agrees that on the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 2.10 or 4.04 with respect to such Lender, it will, if requested by the Borrower, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to designate another lending office for any Loans affected by such event; provided that such designation is made on such terms that such Lender and its lending office suffer no economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, with the object of avoiding the consequence of the event giving rise to the operation of such Section.  Nothing in this Section 2.08 shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of the Borrower or the right of any Lender provided in Section 2.10 or 4.04.
		
		
			2.09.Replacement of Lenders.  (a) If any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, (b) upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 2.10 or 4.04 with respect to any Lender which results in such Lender charging to the Borrower increased costs in excess of those being generally charged by the other Lenders or (c) in the case of a refusal by a Lender to 
		
		  
		consent to a proposed change, waiver, discharge or termination with respect to this Agreement which has been approved by the Required Lenders as (and to the extent) provided in Section 11.12(b), the Borrower shall have the right, subject to Section 11.12(c), in accordance with Section 11.04(b), if no Default or Event of Default then exists or would exist after giving effect to such replacement, to replace such Lender (the “Replaced Lender”) with one or more other Eligible Transferees, none of whom shall constitute a Defaulting Lender at the time of such replacement (collectively, the “Replacement Lender”) and each of which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent; provided that:
		
		
			(A)at the time of any replacement pursuant to this Section 2.09, the Replacement Lender shall enter into one or more Assignment and Assumption Agreements pursuant to Section 11.04(b) (and with all fees payable pursuant to said Section 11.04(b) to be paid by the Borrower) pursuant to which the Replacement Lender shall acquire all of the Commitments (if any) and outstanding Loans of the Replaced Lender and, in connection therewith, shall pay to the Replaced Lender in respect thereof an amount equal to the sum of (x) an amount equal to the principal of, and all accrued and unpaid interest on, all outstanding Loans of the respective Replaced Lender, and (y) an amount equal to all accrued, but theretofore unpaid, Fees owing to the Replaced Lender pursuant to Section 3.01; and
		
		
			(B)all obligations of the Borrower then owing to the Replaced Lender (other than those specifically described in clause (A) above in respect of which the assignment purchase price has been, or is concurrently being, paid) shall be paid in full to such Replaced Lender concurrently with such replacement.
		
		
			Upon receipt by the Replaced Lender of all amounts required to be paid to it pursuant to this Section 2.09, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled (but not obligated) and authorized to execute an Assignment and Assumption Agreement on behalf of such Replaced Lender, and any such Assignment and Assumption Agreement so executed by the Administrative Agent and the Replacement Lender shall be effective for purposes of this Section 2.09 and Section 11.04.  Upon the execution of the respective Assignment and Assumption Agreement, the payment of amounts referred to in clauses (A) and (B) above, recordation of the assignment on the Register by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 11.15 and delivery to the Replacement Lender of the appropriate Note or Notes executed by the Borrower, the Replacement Lender shall become a Lender hereunder and the Replaced Lender shall cease to constitute a Lender hereunder, except with respect to indemnification provisions under this Agreement (including, without limitation, Sections 2.10, 4.04, 10.06, 11.01 and 11.06), which shall survive as to such Replaced Lender.
		
		
			2.10.Capital Adequacy.  (a) If any Lender determines that after the Effective Date the introduction of or any change in any applicable law or governmental rule, regulation, order, guideline, directive or request (whether or not having the force of law) concerning capital adequacy, or any change in interpretation or administration thereof by the NAIC or any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency, will have the effect of increasing the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender based on the existence of such Lender’s Commitment hereunder or its obligations hereunder, then the Borrower agrees to pay to such Lender, upon its written demand therefor, such additional amounts as shall be required to compensate such Lender or such other 
		
		  
		corporation for the increased cost to such Lender or such other corporation or the reduction in the rate of return to such Lender or such other corporation as a result of such increase of capital.  In determining such additional amounts, each Lender will act reasonably and in good faith and will use averaging and attribution methods which are reasonable; provided that such Lender’s determination of compensation owing under this Section 2.10 shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding on all the parties hereto.  Each Lender, upon determining that any additional amounts will be payable pursuant to this Section 2.10, will give prompt written notice thereof to the Borrower, which notice shall show in reasonable detail the basis for calculation of such additional amounts.
		
		
			(b)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (x) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines, requirements and directives thereunder, issued in connection therewith or in implementation thereof and (y) all requests, rules, guidelines or directives promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III shall in each case be deemed to be a change after the Effective Date in a requirement of law or government rule, regulation or order, regardless of the date enacted, adopted, issued or implemented (including for purposes of this Section 2.10).
		
		
			 
		
		
			2.11.Incremental Revolving Loans. (a)  The Borrower may at any time or from time to time after the Syndication Date (or earlier if approved by the Administrative Agent), by notice to the Administrative Agent (whereupon the Administrative Agent shall promptly deliver a copy to each of the Lenders), request one or more increases in the amount of the Commitments, each such increase, a “Commitment Increase”; provided that (i) both at the time of any such request and upon the effectiveness of any Incremental Amendment referred to below, no Default or Event of Default shall exist, (ii) unless otherwise agreed to by the Required Lenders, the Total Commitments shall not exceed $100,000,000 after giving effect to any Commitment Increases, (iii) unless agreed to by the Supermajority Lenders, the Total Commitments shall not exceed $150,000,000 after giving effect to any Commitment Increases and (iv)(1) the aggregate amount of any Commitment Increase pursuant to this Section 2.11 shall not exceed such amount as is equal to the difference of (x) the amount of Indebtedness which is then permitted to be incurred by the Borrower and the other Credit Parties in reliance on Section 4.09(1)(a), (1)(b) or (1)(c) (as applicable) of the Indentures minus (y) the Total Commitments outstanding hereunder immediately prior to such Commitment Increase and (2) the Borrower shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent an Officer’s Certificate certifying, in reasonable detail, as to compliance with the requirements of preceding subclause (iv)(1).  Each Commitment Increase shall be in an aggregate principal amount that is not less than $2,500,000.  Loans made pursuant to any Commitment Increase shall have the same terms and conditions as those applicable to the Loans.  Each notice from the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.11 shall set forth the requested amount of the relevant Commitment Increases.  Commitment Increases may be made by any existing Lender (but no existing Lender will have any obligation to make a portion of any Commitment Increase) or by any other bank or other financial institution that is an Eligible Transferee (any such other bank or other financial institution being called an “Additional Lender”); provided that the Administrative Agent shall have consented (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to such Additional Lender’s providing any such Commitment Increase.

			(b)If, on the date of any increase in the Commitments pursuant to this Section, there are any Loans outstanding, such Loans shall on or prior to the effectiveness of such Commitment Increase be prepaid from the proceeds of additional Loans made hereunder (reflecting such increase in Commitments), which prepayment shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the Loans being prepaid and any costs incurred by any Lender in accordance with Section 2.10. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereby agree that the minimum borrowing, pro rata borrowing and pro rata payment requirements contained elsewhere in this Agreement shall not apply to the transactions effected pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.

			(a)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
		
		
			(i)on the Third Amendment Effective Date, (A) the Non-Extended Loans shall be deemed made as Loans in an amount equal to the principal amount of the Existing Loans converted into Non-Extended Loans pursuant to Section 1(a) of the Third Amendment that were outstanding as Loans at the time of conversion (such Non-Extended Loans to correspond in amount to Existing Loans so converted), and (B) the interest rate applicable to such Non-Extended Loans shall be the same as those applicable to the Existing Loans so converted;

			4.01.Voluntary Prepayments.  The Borrower shall have the right to prepay the Loans, without premium or penalty (except as provided in Sections 3.01(c)), in whole or in part at any time and from time to time on the following terms and conditions: (i) the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent prior to 12:00 Noon (New York City time) at the Notice Office at least three Business Days’ prior written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) of its intent to prepay Loans, which notice shall specify the amount of such prepayment and which notice the Administrative Agent shall, promptly transmit to each of the Lenders; (ii) each partial prepayment of Loans pursuant to this Section 4.01 shall be in an aggregate principal amount of at least $1,000,000 (or such lesser amount as is acceptable to the Administrative Agent); and (iii) 
		
		  
		each prepayment of Loans pursuant to this Section 4.01 shall be applied pro rata among such Loans.
		
		
			4.02.Mandatory Repayments.  
		
		
			(a)  On any day on which the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Loans (with such outstanding Loans to be calculated without regard to any PIK Interest that may have been added to the outstanding principal amount of Loans pursuant to Section 2.07, but after giving effect to all other repayments thereof on such date) exceeds the Total Available Commitment at such time, the Borrower shall repay on such day Loans in an amount equal to such excess.  Any such repayment shall be subject to Section 3.01(c).
		
		
			(b)  In addition to any other mandatory prepayments required pursuant to this Section 4.02, (x) all then outstanding Non-Extended Loans shall be repaid in full on the Maturity Date with respect to the Non-Extended Commitment and (y) all then outstanding Extended Loans shall be repaid in full on the Maturity Date with respect to the Extended Commitment.

			(iii)If a Tax Deduction is required by law to be made by a Credit Party, the amount of the payment due from that Credit Party shall be increased to an amount which (after making any Tax Deduction) leaves an amount equal to the payment which would have been due if no Tax Deduction had been required.

		that the Tax Deduction has been made or (as applicable) any appropriate payment has been paid to the relevant taxing authority.
		
		
			(vi)A Treaty Lender (to the extent it is legally entitled to), and each Credit Party which makes a payment to which that Treaty Lender is entitled, shall use reasonable efforts to co-operate in completing any procedural formalities necessary for that Credit Party to obtain authorization to make that payment without a Tax Deduction. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, a Treaty Lender shall not be required to disclose any information regarding its owners.
		
		
			(vii)Any Lender, if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to United States backup withholding or information reporting requirements. 
		
		
			(b)Tax indemnity.
		
		
			(i)The Borrower shall (within ten Business Days of demand by the Administrative Agent) pay to a Protected Party an amount equal to the loss, liability or cost which that Protected Party determines will be or has been suffered for or on account of Tax by that Protected Party in respect of a Credit Document.
		
		
			(ii)Paragraph (i) above shall not apply: 
		
		
			(A)with respect to any Tax assessed on a Lender or Agent:
		
		
			(1)under the law of the jurisdiction in which that Lender or Agent is incorporated or, if different, the jurisdiction (or jurisdictions) in which that Lender or Agent is treated as resident for tax purposes; or 
		
		
			(2)under the law of the jurisdiction in which that Lender’s lending office is located in respect of amounts received or receivable in that jurisdiction, 
		
		
			if that Tax is imposed on or calculated by reference to the net income received or receivable (but not any sum deemed to be received or receivable) by that Agent or Lender; or
		
		
			(B)to the extent a loss, liability or cost has been compensated for by an increased payment under Section 4.04(a). 
		
		
			(iii)A Protected Party making, or intending to make a claim under paragraph (a) above shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent of the event which will give, or has given, rise to the claim, following which the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower. 
		
		
			(iv)A Protected Party shall, on receiving a payment from a Credit Party under this Section 4.04(b), notify the Administrative Agent.
		
		

		
		  
		(c)Tax Refund.  If a Credit Party makes a Tax Payment and the relevant Lender or Agent determines that: 
		
		
			(i)a Tax Refund is attributable either to an increased payment of which that Tax Payment forms part, or to that Tax Payment; and 
		
		
			(ii)that Lender or Agent has obtained, utilized and retained that Tax Refund, 
		
		
			the Lender or Agent shall pay an amount to the Credit Party which that Lender or Agent reasonably determines will leave it (after that payment) in the same after-Tax position as it would have been in had the Tax Payment not been required to be made by the Credit Party.  Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement or any other Credit Document, nothing in this Section 4.04 shall require a Lender or the Administrative Agent to disclose any confidential information to any Credit Party (including, without limitation, its tax returns or its calculations).
		
		
			(d)Stamp Taxes.  The Borrower shall pay and, within three Business Days of demand, indemnify each Lender and each Agent against any cost, loss or liability that Lender or any Agent incurs in relation to all stamp duty, registration and other similar Taxes payable in respect of any Credit Document.
		
		
			(e)VAT.
		
		
			(i)All amounts set out, or expressed in a Credit Document to be payable by any Credit Party to a Lender or Agent which (in whole or in part) constitute the consideration for a supply or supplies for VAT purposes shall be deemed to be exclusive of any VAT which is chargeable on such supply or supplies, and accordingly, subject to paragraph (ii) below, if VAT is or becomes chargeable on any supply made by any Lender or Agent to any Credit Party under a Credit Document, that Credit Party shall pay to the Lender or Agent (in addition to and at the same time as paying any other consideration for such supply) an amount equal to the amount of such VAT (and such Lender or Agent shall promptly provide an appropriate VAT invoice to such Credit Party).
		
		
			(ii)If VAT is or becomes chargeable on any supply made by any Lender or Agent (the “Supplier”) to any other Lender or Agent (the “Recipient”) under a Credit Document, and any Credit Party other than the Recipient (the “Subject Party”) is required by the terms of any Credit Document to pay an amount equal to the consideration for such supply to the Supplier (rather than being required to reimburse the Recipient in respect of that consideration), such Credit Party shall also pay to the Supplier (in addition to and at the same time as paying such amount) an amount equal to the amount of such VAT.  The Recipient will promptly pay to the Subject Party an amount equal to any credit or repayment obtained by the Recipient from the relevant tax authority which the Recipient reasonably determines in respect of such VAT.
		
		
			(iii)Where a Credit Document requires any Credit Party to reimburse or indemnify a Lender or Agent for any cost or expense, the Credit Party shall reimburse or indemnify (as the case may be) such Lender or Agent for the full amount of such cost or expense, including such part thereof as represents VAT, save to the extent that such Lender or Agent reasonably determines that it is entitled to credit or repayment in respect of such VAT from the relevant tax authority.
		
		

		
		  
		(iv)Any reference in this Section 4.04(e) to any Credit Party shall, at any time when such Credit Party is treated as a member of a group for VAT purposes, include (where appropriate and unless the context otherwise requires) a reference to the representative member of such group at such time (the term “representative member” to have the same meaning as in the Value Added Tax Act 1994).

			(b)No part of the proceeds of any Loan will be used to purchase or carry any Margin Stock or to extend credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any Margin Stock.  Neither the making of any Loan nor the use of the proceeds thereof will violate or be inconsistent with the provisions of Regulation T, U or X.

			(5)the incurrence by Holdings or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness represented by Capital Lease Obligations, mortgage financings or purchase money obligations, in each case incurred for the purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price or cost of design, installation, repair, replacement, construction or improvement of property, plant or equipment used in the business of Holdings or such Restricted Subsidiary (whether through the direct purchase of such assets or the Capital Stock of any Person owning such assets (but no other material assets)) and related financing costs, and Attributable Debt in respect of Sale Leaseback Transactions, including all Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to extend, refinance, renew, replace, defease, discharge, refund or otherwise retire for value any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (5), provided that after giving effect to any such incurrence, the aggregate principal amount of all Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (5) and then outstanding does not exceed the greater of (a) $25,000,000 and (b) 2.0% of Holdings’ Adjusted Consolidated Net Tangible Assets determined as of the date of such incurrence;
		
		
			(6)the incurrence by Holdings or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness in exchange for, or the net proceeds of which shall be used to extend, refinance, renew, replace, defease, discharge, refund or otherwise retire for value, in whole or in part, Indebtedness of Holdings or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (other than intercompany Indebtedness) or Disqualified Stock of Holdings, in each case that was permitted by this Agreement to be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this Section 8.03 or clauses (3) (other than in respect of Indebtedness under the Existing Credit Agreement), (4) and (13) of this paragraph or this clause (6);
		
		

		
		  
		(7)the incurrence by Holdings or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of intercompany Indebtedness between or among any of Holdings and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; provided, however, that:
		
		
			(a)if any Credit Party is the obligor on such Indebtedness, such Indebtedness must be expressly subordinated to the prior payment in full in cash of all Obligations; and
		
		
			(b)(i) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Equity Interests that results in any such Indebtedness being held by a Person other than Holdings or a Restricted Subsidiary of Holdings and (ii) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person that is neither Holdings nor a Restricted Subsidiary of Holdings shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an incurrence (as of the date of such issuance, sale or transfer) of such Indebtedness by Holdings or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, that was not permitted by this clause (7); 
		
		
			(8)the incurrence by Holdings or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of obligations under Hedging Agreements;
		
		
			(9)(a) the guarantee by Holdings or any other Credit Party of Indebtedness of Holdings or any other Credit Party that was permitted to be incurred by the first paragraph of this Section 8.03; provided that if the Indebtedness being guaranteed is subordinated to the Obligations, then the Guaranty of Holdings or such other Credit Party (or, in the case of a guarantee made by the Borrower, the Borrower’s Obligations hereunder) shall be senior to its guarantee of such subordinated Indebtedness; and (b) the guarantee by Holdings or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness of Holdings or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that was permitted to be incurred by another provision of this Section 8.03 other than the first paragraph hereof; provided that if the Indebtedness being guaranteed is subordinated to the Obligations, then the Guaranty of Holdings or such other Credit Party (or, in the case of a guarantee made by the Borrower, the Borrower’s Obligations hereunder), if it is a Guarantor, shall be senior to its guarantee of such subordinated Indebtedness;
		
		
			(10)the incurrence by Holdings or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness relating to net gas balancing positions arising in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice;
		
		
			(11)the incurrence by Holdings or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness in respect of bid, performance, surety, appeal and similar bonds issued for the account of Holdings and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, or obligations in respect of letters of credit posted in lieu of, or to secure, any such bonds, in the ordinary course of business or which are customary in the Oil and Gas Business; provided that the aggregate outstanding amount of all such bid, performance, surety, appeal and similar bonds permitted by this clause (11) shall not at any time exceed $150,000,000; provided that all Indebtedness under this clause (11) shall be unsecured except as permitted under clause (8) of the definition of Permitted Liens contained herein;
		
		
			(12)the issuance by any of Holdings’ Restricted Subsidiaries to Holdings or to any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of any preferred securities; provided, however, that:
		
		
			(a)any subsequent issuance or transfer of Equity Interests that results in any such preferred securities being held by a Person other than Holdings or a Restricted Subsidiary of Holdings; and
		
		

		
		  
		(b)any sale or other transfer of any such preferred securities to a Person that is not either Holdings or a Restricted Subsidiary of Holdings shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an issuance (as of the date of such issuance, sale or transfer) of such preferred securities by such Restricted Subsidiary that was not permitted by this clause (12);
		
		
			(13)Permitted Acquisition Indebtedness;
		
		
			(14)the incurrence by Holdings or its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness arising from the honoring by a bank or other financial institution of a check, draft or similar instrument inadvertently drawn against insufficient funds in the ordinary course of business, so long as such Indebtedness is covered within five Business Days;
		
		
			(15)the incurrence by Holdings or its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness consisting of the financing of insurance premiums in customary amounts consistent with the operations and business of Holdings and the Restricted Subsidiaries;
		
		
			(16)the incurrence of Indebtedness pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement;
		
		
			(17)the incurrence of Indebtedness pursuant to the Smedvig Reimbursement Agreement; and
		
		
			(18)the incurrence by Holdings or any other Credit Party of additional Indebtedness or the issuance by Holdings of additional Disqualified Stock, provided that, after giving effect to any such incurrence or issuance, the aggregate principal amount of all Indebtedness and Disqualified Stock incurred or issued under this clause (16) and then outstanding does not exceed the greater of (a) $75,000,000 and (b) 5.0% of Holdings’ Adjusted Consolidated Net Tangible Assets determined as of the date of such incurrence or issuance.
		
		
			Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, Holdings shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to (and the provisions of this Section 8.03 shall not permit Holdings or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to), incur any Indebtedness for borrowed money having a maturity date occurring on or prior to the Maturity Date of the Extended Commitments (determined disregarding the proviso contained therein).
		
		
			For purposes of determining compliance with this Section 8.03, in the event that an item of Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock or preferred securities meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses (1) through (16) above, or is entitled to be incurred or issued pursuant to the first paragraph of this Section 8.03, Holdings will be permitted to divide and classify (or later classify, reclassify or re-divide in whole or in part in its sole discretion) such item of Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock or preferred securities in any manner that complies with this Section 8.03; provided that (a) Indebtedness under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents shall be considered to have been incurred under clause (1) above and (b) Indebtedness under the Existing Credit Agreement shall be considered to have been incurred under clause (3) above.  For purposes of determining any particular amount of Indebtedness under this covenant, guarantees of Indebtedness otherwise included in the determination of such amount shall not also be included except to the extent that such Indebtedness exceeds such guarantee.
		
		

		
		  
		The accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest on any Indebtedness in the form of additional Indebtedness and the payment of dividends on Disqualified Stock or preferred securities in the form of additional shares of Disqualified Stock or preferred securities will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness or an issuance of Disqualified Stock or preferred securities for purposes of this Section 8.03.
		
		
			For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency will be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date the Indebtedness was incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit Indebtedness; provided that if such Indebtedness is incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and the refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-dominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of the refinancing, such U.S. dollar-dominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced (plus all accrued and unpaid interest on such Indebtedness, and the amount of all fees, expenses and premiums incurred in connection therewith).  Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that Holdings or any Restricted Subsidiary may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies.  The principal amount of any Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, will be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which the Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.
		
		
			8.04.Limitation on Asset Sales.  Holdings will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, consummate an Asset Sale unless:
		
		
			(1)Holdings (or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives consideration at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the assets or Equity Interest issued or sold or otherwise disposed of; and
		
		
			(2)at least 75% of the aggregate consideration to be received by Holdings and its Restricted Subsidiaries in such Asset Sale (determined on the date of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale) and any other Asset Sale since the date of this Agreement, on a cumulative basis, is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents.  For purposes of this provision, each of the following will be deemed to be cash:
		
		
			(a)any liabilities, as shown on Holdings’ or any Restricted Subsidiary’s most recent balance sheet, of Holdings or such Restricted Subsidiary (other than contingent liabilities and liabilities that are by their terms subordinated in right of payment to the Obligations) that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets pursuant to a customary novation agreement that releases Holdings or such Restricted Subsidiary from further liability; and
		
		

		
		  
		(b)any securities, notes or other obligations received by Holdings or any Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are, within 90 days after the Asset Sale, converted by Holdings or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents, to the extent of the cash received in that conversion,
		
		
			provided that in the case of any Asset Sale pursuant to a condemnation, appropriation or similar governmental taking, including by deed in lieu of condemnation, such Asset Sale shall not be required to satisfy the requirements of items (1) and (2) above.  Notwithstanding the preceding, the 75% limitation referred to above shall be deemed satisfied with respect to any Asset Sale to which such limitation applies in which the cash or Cash Equivalents portion of the consideration received therefrom, determined in accordance with the preceding provision on an after-tax basis, is equal to or greater than what the after-tax proceeds would have been had such Asset Sale complied with the aforementioned 75% limitation.
		
		
			Within 365 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale, Holdings (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) may apply those Net Proceeds at its option to any combination of the following:
		
		
			(1)prior to the Escrow Release Date, to permanently prepay or repay Indebtedness outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof;
		
		
			(2)to repay any Loans or other Obligations then outstanding hereunder;
		
		
			(3)with the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (unless such Net Proceeds are from Asset Sales of Indenture Collateral, in which case such consent shall not be required), to permanently prepay, repay, redeem, defease or purchase the Indenture Notes or any other Indebtedness of Holdings or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries permitted to be incurred under the terms of this Agreement and, in each case, any obligations with respect thereto (subject to limitations in Section 8.01); provided that (a) Indebtedness permitted to be prepaid, repaid, redeemed, defeased or purchased pursuant to this clause (3) shall in no circumstances include (x) Indebtedness described in preceding clauses (1) or (2), (y) any intercompany Indebtedness of Holdings or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to Holdings or any of its Affiliates or (z) any trade payables or taxes owed or owing by Holdings or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries and (b) the aggregate  amount of all prepayments, repayments, redemptions, defeasances or purchases pursuant to this clause (3) from and after the Effective Date (other than with Net Proceeds of Asset Sales of Indenture Collateral) shall not exceed an amount equal to (A) $35,000,000, less (B) the aggregate amount of all payments, purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions or retirements made in reliance on Section 8.01(5)(c)(ii) and Section 8.01(3)(c) plus (C) the aggregate amount of Commitment reductions that are rejected by the Lenders pursuant to the third succeeding paragraph (it being understood that any such prepayments, redemptions, defeasances or purchases pursuant to this sub-clause (C) shall be subject to the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent);
		
		
			(4)subject to compliance with the Additional Guarantor Requirement as of the date of such investment, to invest in or acquire Additional Assets; or
		
		

		
		  
		(5)to make capital expenditures in respect of Holdings’ or its Restricted Subsidiaries’ Oil and Gas Business.
		
		
			The requirement of clause (4) or (5) immediately above shall be deemed to be satisfied if a bona fide binding contract committing to make the investment, acquisition or expenditure referred to therein is entered into by Holdings or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries with a Person other than an Affiliate of Holdings within the time period specified above in this paragraph and such Net Proceeds are subsequently applied in accordance with such contract within six months following the date such agreement is entered into.
		
		
			Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds, Holdings or any Restricted Subsidiary of Holdings may invest the Net Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by this Agreement.  “Excess Proceeds” shall mean any and all Net Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in the second preceding paragraph.
		
		
			On the 366th day after an Asset Sale (or, at Holdings’s option, any earlier date), if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds then exceeds $10,000,000, the Total Commitment shall be reduced by the amount of such Excess Proceeds in accordance with this paragraph.  The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent in writing of any reduction in the Total Commitment required to be made pursuant to the preceding sentence at least (5) five Business Days prior to the date of such reduction.  Each such notice shall specify the date of such reduction and provide a reasonably detailed calculation of the amount of such reduction.  The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender of the contents of the Borrower’s Commitment reduction notice and of such Lender’s pro rata share of the Commitment reduction.  Each Lender may reject all or a portion of its pro rata share of any such Commitment reduction by providing written notice (each, a “Rejection Notice”) to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower no later than 5:00 p.m. one (1) Business Day after the date of such Lender’s receipt of notice from the Administrative Agent regarding such Commitment reduction.  Each Rejection Notice from a given Lender shall specify the principal amount of the Commitment reduction to be rejected by such Lender.  If a Lender fails to deliver a Rejection Notice to the Administrative Agent within the time frame specified above or such Rejection Notice fails to specify the principal amount of the Loans to be rejected, any such failure will be deemed an acceptance of the total amount of such Commitment reduction.
		
		
			If, on the date of any reduction in the Commitments pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph in respect of which one or more Rejection Notices have been delivered, there are any Loans outstanding, such Loans shall on or prior to the effectiveness of such Commitment decrease be prepaid from the proceeds of additional Loans made hereunder (reflecting such decrease in Commitments), which prepayment shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the Loans being prepaid and any costs incurred by any Lender in accordance with Section 2.10. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereby agree that the minimum borrowing, pro rata borrowing and pro rata payment requirements contained elsewhere in this Agreement shall not apply to the transactions effected pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.
		
		
			8.05.Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates.  Holdings will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any payment to, or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any properties or assets from, or enter into or 
		
		  
		make or amend any transaction, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of Holdings (each, an “Affiliate Transaction”), unless:
		
		
			(1)the Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are not less favorable to Holdings or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by Holdings or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person or, if in the good faith judgment of Holdings’ Board of Directors, no comparable transaction is available with which to compare such Affiliate Transaction, such Affiliate Transaction is otherwise fair to Holdings or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view; and
		
		
			(2)Holdings delivers to the Administrative Agent:
		
		
			(a)with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate consideration to or from an Affiliate in excess of $10,000,000, a resolution of the Board of Directors of Holdings set forth in an Officers’ Certificate certifying that such Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions complies with this Section 8.05 and that such Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions has been approved by a majority of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors of Holdings; and
		
		
			(b)with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate consideration to or from an Affiliate in excess of $20,000,000, an opinion as to the fairness to Holdings or such Restricted Subsidiary of such Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions from a financial point of view issued by an accounting, appraisal or investment banking firm of national standing.
		
		
			The following items will not be deemed to be Affiliate Transactions and, therefore, will not be subject to the provisions of the prior paragraph of this Section 8.05:
		
		
			(1)any employment agreement or arrangement, equity award, equity option or cash or equity settled equity appreciation agreement or plan, employee benefit plan, officer or director indemnification agreement, severance agreement, consulting agreement or other compensation plan or arrangement entered into by Holdings or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business or which is customary in the Oil and Gas Business, and payments, awards, grants or issuances of securities pursuant thereto;
		
		
			(2)transactions between or among any of Holdings and its Restricted Subsidiaries;
		
		
			(3)transactions with a Person (other than an Unrestricted Subsidiary of Holdings) that is an Affiliate of Holdings solely because Holdings owns, directly or indirectly, an Equity Interest in, or otherwise controls, such Person or has nominated or appointed a person to the Board of Directors of that Person;
		
		
			(4)customary compensation, indemnification and other benefits made available to officers, directors, employees or consultants of Holdings or a Restricted Subsidiary of Holdings, including reimbursement or advancement of out-of-pocket expenses and provisions of officers’ and directors’ liability insurance;
		
		

		
		  
		(5)issuances of Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of Holdings to, or receipt of capital contributions from, Affiliates of Holdings and any dividend or distribution payable in Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of Holdings;
		
		
			(6)any Permitted Investments or Restricted Payments that are permitted by Section 8.01;
		
		
			(7)transactions between Holdings or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries and any Person that would not otherwise constitute an Affiliate Transaction except for the fact that one director of such other Person is also a director of Holdings or such Restricted Subsidiary, as applicable; provided that such director abstains from voting as a director of Holdings or such Restricted Subsidiary, as applicable, on any matter involving such other Person;
		
		
			(8)the existence of, and the performance of obligations of Holdings or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries under the terms of, any written agreement to which Holdings or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is a party on the date of this Agreement, as such agreements may be amended, modified, supplemented or replaced from time to time; provided, however, that any amendment, modification, supplement or replacement entered into after the date of this Agreement will be permitted to the extent that its terms are not materially more disadvantageous, taken as a whole, to the Lenders than the terms of the agreements in effect on the date of this Agreement (as conclusively evidenced by a Board Resolution of Holdings or such Subsidiary);
		
		
			(9)any transaction in which Holdings or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, delivers to the Administrative Agent an opinion from an accounting, appraisal or investment banking firm of national standing stating that such transaction is fair to Holdings or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or that such transaction meets the requirements of clause (1) of the preceding paragraph of this Section 8.05; 
		
		
			(10)(a) guarantees by Holdings or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of performance of obligations of Holdings’ Unrestricted Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business or which are customary in the Oil and Gas Business and (b) pledges by Holdings or any Restricted Subsidiary of Holdings of Equity Interests in Unrestricted Subsidiaries for the benefit of lenders or other creditors of Holdings’ Unrestricted Subsidiaries; 
		
		
			(11)any Affiliate Transaction with a Person in its capacity as a holder of Indebtedness or Capital Stock of Holdings or any Restricted Subsidiary of Holdings if such Person is treated no more favorably than the other holders of Indebtedness or Capital Stock of Holdings or such Restricted Subsidiary; 
		
		
			(12)transactions with joint venture partners, customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, or lessors or lessees of property, in each case in the ordinary course of business or which are customary in the Oil and Gas Business and otherwise in compliance with the terms of this Agreement similar to those contained in similar contracts entered into by Holdings or any Restricted Subsidiary and unrelated third parties, or if neither Holdings nor any Restricted Subsidiary has entered into a similar contract with an unrelated third party, which are, in the aggregate (taking into account all the costs and benefits associated with such transactions), not materially less favorable to Holdings and its Restricted Subsidiaries than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by Holdings or such Restricted Subsidiary with 
		
		  
		an unrelated third party, in the good faith determination of Holdings’ Board of Directors or any executive officer of Holdings involved in or otherwise familiar with such transaction; and
		
		
			(13)dividends and distributions to Holdings and its Restricted Subsidiaries by any Unrestricted Subsidiary.
		
		
			8.06.Limitation on Liens.  Holdings will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, create, incur, assume or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective (a) any Lien of any kind (other than Permitted Liens) securing Indebtedness upon any of their property or assets other than the Designated Collateral (whether now owned or hereafter acquired), unless the Obligations of the Borrower or (in the case of such a Lien with respect to a Guarantor) the Applicable Guaranty are secured on an equal and ratable basis with (or, if such Lien secures obligations subordinated in right of payment to the Obligations of the Borrower or such Guaranty, on a basis senior (to at least the same extent as the Obligations of the Borrower or such Guaranty are senior in right of payment) to) the obligations so secured until such time as such obligations are no longer secured by a Lien, (b) any Lien of any kind securing Indebtedness upon any of the Indenture Collateral (whether now owned or hereafter acquired), other than the Indenture Notes or (c) any Lien of any kind (other than Permitted Liens) securing Indebtedness upon the Collateral. 
		
		
			Any Lien on any property or assets of Holdings or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries created for the benefit of the Secured Creditors pursuant to clause (a) of the preceding paragraph shall provide by its terms that such Lien shall, except to the extent that such property or assets are subject to a Lien created for the benefit of the Secured Creditors in accordance with Section 7.12 (in which case such property and assets shall be subject to clause (c) of the preceding paragraph), be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged at such time as there are no other Liens of any kind (other than Permitted Liens) on such property or assets securing Indebtedness.
		
		
			8.07.Business Activities.  Holdings shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, engage in any business other than the Oil and Gas Business, except to such extent as would not be material to Holdings and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole.
		
		
			8.08.Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries.  The Board of Directors of Holdings may designate any Restricted Subsidiary of Holdings (other than the Borrower) to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation would not cause a Default or Event of Default and the other requirements for such designation prescribed in the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary” are satisfied.  If a Restricted Subsidiary of Holdings is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate Fair Market Value of all outstanding Investments owned by Holdings and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary properly designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under the first paragraph of Section 8.01 or represent Permitted Investments, as determined by Holdings.  That designation shall only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Subsidiary so designated otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary.
		
		
			The Board of Directors of Holdings may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary of Holdings to be a Restricted Subsidiary of Holdings, provided that such designation will be 
		
		  
		deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of Holdings of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is permitted under Section 8.03, calculated on a pro forma basis as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the four-quarter reference period, and (2) no Default (other than a Reporting Default) or Event of Default would be in existence following such designation.
		
		
			8.09.Merger, Consolidation, or Sale of Assets.  Neither Holdings nor the Borrower may: (x) consolidate or merge with or into another Person (whether or not Holdings or the Borrower (as applicable) is the survivor), convert into another form of entity or continue in another jurisdiction; or (y) directly or indirectly, sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or assets, in one or more related transactions to another Person, unless:
		
		
			(a)either (1) Holdings or the Borrower (as applicable) is the survivor or (2) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger or resulting from such conversion (if other than Holdings or the Borrower) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition shall have been made is a corporation, limited liability company or limited partnership organized or existing under the laws of the United States, any state of the United States or the District of Columbia or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation involving the Borrower, or any sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition of assets of the Borrower, organized or existing under the laws of England and Wales (Holdings, the Borrower or such other Person, as the case may be, being herein called the “Successor Company”);
		
		
			(b)the Successor Company unconditionally assumes all the obligations of Holdings or the Borrower (as applicable) under this Agreement, the Security Documents and any and all other Credit Documents to which it is a party pursuant to a joinder agreement or other agreement in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent;
		
		
			(c)immediately after such transaction or transactions, no Default (other than a Reporting Default) or Event of Default exists;
		
		
			(d)either
		
		
			(i)the Successor Company would, on the date of such transaction immediately after giving pro forma effect thereto and any related financing transactions as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, be permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in the first paragraph of Section 8.03 hereof; or
		
		
			(ii)immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction and any related financing transactions as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Successor Company, will be equal to or greater than the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of Holdings immediately prior to such transaction; 
		
		
			(e)the Successor Company causes such amendments, supplements or other instruments to be executed, delivered, filed and recorded, as applicable, in such jurisdictions as may be required by 
		
		  
		applicable law or desired by the Collateral Agent to preserve and protect the Lien of the Security Documents on any Collateral owned by or transferred to the Successor Company;
		
		
			(f)any Collateral owned by or transferred to the Successor Company shall (1) continue to constitute Collateral, (2) be subject to a first-priority Lien in favor of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Creditors and (3) not be subject to any Lien other than the Liens securing the Obligations and other Permitted Liens; and
		
		
			(g)the property and assets of the Person which is merged or consolidated with or into the Successor Company, to the extent that they are property or assets of the types which would constitute Collateral, shall be treated as after-acquired property and the Successor Company shall take such action as may be reasonably necessary or desired by the Collateral Agent to cause such property and assets to be made subject to a first-priority Lien in favor of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Creditors.
		
		
			Notwithstanding the restrictions described in the foregoing clause (d), (x) any Restricted Subsidiary of Holdings (other than the Borrower) may consolidate with, merge into or dispose of all or part of its properties or assets to Holdings or another Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, subject to compliance with the Additional Guarantor Requirement as of the time of such merger or disposition, and (y) Holdings may merge with or into an Affiliate formed solely for the purpose of reincorporating Holdings in another jurisdiction.
		
		
			For purposes of the foregoing, the sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition (in a single transaction or series of transactions) of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of one or more Subsidiaries of Holdings, which properties or assets, if held by Holdings instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties or assets of Holdings on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of Holdings.
		
		
			8.10.Elections.  Without the prior written consent of the Required Lenders, Holdings will not, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, make any election for U.S. federal income tax purposes that causes the Indebtedness of the Borrower to be treated as the Indebtedness of a “U.S. person” (as such term is defined under Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

			(b)To the full extent permitted by applicable law, each of Holdings and the Borrower shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnified Person, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or incidental damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Credit Document,  any other agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof.  No Indemnified Person shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials distributed by it through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement or the other Credit Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, except to the extent the liability of such Indemnified Person results from such Indemnified Person’s gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non appealable decision).
		
		
			11.02.Right of Setoff.  In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under applicable law or otherwise, and not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent and each Lender is hereby authorized at any time or from time to time, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind to any Credit Party or to any other Person, any such notice being hereby expressly waived, to set off and to appropriate and apply any and all deposits (general or special) and any other Indebtedness at any time held or owing by the Administrative Agent or such Lender or any Affiliate, branch or agency thereof (including, without limitation, by branches and agencies of the Administrative Agent or such Lender or Affiliate wherever located) to or for the credit or the account of Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries against and on account of the Obligations and liabilities of the Credit Parties to the Administrative Agent or such Lender under this Agreement or under any of the other Credit Documents, including, without limitation, all interests in Obligations purchased by such Lender pursuant to Section 11.04(b), and all other claims of any nature or description arising out of or connected with this Agreement or any other Credit Document, irrespective of whether or not the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall have made any demand hereunder and although said Obligations, liabilities or claims, or any of them, shall be contingent or unmatured.

			11.04.Benefit of Agreement; Assignments; Participations.  (a)  This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the respective successors and assigns of the parties hereto; provided, however, that neither Holdings nor the Borrower may assign or transfer any of its rights, obligations or interest hereunder without the prior written consent of the Lenders and, provided further, that, although any Lender may transfer, assign or grant participations in its rights hereunder, such Lender shall remain a “Lender” for all purposes hereunder (and may not transfer or assign all or any portion of its Commitment or any related Obligations hereunder except as provided in Sections 2.09 and 11.04(b)) and the transferee, assignee or participant, as the case may be, shall not constitute a “Lender” hereunder and, provided further, that no Lender shall transfer or grant any participation under which the participant shall have rights to approve any amendment to or waiver of this Agreement or any other Credit Document except to the extent such amendment or waiver would (i) extend the final scheduled maturity of any Loan or Note in which such participant is participating, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest or Fees thereon (except in connection with a waiver of applicability of any post-default increase in interest rates) or reduce the principal amount thereof, or increase the amount of the participant’s participation over the amount thereof then in effect (it being understood that a waiver of any Default or Event of Default or of a mandatory reduction in the Total Commitment shall not constitute a change in the terms of such participation, and that an increase in any Commitment (or the available portion thereof) or Loan shall be permitted without the consent of any participant if the participant’s participation is not increased as a result thereof), (ii) consent to the assignment or transfer by Holdings or the Borrower of any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement or (iii) release all or substantially all of the Collateral under all of the Security Documents (except as expressly provided in the Credit Documents) supporting the Loans hereunder in which such participant is participating.  In the case of any such participation, the participant shall not have any rights under this Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents (the participant’s rights against such Lender in respect of such participation to be those set forth in the agreement executed by such Lender in favor of the participant relating thereto) and all amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participation.
		
		

		
		  
		(b)Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Lender (or any Lender together with one or more other Lenders) may (x) assign all or a portion of its Commitments (including any Non-Extended Commitment or Extended Commitment) and related outstanding Obligations (or, if the Commitments have terminated, outstanding Obligations) hereunder to (i) (A) its parent company and/or any affiliate of such Lender which is at least 50% owned by such Lender or its parent company or (B) to one or more other Lenders or any affiliate of any such other Lender which is at least 50% owned by such other Lender or its parent company (provided that any fund that invests in loans and is managed or advised by the same investment advisor of another fund which is a Lender (or by an Affiliate of such investment advisor) shall be treated as an affiliate of such other Lender for the purposes of this sub-clause (x)(i)(B)), or (ii) in the case of any Lender that is a fund that invests in loans, any other fund that invests in loans and is managed or advised by the same investment advisor of any Lender or by an Affiliate of such investment advisor; provided that, in no event shall any assignment of Commitments or Loans pursuant to this clause (x) be made to Holdings, the Borrower or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or (y) assign all, or if less than all, a portion equal to at least $5,000,000 in the aggregate for the assigning Lender or assigning Lenders, of such Commitment and related outstanding Obligations (or, if the Commitment has terminated, outstanding Obligations) hereunder to one or more Eligible Transferees (treating any fund that invests in loans and any other fund that invests in loans and is managed or advised by the same investment advisor of such fund or by an Affiliate of such investment advisor as a single Eligible Transferee), each of which assignees shall become a party to this Agreement as a Lender by execution of an Assignment and Assumption Agreement, provided that (i) at such time, Schedule 1.01(b) shall be deemed modified to reflect the Commitments and/or outstanding Loans, as the case may be, of such new Lender and of the existing Lenders, (ii) upon the surrender of the relevant Notes by the assigning Lender (or, upon such assigning Lender’s indemnifying the Borrower for any lost Note pursuant to a customary indemnification agreement) new Notes will be issued, at the Borrower’s expense, to such new Lender and to the assigning Lender, such new Notes to be in conformity with the requirements of Section 2.05 (with appropriate modifications) to the extent needed to reflect the revised Commitments and/or outstanding Loans, as the case may be, (iii) the consent of the Administrative Agent and after the Syndication Date, so long as no Default or Event of Default then exists, the Borrower, shall be required in connection with any such assignment pursuant to clause (y) above (such consent, in any case, not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned); provided that the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within 5 Business Days after having received notice thereof, (iv) the Administrative Agent shall receive at the time of each such assignment, from the assigning or assignee Lender, the payment of a non-refundable assignment fee of $3,500 and (v) no such transfer or assignment will be effective until recorded by the Administrative Agent on the Register pursuant to Section 11.15.  To the extent of any assignment pursuant to this Section 11.04(b), the assigning Lender shall be relieved of its obligations hereunder with respect to its assigned Commitment and outstanding Loans.  To the extent that an assignment of all or any portion of a Lender’s Commitment and related outstanding Obligations pursuant to Section 2.09 or this Section 11.04(b), would, at the time of such assignment, result in increased costs under Section 2.10 from those being charged by the respective assigning Lender prior to such assignment, then the Borrower shall not be obligated to pay such increased costs (although the Borrower, in accordance with and pursuant to the other 
		
		  
		provisions of this Agreement, shall be obligated to pay any other increased costs of the type described above resulting from changes after the date of the respective assignment).
		
		
			(c)Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or prohibit any Lender from pledging its Loans and Notes hereunder to a Federal Reserve Bank in support of borrowings made by such Lender from such Federal Reserve Bank and, with prior notification to the Administrative Agent (but without the consent of the Administrative Agent or the Borrower), any Lender which is a fund may pledge all or any portion of its Loans and Notes to its trustee or to a collateral agent or financial institution providing credit or credit support to such Lender in support of its obligations to such trustee, such collateral agent or such financial institution, as the case may be.  No pledge pursuant to this clause (c) shall release the transferor Lender from any of its obligations hereunder.
		
		
			(d)Any Lender which assigns all of its Commitments and/or Loans hereunder in accordance with Section 11.04(b) shall cease to constitute a “Lender” hereunder, except with respect to indemnification provisions under this Agreement (including, without limitation, Sections 4.04, 10.06, 11.01 and 11.06), which shall survive as to such assigning Lender.
		
		
			11.05.No Waiver; Remedies Cumulative.  No failure or delay on the part of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Credit Document and no course of dealing between the Borrower or any other Credit Party and the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Credit Document preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder or thereunder.  The rights, powers and remedies herein or in any other Credit Document expressly provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, powers or remedies which the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender would otherwise have.  No notice to or demand on any Credit Party in any case shall entitle any Credit Party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender to any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand.
		
		
			11.06.Payments Pro Rata.  (a)  Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement (including in Section 8.04), the Administrative Agent agrees that promptly after its receipt of each payment from or on behalf of the Borrower in respect of any Obligations hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Lenders entitled thereto (other than any Lender that has consented in writing to waive its pro rata share of any such payment) pro rata based upon their respective shares, if any, of the Obligations with respect to which such payment was received.
		
		
			(b)Each of the Lenders agrees that, if it should receive any amount hereunder (whether by voluntary payment, by realization upon security, by the exercise of the right of setoff or banker’s lien, by counterclaim or cross action, by the enforcement of any right under the Credit Documents, or otherwise), which is applicable to the payment of the principal of, or interest on, the Loans, of a sum which with respect to the related sum or sums received by other Lenders is in a greater proportion than the total of such Obligation then owed and due to such Lender bears to the total of such Obligation then owed and due to all of the Lenders immediately prior to such 
		
		  
		receipt, then such Lender receiving such excess payment shall purchase for cash without recourse or warranty from the other Lenders an interest in the Obligations of the respective Credit Party to such Lenders in such amount as shall result in a proportional participation by all the Lenders in such amount; provided that if all or any portion of such excess amount is thereafter recovered from such Lenders, such purchase shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, but without interest.
		
		
			(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the provisions of the preceding Sections 11.06(a) and (b) shall be subject to the express provisions of this Agreement which require, or permit, differing payments to be made to Non-Defaulting Lenders as opposed to Defaulting Lenders.
		
		
			11.07.Calculations; Computations.  (a)  All accounting determinations under this Agreement and all financial statements to be furnished to the Lenders pursuant hereto shall be made and prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied throughout the periods involved (except as set forth in the notes thereto or as otherwise disclosed in writing by Holdings to the Lenders); provided that, to the extent expressly provided herein, certain calculations shall be made on a pro forma basis.  Holdings, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Lenders, agree that in the event of any material change in GAAP (any such change, for the purpose of this Section 11.07, an “Accounting Change”) that occurs after the date of this Agreement, then following the written request of either the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall enter into good faith negotiations in order to amend such provisions of this Agreement so as to equitably reflect any such Accounting Change with the desired result that the criteria for evaluating the financial condition of Holdings and its Subsidiaries shall be the same after such Accounting Change as if such Accounting Change had not been made, and until such time as such an amendment shall have been executed and delivered by Holdings, the Borrower and Required Lenders, (a) all financial ratios, standards and terms in this Agreement shall be calculated and/or construed as if such Accounting Change had not been made, and (b) the Borrower shall prepare footnotes to each certificate and the financial statements required to be delivered pursuant to Sections 7.01(b), (c), and (g) hereunder that show the differences between the financial statements delivered (which reflect such Accounting Change) and the basis for calculating compliance with incurrence based financial covenants (without reflecting such Accounting Change).
		
		
			(b)All computations of interest, Commitment Commission and other Fees hereunder shall be made on the basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest, Commitment Commission or Fees are payable.
		
		
			(c)For purposes of any computation determining compliance with any incurrence or expenditure tests set forth in Sections 1 and/or 8 or with Dollar-based basket levels appearing in any definitions contained in Section 1.01, any amounts so incurred, expended or utilized (to the extent incurred, expended or utilized in a currency other than Dollars) shall be converted into Dollars on the basis of the Exchange Rates as in effect on the date of such incurrence, expenditure or utilization under any provision of any such Section or definition that has an aggregate Dollar limitation provided for therein (and to the extent the respective incurrence, expenditure or utilization test regulates the aggregate amount outstanding at any time and it is 
		
		  
		expressed in terms of Dollars, all outstanding amounts originally incurred or spent in currencies other than Dollars shall be converted into Dollars on the basis of the Exchange Rates as in effect on the date of any new incurrence, expenditure or utilization made under any provision of any such Section that regulates the Dollar amount outstanding at any time).
		
		
			11.08.GOVERNING LAW; SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION; VENUE; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.  (a)  THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENTS AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER AND THEREUNDER SHALL, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THE RELEVANT SECURITY DOCUMENT BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND BE GOVERNED BY THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK (WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES).  ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENT MAY BE BROUGHT IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK OR OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, IN EACH CASE WHICH ARE LOCATED IN THE COUNTY OF NEW YORK (EXCEPT THAT, (X) IN THE CASE OF ANY SECURITY DOCUMENT, PROCEEDINGS MAY ALSO BE BROUGHT BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR COLLATERAL AGENT IN THE STATE IN WHICH THE RESPECTIVE COLLATERAL IS LOCATED OR ANY OTHER RELEVANT JURISDICTION AND (Y) IN THE CASE OF ANY BANKRUPTCY, INSOLVENCY OR SIMILAR PROCEEDINGS WITH RESPECT TO ANY CREDIT PARTY, ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENTS MAY BE BROUGHT IN SUCH COURT HOLDING SUCH BANKRUPTCY, INSOLVENCY OR SIMILAR PROCEEDINGS) AND, BY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENT, EACH OF HOLDINGS AND THE BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY ACCEPTS FOR ITSELF AND IN RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY, GENERALLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY, THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE AFORESAID COURTS.  EACH OF HOLDINGS AND THE BORROWER HEREBY FURTHER IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY CLAIM THAT ANY SUCH COURTS LACK PERSONAL JURISDICTION OVER HOLDINGS OR THE BORROWER, AND AGREES NOT TO PLEAD OR CLAIM, IN ANY LEGAL ACTION PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENT BROUGHT IN ANY OF THE AFOREMENTIONED COURTS, THAT SUCH COURTS LACK PERSONAL JURISDICTION OVER HOLDINGS OR THE BORROWER.  EACH OF HOLDINGS AND THE BORROWER FURTHER IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO THE SERVICE OF PROCESS OUT OF ANY OF THE AFOREMENTIONED COURTS IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING BY THE MAILING OF COPIES THEREOF BY REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED MAIL, POSTAGE PREPAID, TO HOLDINGS OR THE BORROWER AT ITS ADDRESS SET FORTH IN SECTION 11.03 AND, IN THE CASE OF SERVICE OF PROCESS TO THE BORROWER, AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 11.18, IN EACH CASE SUCH SERVICE TO BECOME EFFECTIVE 30 DAYS AFTER SUCH MAILING.  EACH OF HOLDINGS AND THE BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION TO SUCH SERVICE OF PROCESS AND FURTHER IRREVOCABLY WAIVES AND AGREES NOT TO PLEAD OR CLAIM IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING COMMENCED HEREUNDER OR UNDER ANY OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENT THAT SERVICE OF PROCESS WAS IN ANY WAY INVALID OR INEFFECTIVE.  NOTHING HEREIN SHALL AFFECT THE RIGHT OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, ANY 
		
		  
		LENDER OR THE HOLDER OF ANY NOTE TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW OR TO COMMENCE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OR OTHERWISE PROCEED AGAINST HOLDINGS OR THE BORROWER IN ANY OTHER JURISDICTION.
		
		
			(b)EACH OF HOLDINGS AND THE BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES (TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW) ANY OBJECTION WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY OF THE AFORESAID ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENT BROUGHT IN THE COURTS REFERRED TO IN CLAUSE (a) ABOVE AND HEREBY FURTHER IRREVOCABLY WAIVES AND AGREES NOT TO PLEAD OR CLAIM IN ANY SUCH COURT THAT ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.

			11.09.Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by the different parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original, but all of which shall together constitute one and the same instrument.  A set of counterparts executed by all the parties hereto shall be lodged with the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.  Delivery of an executed counterpart hereof by facsimile or electronic transmission shall be as effective as delivery of any original executed counterpart hereof.
		
		
			11.10.Effectiveness.  This Agreement shall become effective on the date (the “Effective Date”) on which (a) Holdings, the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders shall have signed a copy of this Agreement (whether the same or different copies) and shall have delivered the same to the Administrative Agent at the Notice Office or, in the case of the Lenders, shall have given to the Administrative Agent telephonic (confirmed in writing), written telex or facsimile transmission notice (actually received) that the same has been signed and mailed to it and (b) the conditions contained in Section 5.01 have been met to the reasonable satisfaction of the Administrative Agent (or duly waived by the Required Lenders). Unless the Administrative Agent has received actual notice from any Lender that the conditions described in clause (b) of the preceding sentence have not been met to its satisfaction, upon the satisfaction of the condition described in clause (a) of the immediately preceding sentence and upon the Administrative Agent’s good faith determination that the conditions in clause (b) of the immediately preceding sentence have been met, then the Effective Date shall be deemed to have occurred, regardless of any subsequent determination that one or more of the conditions thereto had not been met (although the occurrence of the Effective Date shall not release the Borrower from any liability for failure to satisfy one or more of the applicable conditions contained in Section 5.01, other than any condition that must be satisfied to the Administrative Agent’s 
		
		  
		satisfaction or other subjective standard of similar effect).  The Administrative Agent will give the Borrower and each Lender prompt written notice of the occurrence of the Effective Date.
		
		
			11.11.Headings Descriptive.  The headings of the several sections and subsections of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not in any way affect the meaning or construction of any provision of this Agreement.

		(b)If, in connection with any proposed change, waiver, discharge or termination of or to any of the provisions of this Agreement as contemplated by clauses (i) through (vi), inclusive, of the first proviso to Section 11.12(a), the consent of the Required Lenders is obtained but the consent of one or more of such other Lenders whose consent is required is not obtained, then the Borrower shall have the right, so long as all non-consenting Lenders whose individual consent is required are treated as described below, to replace each such non-consenting Lender or Lenders with one or more Replacement Lenders pursuant to Section 2.09 so long as at the time of such replacement, each such Replacement Lender consents to the proposed change, waiver, discharge or termination, provided further, that the Borrower shall not have the right to replace a Lender or repay its Loans solely as a result of the exercise of such Lender’s rights (and the withholding of any required consent by such Lender) pursuant to the second proviso to Section 11.12(a).
		
		
			(c)Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that a Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then such Lender will not be entitled to vote in respect of amendments, waivers and consents hereunder and the Commitment and the outstanding Loans of such Lender will not be taken into account in determining whether the Required Lenders, the Supermajority Lenders or all of the Lenders, as required, have approved any such amendment, waiver or consent (and the definition of “Required Lenders” and “Supermajority Lenders” will automatically be deemed modified accordingly for the duration of such period); provided that any such amendment or waiver that would increase or extend the term of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender, extend the date fixed for the payment of principal or interest owing to such Defaulting Lender hereunder, reduce the principal amount of any obligation owing to such Defaulting Lender, reduce the amount of or the rate or amount of interest on any amount owing to such Defaulting Lender or of any Fee payable to such Defaulting Lender hereunder, or alter the terms of this proviso, will require the consent of such Defaulting Lender.
		
		
			(d)Further, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 11.12, if following the Effective Date, the Administrative Agent and any Credit Party shall have jointly identified an obvious error or any error or omission of a technical or immaterial nature, in each case, in any provision of the Credit Documents, then the Administrative Agent and the Credit Parties shall be permitted to amend such provision and such amendment shall become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to any Credit Documents if the same is not objected to in writing by the Required Lenders within five Business Days following receipt of notice thereof.
		
		
			11.13.Survival.  All indemnities set forth herein including, without limitation, in Sections 2.10, 4.04, 10.06 and 11.01 shall survive the execution, delivery and termination of this Agreement and the Notes and the making and repayment of the Obligations.

			(c)Holdings waives any defense (i) based on any lack of authority of the officers, directors, partners, or agents purporting to act on behalf of any of its Subsidiaries or any principal of any of its Subsidiaries or any defect in the formation of any of its Subsidiaries or any principal thereof, (ii) based on the application by the Borrower of the proceeds of the Loans for purposes other than the purposes represented by the Borrower to the Lenders, (iii) based on any statute or rule of law that provides that the obligation of a surety must be neither larger in amount nor in any other respects more burdensome than that of a principal, (iv) based on a Lender’s election, in any proceeding instituted under the Bankruptcy Code, of the application of Section 1111 subdivision (b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code or any successor statute and (v) any borrowing or any grant of security interest under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code.
		
		
			12.09.Payments.  All payments made by Holdings pursuant to this Section 12 shall be made in Dollars and will be made without setoff, counterclaim or other defense, and shall be subject to the provisions of Sections 4.02 and 4.04.
		
		
			12.10.Maximum Liability.  It is the desire and intent of Holdings and the Guaranteed Creditors that this Holdings Guaranty shall be enforced against Holdings to the fullest extent permissible under the laws and public policies applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought.  If, however, and to the extent that, the obligations of Holdings under this Holdings Guaranty shall be adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason (including, without limitation, because of any applicable state or federal law relating to fraudulent conveyances or transfers), then the amount of Holdings’ obligations under this Holdings Guaranty shall be deemed to be reduced and Holdings shall pay the maxi¬mum amount of the Guaranteed Obligations which would be permissible under applicable law.
