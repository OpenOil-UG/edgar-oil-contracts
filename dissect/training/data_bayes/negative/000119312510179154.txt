 Exhibit 10.1 
PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT 
DERBY PROSPECT 
FRIO COUNTY, TEXAS 
This Agreement (Agreement) is made and entered into effective as of May 24, 2010 (Effective Date), by and
between Turnham Interests, Inc. (Turnham), and Goodrich Petroleum Company, L.L.C. (Goodrich), regarding the geographical area within which Goodrich will explore, develop and operate for the production of oil and gas. Both
Turnham and Goodrich shall sometimes be referred to in this Agreement, singularly as Party or collectively as Parties, as applicable. 
In consideration of the premises and the terms, covenants, conditions and benefits of the Parties, and other valuable consideration paid
each to the other, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Turnham and Goodrich agree as follows:  I.
 PROSPECT PROPERTIES   


1.1
Prospect Leases. Turnham represents, with special warranty of title that it owns the leasehold rights to those certain oil and gas leases (the Prospect
Leases, whether one or more) described in Exhibit A attached hereto, insofar and only insofar as same relate to and covers the rights and interests below the base of the Austin Chalk formation (the Deep Rights) in and
to lands highlighted in blue within the Derby Prospect (Prospect) in Frio County, Texas, which Prospect Area is shown on the plat attached hereto as Exhibit A-1 covering approximately 812.83 net mineral acres of
land, more or less.   


1.2
Review of Leases and Data. Turnham shall provide Goodrich reasonable access to all its contract, land, lease, and related records and files for examination of
the Prospect Leases. Goodrich shall have a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending fourteen (14) days following the Effective Date, to complete its review of the Prospect Leases. Goodrich may make such further examination of title to
the Prospect Leases as Goodrich deems necessary or desirable as a matter of Goodrichs sole discretion. Within the review period, Goodrich shall notify Turnham whether or not Goodrich has determined title to be good and marketable and otherwise
acceptable, and in the event title is not determined to be acceptable to Goodrich, Turnham shall have the option (but not the obligation) to satisfy any such title objections prior to closing on the oil and gas lease in question. The Parties shall
use reasonable efforts to resolve all of the title objections of Goodrich, such that Turnham can deliver good and marketable title. In the event the title objections are not satisfied in Goodrichs sole opinion, Goodrich has the option to
terminate this Agreement as to all or any one of the Prospect Leases. 




 II. 
ACQUISITION COSTS   


2.1
Acquisition Costs. At closing, Goodrich shall pay to Turnham in cash the sum of One Thousand Two Hundred Fifty and No/100 Dollars ($1,250.00.00) per net mineral
acre for a 95% interest in the Prospect Leases (the Acquisition Costs), subject to burdens out of production of 25% of 8/8, proportionately reduced, in the respective Prospect Leases. The closing of the acquisition shall occur within
fourteen (14) days of the Effective Date herein. The payment of the Acquisition Costs shall be by wire transfer of immediately available funds into an account designated by Turnham according to Turnhams wiring instructions as set forth on
Exhibit D attached hereto.  III. 
OWNERSHIP INTERESTS; COST ALLOCATION   


3.1
Ownership Interests. Except as otherwise provided by other provisions of this Agreement or the Operating Agreement, the Parties shall own the undivided leasehold

 IV. 
TEST WELL; SUBSEQUENT OPERATIONS   


4.1
Initial Test Well. Goodrich and Turnham hereby agree to participate in the drilling of an initial test well (Initial Test Well) at a location to be
selected by Goodrich within the lands covered by the Prospect Leases, or lands pooled therewith, upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. If the Prospect Leases are pooled with adjacent acreage for the Initial Test Well, the
Prospect Leases shall comprise at least 50% of the pooled unit. The Initial Test Well shall be drilled to a depth sufficient to adequately test the Eagleford formation, defined as being the logged interval between 7,934 feet and 8,050 feet as seen
on the dual induction neutron density log dated March 7, 1982, for the Energy Resources Group M.D. Burns #8 well located in the A.G. Moore Survey, Abstract 577, LaSalle County, Texas (the Objective Depth), and thereafter complete
such well as a well capable of producing oil and/or gas in paying quantities or plug and abandon same as a dry hole.   


4.2
Costs of Initial Test Well. Goodrich shall pay 100% of all costs, risks and expenses of drilling, testing and completing the Initial Test Well through the meter
at the sales point, including, without limitation, the costs of plugging and abandonment if a dry hole, and thereby carry Turnham for its 5% working interest (the Initial Carry Amount). If the Initial Test Well is drilled on a pooled
unit and therefore the Initial Carry Amount is not fully paid, the remainder of the Initial Carry Amount shall be spent on the next subsequent well drilled on the Prospect Leases, or lands pooled therewith. All operations subsequent to the
completion of the Initial Test Well (subject to satisfaction of the Initial Carry Amount on subsequent well(s)), and thereafter, all subsequent wells or operations shall be conducted and borne by the Parties in proportion to their respective
leasehold interests as set out in Exhibit A to the Operating Agreement, which is the same as their Ownership Interest in Section 3.1 of this Agreement. 
 


4.3
Drilling Access. Turnham or its designated employees, agents or consultants, shall have full and free access, at its sole risk, cost and liability, to the
derrick floor and a right to receive daily drilling reports on the progress of any test well drilled on the Prospect Leases, or lands pooled therewith, as well as copies of all logs and well completion reports, all test data and information, and
such other well data as may be reasonably requested in writing by Turnham with respect to such well, including without limitation any other information to which Goodrich is entitled under the terms of the Operating Agreement, but expressly subject
to the provisions of Art. VI. D. of the Operating Agreement.   


4.4
Substitute Well. In the event mechanical problems or impenetrable strata or other conditions, are encountered in the drilling of the Initial Test Well which
would render further drilling impracticable, and such well has not reached the Objective Depth or such conditions as would make the completion of the Initial Test Well impractical, the Parties shall advise Operator within twenty (20) days after
receipt of Operators notice (or twenty-four (24) hours if the rig is on location) to plug and abandon the Initial Test Well and proceed with the Substitute Well. Such Substitute Well shall thereafter be drilled and completed under the
same terms, provisions, and manner as provided herein for the Initial Test Well or other well for which it is a substitute and will then become the Initial Test Well for the purposes of this Agreement.

 V. 
OPERATING AGREEMENT   


5.1
Area of Mutual Interest. The Parties hereby create an Area of Mutual Interest (AMI) comprising all of the lands lying within the geographical area
defined as the Contract Area of the Operating Agreement and defined herein as the Prospect Area, which AMI shall remain in force and effect according to the terms and provisions of Art. XVI.K. of the Operating Agreement. 
 


5.2
Operating Agreement. The Parties shall execute contemporaneously herewith an Operating Agreement, identical to the one which is attached hereto as Exhibit
C (Operating Agreement), which shall be effective for all purposes as of the closing date of this Agreement, to acknowledge their acceptance and agreement to its terms and provisions. This Agreement, the Prior Agreement and
the Operating Agreement, and all of the terms and provisions thereof respectively, shall be construed together as one instrument and all such instruments considered together shall govern and control all operations, activities and production as a
result thereof within the AMI and all rights, liabilities, duties and obligations of the Parties each to the other. In the event of any conflict between this Agreement, the Prior Agreement and the Operating Agreement, this Agreement shall prevail to
the extent of any such conflict.   


5.3
Designated Operator. The Parties hereby designate Goodrich Petroleum Company L.L.C., as the Operator, under the terms of the Operating Agreement and
as used in this Agreement for all purposes.   


5.4
Insurance. Unless a Party notifies Operator in writing prior to the commencement of operations for the drilling of any test well that such Party elects to insure
itself, and provides Operator with a certificate of insurance evidencing such self insurance, Operator shall maintain the insurance coverage required by Art. VII. G. of the Operating Agreement at all times during the term of this Agreement. Should
Operator obtain insurance coverage in addition to the insurance coverage provided for in the Operating Agreement, including without limitation Operators Extra Expense (Well Control) insurance, Operator shall notify the Parties in
writing of the amount of additional coverage and their cost for same, and such Parties shall then notify Operator in writing whether not they elect to be covered by such additional insurance. If Operator does not receive a written response from any
Party within ten (10) days after receipt of notice, such Party will be deemed to have elected to be covered by such additional insurance and the costs of such additional insurance will be paid by the Party after receipt of an invoice from
Operator. If a Party elects not to be covered by such additional insurance, the Party will provide Operator, prior to the commencement of any operations, with a certificate of insurance evidencing such insurance, and in the case of Well Control
insurance the amount of such insurance shall not be less than $5,000,000.00 per occurrence.
