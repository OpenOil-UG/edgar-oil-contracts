    AMENDMENT
NUMBER 2
    TO
THE
    OCCIDENTAL
PETROLEUM CORPORATION
    SUPPLEMENTAL
RETIREMENT PLAN II
    Effective
as of January 1, 2005
    Amended
and Restated as of November 1, 2008
     
     
    The
Occidental Petroleum Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan II (Effective as
of January 1, 2005  Amended and Restated as of November 1, 2008)
(“Plan”) is hereby amended effective as of January 1, 2010 as
follows:
     
    
      

             
      
            
              1.
            
            
              Section
      2.1(d), relating to the definition of “Annual Bonus Paid,” is amended in
      its entirety to read as follows:
            
          
             
      
             
      
             
      
             
      
          
             
      
             
      
            
              (d)
            
            
              “Annual
      Bonus Paid” means up to the first $100,000 of bonus paid to a
      Participant, who is not a “named executive officer”, as that term is
      defined in Regulations S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (17
      CFR §229.402(a)(3)), during the Plan Year under a regular annual incentive
      compensation plan, such as the Company's Variable Compensation Program or
      Incentive Compensation Program (but excluding without limitation a special
      individual or group bonus, a project bonus, and any other special
      bonus).  For avoidance of doubt, “Annual Bonus Paid” means no
      more than $100,000 of bonus paid to a Participant, who is not a “named
      executive officer”, as that term is defined in Regulations S-K under the
      Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (17 CFR §229.402(a)(3)), during the Plan
      Year under any one or more regular annual incentive compensation
      plan.
            
          
             
      
             
      
             
      
             
      
          
             
      
            
              2.

      4.3(a)(1), relating to the “Eligibility” for “Allocations Relating to the
      Deferred Compensation” and the “Retirement Plan”  is amended in
      its entirety to read as follows:
