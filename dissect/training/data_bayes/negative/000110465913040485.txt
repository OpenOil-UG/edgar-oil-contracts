WITNESSETH:
 
WHEREAS, the Borrower, the Guarantors, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders have entered into that certain Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of November 4, 2010 (as amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the Credit Agreement); and
 
WHEREAS, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the Borrower and the Guarantors have agreed to amend the Credit Agreement as provided herein subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein.
 
NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged and confessed, the Borrower, the Guarantors, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereby agree as follows:
 
SECTION 1.                                       Amendments to Credit Agreement.  Subject to the satisfaction or waiver in writing of each condition precedent set forth in Section 4 of this Amendment, and in reliance on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Amendment, the Credit Agreement shall be amended in the manner provided in this Section 1.
 
1.1                                             Amended Definitions.  The following definitions in Section 1.01 of the Credit Agreement shall be and they hereby are amended and restated in their respective entireties to read as follows:
 
Aggregate Commitment means, at any time, the sum of the Commitments of all the Lenders at such time, as such amount may be reduced or increased from time to time pursuant to Section 2.02 and Section 2.03; provided that such amount shall not at any time exceed the lesser of (a) the Borrowing Base then in effect and (b) the Maximum Facility Amount.  As of the Sixth Amendment Effective Date, the Aggregate Commitment is $1,200,000,000.

Obligations means (a) any and all obligations of every nature, contingent or otherwise, whether now existing or hereafter arising, of any Credit Party from time to time owed to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, the Lenders or any of them under any Loan Document, whether for principal, interest, reimbursement of amounts drawn under any Letter of Credit, funding indemnification amounts, fees, expenses, indemnification or otherwise, (b) Lender Hedging Obligations and (c) Cash Management Obligations; provided; however, that Obligations of a Credit Party shall not include any Excluded Swap Obligations of such Credit Party.
 
1.2                                             Additional Definitions.  The following definitions shall be and they hereby are added to Section 1.01 of the Credit Agreement in appropriate alphabetical order:
 
Commodity Exchange Act means the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.), as amended from time to time, and any successor statute.
 
Eligible Contract Participant means an eligible contract participant as defined in the Commodity Exchange Act and the regulations thereunder.

Qualified ECP Guarantor means, in respect of any Swap Obligation, each Credit Party that has total assets exceeding $10,000,000 at the time the relevant Guarantee or grant of the relevant security interest becomes effective with respect to such Swap Obligation or such other person as constitutes an Eligible Contract Participant and can cause another person to qualify as an Eligible Contract Participant at such time by entering into a keepwell under Section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the Commodity Exchange Act.
 
Sixth Amendment Effective Date means May 9, 2013.
 
Swap Obligation means, with respect to any Guarantor, any obligation to pay or perform under any agreement, contract or transaction that constitutes a swap within the meaning of section 1a(47) of the Commodity Exchange Act.

(b)                                 If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest, fees and other Obligations then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties; provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, in the event such funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent as a result of the exercise of any rights and remedies with respect to any collateral under the Security Documents or as a result of any distribution made pursuant to a bankruptcy proceeding of any Credit Party or any plan of reorganization confirmed in any such proceeding, such funds shall be applied (A) first to any fees and reimbursements due Administrative Agent hereunder or under any other Loan Document, (B) then ratably to the payment of the Obligations (other than Cash Management Obligations), including unreimbursed LC Disbursements (in the manner set forth above) and the Lender Hedging Obligations until such Obligations are paid in full, and (C) then to the payment of Cash Management Obligations.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, amounts received from any Credit Party that is not an Eligible Contract Participant shall not be applied to any Excluded Swap Obligations owing to a Lender Counterparty (it being understood, that in the event that any amount is applied to Obligations other than Excluded Swap Obligations as a result of this clause, the Administrative Agent shall make such adjustments as it determines are appropriate to distributions pursuant to the foregoing clause (B) from amounts received from Eligible Contract Participants to ensure, as nearly as possible, that the proportional aggregate recoveries with respect to Obligations described in the foregoing clause (B) above by Lender Counterparties that are the holders of any Excluded Swap Obligations are the same as the proportional aggregate recoveries with respect to other Obligations pursuant to the foregoing clause (B) above).  The Administrative Agent shall have no responsibility to determine the existence or amount of Lender Hedging Obligations or Cash Management Obligations and may reserve from the application of amounts under this Section amounts distributable in respect of Lender Hedging Obligations or Cash Management Obligations until it has received evidence satisfactory to it of the existence and amount of such Lender Hedging Obligations or Cash Management Obligations.

1.4                               Current Ratio.  Effective as of March 1, 2013, Section 7.11 of the Credit Agreement shall be and it hereby is amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:
 
Section 7.11  Current Ratio.  At the end of (a) the fiscal quarter ending on March 31, 2013, the Consolidated Current Ratio will not be less than .75 to 1.0 and (b) each fiscal quarter ending thereafter, the Consolidated Current Ratio will not be less than 1.0 to 1.0.
 
1.5                               Guarantee of Obligations.  Article VIII of the Credit Agreement shall be and it hereby is amended by adding a new Section 8.10 to the end thereof to read as follows:

(a)                                 Each Qualified ECP Guarantor hereby jointly and severally absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to provide such funds or other support as may be needed from time to time by each other Credit Party to honor all of its obligations under this Agreement in respect of Swap Obligations (provided, however, that each Qualified ECP Guarantor shall only be liable under this Section 8.10 for the maximum amount of such liability that can be hereby incurred without rendering its obligations under this Section 8.10, or otherwise under this Agreement, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not for any greater amount). The obligations of each Qualified ECP Guarantor under this Section 8.10 shall remain in full force and effect until this Agreement is terminated, all Obligations are paid in full (other than contingent obligations for which no claim has been made) and all of the Lenders Commitments are terminated.  Each Qualified ECP Guarantor intends that this Section 8.10 constitute, and this Section 8.10 shall be deemed to constitute, a keepwell, support, or other agreement for the benefit of each other Credit Party for all purposes of Section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the Commodity Exchange Act.
 
(b)                                 Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, Obligations guaranteed by any Guarantor, or secured by the grant of any Lien by such Guarantor under any Security Document, shall exclude all Excluded Swap Obligations of such Guarantor.
 
1.6                               The Administrative Agent.  Article X to the Credit Agreement shall be and it hereby is amended by adding a new sentence to the end of the last paragraph thereof to read as follows:
 
Each Lender and the Issuing Bank hereby authorize the Administrative Agent to subordinate Liens on any property or assets granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document to the holder of any Lien on such property or assets that constitutes a Permitted Lien of the type described in clause (h) of the definition thereof.
