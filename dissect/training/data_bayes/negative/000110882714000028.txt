When available, actual figures will be used for the adjustments to the Purchase Price at Closing. To the extent actual figures are not available, estimates will be used subject to final adjustments in accordance with Section 3.6 and Section 3.7.5Exhibit 10.13.5    Preliminary Settlement Statement. Not less than five Business Days prior to Closing, Sellers shall prepare and submit to Buyer for review a draft settlement statement (the “Preliminary Settlement Statement”) that shall set forth the Adjusted Purchase Price, reflecting each adjustment made in accordance with this Agreement as of the date of preparation of such Preliminary Settlement Statement and the calculation of the adjustments used to determine such amount, together with the designation of Sellers’ account for the wire transfer of funds as required by Section 3.1 and Section 9.3(d). Within two Business Days after receipt of the Preliminary Settlement Statement, Buyer shall deliver to Sellers a written report containing all changes that Buyer proposes to be made to the Preliminary Settlement Statement together with the explanation therefor and the supporting documents thereof. The Parties shall in good faith attempt to agree on the Preliminary Settlement Statement as soon as possible after Sellers’ receipt of Buyer’s written report. The Preliminary Settlement Statement, as agreed upon by the Parties, will be used to adjust the Purchase Price at Closing; provided that if the Parties do not agree upon an adjustment set forth in the Preliminary Settlement Statement, then the amount of such adjustment used to adjust the Purchase Price at Closing shall be that amount set forth in the draft Preliminary Settlement Statement delivered by Sellers to Buyer pursuant to this Section 3.5.3.6    Final Settlement Statement. (a)    On or before 120 days after Closing, a final settlement statement (the “Final Settlement Statement”) will be prepared by Sellers, based on actual income and expenses during the Interim Period and which takes into account all final adjustments made to the Purchase Price and shows the resulting final Purchase Price (the “Final Price”). The Final Settlement Statement shall set forth the actual proration of the amounts required by this Agreement. As soon as practicable, and in any event within 30 days, after receipt of the Final Settlement Statement, Buyer shall return to Sellers a written report containing any proposed changes to the Final Settlement Statement and an explanation of any such changes and the reasons therefor (the “Dispute Notice”). Any changes not so specified in the Dispute Notice shall be deemed waived, and Sellers’ determinations with respect to all such elements of the Final Settlement Statement that are not addressed specifically in the Dispute Notice shall prevail. If Buyer fails to timely deliver a Dispute Notice to Sellers containing changes Buyer proposes to be made to the Final Settlement Statement, the Final Settlement Statement as delivered by Sellers will be deemed to be correct and will be final and binding on the Parties and not subject to further audit or arbitration. Subject to Section 3.6(b), if the Final Price set forth in the Final Settlement Statement is mutually agreed upon by Sellers and Buyer, the Final Settlement Statement and the Final Price, shall be final and binding on the Parties. Any difference in the Adjusted Purchase Price as paid at Closing pursuant to the Preliminary Settlement Statement and the Final Price shall be paid by the owing Party within ten days of final determination of such owed amounts in accordance herewith to the owed Party. All amounts paid pursuant to this Section 3.6 shall be delivered in United States currency by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified in writing by the relevant Party. (b)    If after the delivery of the Final Settlement Statement pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.6(a) (i) either Party receives monies (including proceeds of production) belonging to the other Party pursuant to Section 2.3 or otherwise, then such monies shall, within five Business Days after the end of the month in which they were received, be paid over by the receiving Party to the owed Party, (ii) either Party pays monies for Operating Expenses that are the obligation of the other Party pursuant to Section 2.3 or otherwise, then the obligated Party shall, within five Business Days after the end of the month in which the applicable invoice and proof of payment of such invoice are received by it, reimburse the paying Party therefor, (iii) either Party receives an invoice of an expense or obligation that is owed by the other Party pursuant to Section 2.3 or otherwise, then the receiving Party shall promptly forward such invoice to the obligated Party and (iv) if an invoice of an expense or other obligation is received by either Party and is the obligation of both Parties, then the Parties shall consult with each other and shall each promptly pay its portion of such invoice to the obligee. Each Party shall be permitted to offset any monies owed by it to the 6Exhibit 10.1other Party pursuant to this Section 3.6 against amounts owing by it to such other Party pursuant to this Section 3.6.3.7    Disputes. If Sellers and Buyer are unable to resolve the matters addressed in the Dispute Notice, each of Buyer and Sellers shall within ten Business Days after the delivery of such Dispute Notice, summarize its position with regard to such dispute in a written document of 20 pages or less and submit such summaries to such Person as the Parties may mutually select (the “Accounting Arbitrator”), together with the Dispute Notice, the Final Settlement Statement and any other documentation such Party may desire to submit. Within ten Business Days after receiving the Parties’ respective submissions, the Accounting Arbitrator shall render a decision choosing either Sellers’ position or Buyer’s position with respect to each matter addressed in any Dispute Notice, based on the materials described above. Any decision rendered by the Accounting Arbitrator pursuant hereto shall be final, conclusive and binding on Sellers and Buyer and enforceable against any of the Parties in any court of competent jurisdiction. The costs of such Accounting Arbitrators shall be borne one-half by Buyer and one-half by Sellers. 3.8    Allocation of Purchase Price; Allocated Values. Solely for the purposes of Article XI and Article XII, Buyer and Sellers agree that the Purchase Price shall be allocated among the Assets as set forth on Schedule 3.8 (the “Allocated Values”). 3.9    Allocation for Imbalances at Closing. If, prior to Closing, any Party discovers an error in the Imbalances set forth on Schedule 4.12, then the Purchase Price shall be further adjusted at Closing pursuant to Section 3.3(a)(v), Section 3.3(a)(vi), Section 3.3(b)(vi) or Section 3.3(b)(vii), as applicable, and Schedule 4.12 will be deemed amended immediately prior to Closing to reflect the Imbalances for which the Purchase Price is so adjusted. 3.10    Holdback Amount.(a)    At Closing, in partial satisfaction of Buyer’s payment obligations under Section 3.1, the Deposit, but specifically excluding any interest or income earned thereon to the Closing, shall be retained by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement and from and after the Closing the Deposit and all interest or other amounts earned thereon after the Closing shall be the “Holdback Amount” for the purposes of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The Holdback Amount shall be paid out in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.10 and the Escrow Agreement by way of security against all obligations of Sellers to defend and indemnify or otherwise pay any amounts owed by Sellers to Buyer and Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to Sellers’ payment, defense and indemnity obligations under Section 13.2 and Sellers’ special warranty of title under Sections 11.1(b) and (c). (b)    To the extent that Sellers do not promptly (and in any event within 10 Business Days after receipt of written notice from Buyer) reimburse or pay Buyer for any Liabilities for which Buyer is entitled to be indemnified or paid by Sellers pursuant to Sections 11.1(b) and (c) or Section 13.2, then Buyer shall be entitled, at any time and from time to time, to deliver to the Escrow Agent and Sellers one or more written notices (an “Escrow Claim Notice”) which notice shall specify with particularity the nature and Buyer’s good faith estimate of the amount of the claim (the “Escrow Claim”), including the provision of this Agreement entitling Buyer to such Escrow Claim. Upon Sellers’ and Buyer’s agreement on the amount and validity of such Escrow Claim, Sellers and Buyer shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to disburse to Buyer the amount set forth in such joint instructions, which will be that portion of the Holdback Amount being held in the Escrow Account as would satisfy such Escrow Claim. If Sellers and Buyer are unable to agree on the amount or validity of any such Escrow Claim, it shall be resolved in accordance with Section 15.13 (except that with respect to Sellers’ indemnity obligations for Specified Obligations, in accordance with Section 13.13) and if upon the resolution or determination of any such Escrow Claim, the Parties fail to deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent in accordance with the foregoing sentence, then the Escrow 7Exhibit 10.1Agent shall pay the Escrow Claim to Buyer upon delivery by any Party to the Escrow Agent of a final and non-appealable written court order resolving such dispute and directing the payment of a specified amount to Buyer with respect to such Escrow Claim (except that with respect to Sellers’ indemnity obligations for Specified Obligations, a final and binding arbitral award issued by arbitrators in accordance with Section 13.13). The Escrow Agent shall release to Sellers any portion of the Holdback Amount remaining in the Escrow Account on the first Business Day that is 273 days after the Closing Date, except for the aggregate amount of all outstanding Escrow Claims for which Buyer has, in good faith, provided an Escrow Claim Notice to Sellers and Escrow Agent in accordance with Section 3.10(b) that has not been previously satisfied (which monies shall remain part of the Holdback Amount until final resolution of such outstanding Escrow Claims). Upon the final resolution and payment of all Escrow Claim Notices delivered by Buyer during the Survival Period, Buyer and Sellers shall execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent written instruction to release any remaining Holdback Amount to Sellers.ARTICLE IVREPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLERSSubject to the matters specifically listed or disclosed in the Schedules (as added, supplemented or amended pursuant to Section 6.6), each Seller jointly and severally with each other Seller represents and warrants to Buyer, as of the Execution Date and as of the Closing Date, the following:4.1    Organization, Existence and Qualification.

(b)    Buyer shall be entitled to conduct a Phase I environmental property assessment with respect to the Assets to be conducted by a reputable environmental consulting or engineering firm approved in advance in writing by Sellers; provided further that any sampling or invasive activity by Buyer or Buyer’s Representatives shall require the prior written consent of Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, and Sellers shall have the right to be present during any stage of the assessment. Buyer shall give Sellers reasonable prior written notice before entering onto any of the Assets, and Sellers or their designee shall have the right to accompany Buyer and Buyer’s Representatives whenever they are on site on the Assets. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer shall not have access to, and shall not be permitted to conduct any environmental due diligence (including any Phase I environmental property assessment) with respect to, any Assets with respect to which Sellers do not have the authority to grant access for such due diligence. Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain access rights from Third Parties for Buyer to conduct its investigation and due diligence of the Assets; provided that Sellers shall not be required to incur any Liability or pay any money in order to obtain such access rights.(c)    Buyer shall coordinate its environmental property assessments and physical inspections of the Assets with Sellers and all Third Party operators to minimize any inconvenience to or interruption of the conduct of business by Sellers or such Third Party operators. Buyer shall abide by Sellers’, and any Third Party operator’s, safety rules, regulations and operating policies while conducting its due diligence evaluation of the Assets, including any environmental or other inspection or assessment of the Assets and, to the extent required by Sellers or any Third Party operator, execute and deliver any required boarding agreement of Sellers or any such Third Party operator.

Sellers shall not be deemed by their receipt of said documents or otherwise to have made any representation or warranty, expressed, implied or statutory, as to the condition of the Assets or to the accuracy of said documents or the information contained therein. (e)    Upon completion of Buyer’s due diligence, Buyer shall at its sole cost and expense and without any cost or expense to Sellers or their Affiliates (i) repair all damage done to the Assets in connection with Buyer’s due diligence, (ii) restore the Assets to the approximate same condition as, or better condition than, they were prior to commencement of Buyer’s due diligence and (iii) remove all equipment, tools or other property brought onto the Assets in connection with Buyer’s due diligence. Any disturbance to the Assets (including the leasehold associated therewith) resulting from Buyer’s due diligence will be promptly corrected by Buyer.(f)    During all periods that Buyer or any of Buyer’s Representatives are on the Assets, Buyer shall maintain, at its sole expense and with insurers reasonably satisfactory to Sellers, policies of insurance of the types and in the amounts reasonably requested by Sellers.

If Closing should occur, the foregoing confidentiality restriction on Buyer, including the Confidentiality Agreement, shall terminate (except as to (a) such portion of the Assets that are not conveyed to Buyer pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, (b) the Excluded Assets and (c) information related to assets other than the Assets). 10.3    Disclaimers.a.EXCEPT AS AND TO THE LIMITED EXTENT EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN ARTICLE IV, SECTION 11.1(b) OR THE ASSIGNMENT, (I) SELLERS MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, STATUTORY OR IMPLIED, AND (II) SELLERS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL LIABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, STATEMENT OR INFORMATION MADE OR COMMUNICATED (ORALLY OR IN WRITING) TO BUYER OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, CONSULTANTS OR REPRESENTATIVES (INCLUDING ANY OPINION, INFORMATION, PROJECTION OR ADVICE THAT MAY HAVE BEEN PROVIDED TO BUYER BY ANY OFFICER, DIRECTOR, EMPLOYEE, AGENT, CONSULTANT, REPRESENTATIVE OR ADVISOR OF SELLERS OR ANY OF THEIR AFFILIATES).b.EXCEPT AS AND TO THE LIMITED EXTENT EXPRESSLY REPRESENTED OTHERWISE IN ARTICLE IV, SECTION 11.1(b) OR THE ASSIGNMENT, AND WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, SELLERS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS, STATUTORY OR IMPLIED, AS TO (I) TITLE 20Exhibit 10.1TO ANY OF THE ASSETS, (II) THE CONTENTS, CHARACTER OR NATURE OF ANY REPORT OF ANY PETROLEUM ENGINEERING CONSULTANT, OR ANY ENGINEERING, GEOLOGICAL OR SEISMIC DATA OR INTERPRETATION RELATING TO THE ASSETS, (III) THE QUANTITY, QUALITY OR RECOVERABILITY OF HYDROCARBONS IN OR FROM THE ASSETS, (IV) ANY ESTIMATES OF THE VALUE OF THE ASSETS OR FUTURE REVENUES TO BE GENERATED BY THE ASSETS, (V) THE PRODUCTION OF OR ABILITY TO PRODUCE HYDROCARBONS FROM THE ASSETS, (VI) THE MAINTENANCE, REPAIR, CONDITION, QUALITY, SUITABILITY, DESIGN OR MARKETABILITY OF THE ASSETS, (VII) THE CONTENT, CHARACTER OR NATURE OF ANY INFORMATION MEMORANDUM, REPORTS, BROCHURES, CHARTS OR STATEMENTS PREPARED BY SELLERS OR THIRD PARTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE ASSETS, (VIII) ANY OTHER MATERIALS OR INFORMATION THAT MAY HAVE BEEN MADE AVAILABLE TO BUYER OR ITS AFFILIATES, OR ITS OR THEIR RESPECTIVE EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, CONSULTANTS, REPRESENTATIVES OR ADVISORS IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY DISCUSSION OR PRESENTATION RELATING THERETO AND (IX) ANY IMPLIED OR EXPRESS WARRANTY OF FREEDOM FROM PATENT OR TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT.

Except for the special warranty of title as set forth in Section 11.1(b) and the Assignment and without limiting Buyer’s remedies for Title Defects set forth in this Article XI, Sellers make no warranty or representation, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to Sellers’ title to any of the Assets, and Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that Buyer’s sole remedy for any defect of title, including any Title Defect, with respect to any of the Assets (i) before Closing, shall be as set forth in Section 11.2(d) or if applicable, Section 14.1(c) and (ii) after Closing, shall be pursuant to the special warranty of title set forth in Section 11.1(b) and the Assignment.(b)    Special Warranty of Title. Effective as of the Closing Date and until the end of the Survival Period, each Seller warrants Defensible Title to the Leases, Wells and Well Locations (subject to any reservations, limitations or depth restrictions in the Leases or otherwise described on Exhibit A, Exhibit B or Schedule 3.8) unto Buyer against every Person whomsoever lawfully claims the same or any part thereof by, through or under such Seller, but not otherwise, subject, however, to the Permitted Encumbrances; provided, however, that, except with respect to any liability of Sellers for any claim asserted in writing by Buyer to Sellers in accordance with Section 11.1(c) on or before the expiration of the Survival Period for breach of such special warranty, such special warranty shall cease and terminate at the end of such Survival Period.(c)    Recovery on Special Warranty. (i)    Buyer’s Assertion of Title Warranty Breaches. Prior to the expiration of the period of time commencing as of the Closing Date and ending at 5:00 p.m. (Central Time) on the first Business Day that is 273 days after the Closing Date (the “Survival Period”), Buyer shall furnish Sellers a written notice (the “Special Warranty Claim Notice”) meeting the requirements of Section 11.2(a) setting forth any matters which Buyer intends to assert as a breach of Sellers’ special warranty in Section 11.1(b). For all purposes of this Agreement, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived, and Sellers shall have no further liability for, any breach of Sellers’ special warranty that Buyer fails to assert by a Special Warranty Claim Notice given to Sellers on or before the expiration of the Survival Period. Sellers shall have a reasonable opportunity, but not the obligation, to cure any Title Defect asserted by Buyer pursuant to this Section 11.1(c)(i). Buyer agrees to reasonably cooperate with any attempt by Sellers to cure any such Title Defect. (ii)    Limitations on Special Warranty. For purposes of Sellers’ special warranty of title, the value of the Wells and Well Locations set forth on Schedule 3.8, as appropriate (subject to any reservations, limitations or depth restrictions in the Leases or otherwise described on Exhibit A, Exhibit B or Schedule 3.8), shall be deemed to be the Allocated Value thereof, as adjusted herein. Recovery on Sellers’ special warranty of title shall be limited to an amount (without any interest accruing thereon) equal to the reduction in the Purchase Price to which Buyer would have been entitled had Buyer asserted the defect giving rise to such breach of Sellers’ special warranty of title as a Title Defect prior to Closing pursuant to Section 11.2 (including subject to the limitations described in Section 11.2(i)). 11.2    Notice of Title Defects; Defect Adjustments.     (a)    Title Defect Notices. Buyer must deliver no later than 5:00 p.m. (Central Time) on January 24, 2014 (the “Title Claim Date”) claim notices to Sellers meeting the requirements of this Section 11.2(a) (collectively the “Title Defect Notices” and individually a “Title Defect Notice”) setting forth any matters which, in Buyer’s reasonable opinion, constitute Title Defects and which Buyer intends to assert as a Title Defect pursuant to this Section 11.2(a). For all purposes of this Agreement and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary (except as provided in Section 11.1), Buyer shall be deemed to have waived, and Sellers shall have no liability for, any Title Defect which Buyer fails to assert as a Title Defect by a properly delivered Title Defect Notice received by Sellers on or before the Title Claim Date; provided, 22Exhibit 10.1however, that, for purposes of Sellers’ special warranty to title under Section 11.1(b), such waiver shall not apply to any matter that prior to the Title Claim Date is not discovered by any of Buyer’s or any of its Affiliate’s employees, title attorneys, landmen or other title examiners while conducting Buyer’s due diligence with respect to the Assets and may be claimed by Buyer pursuant to Section 11.1. To be effective, each Title Defect Notice shall be in writing and shall include (i) a description of the alleged Title Defect and the Asset (including the legal description of such Asset and the Leases applicable to such Asset), or portion thereof, affected by such Title Defect (each a “Title Defect Property”), (ii) the Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property, (iii) supporting documents reasonably necessary for Sellers to verify the existence of such alleged Title Defect, (iv) Buyer’s preferred manner of curing each Title Defect and (v) the amount by which Buyer reasonably believes the Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property is reduced by such alleged Title Defect and the computations upon which Buyer’s belief is based. To give Sellers an opportunity to commence reviewing and curing Title Defects, Buyer agrees to use reasonable efforts to give Sellers, on or before the end of each calendar week prior to the Title Claim Date, written notice of all alleged Title Defects (as well as any claims that would be claims under the special warranty set forth in Section 11.1) discovered by Buyer during the preceding calendar week, which notice may be preliminary in nature and supplemented prior to the Title Claim Date. Buyer shall also, promptly upon discovery, furnish Sellers with written notice of any Title Benefit which is discovered by any of Buyer’s or any of its Affiliate’s employees, title attorneys, landmen or other title examiners while conducting Buyer’s due diligence with respect to the Assets prior to the Title Claim Date. (b)    Title Benefit Notices. Sellers shall have the right, but not the obligation, to deliver to Buyer on or before the Title Claim Date with respect to each Title Benefit a notice (a “Title Benefit Notice”) including (i) a description of the alleged Title Benefit and the Asset, or portion thereof, affected by such alleged Title Benefit (each a “Title Benefit Property”), and (ii) the amount by which Sellers reasonably believe the Allocated Value of such Title Benefit Property is increased by such alleged Title Benefit and the computations upon which Sellers’ belief is based. Except as set forth in Section 11.1(c)(ii) and Section 11.2(a), Sellers shall be deemed to have waived all Title Benefits for which a Title Benefit Notice has not been delivered on or before the Title Claim Date.    (c)    Sellers’ Right to Cure. Each Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at its sole cost, to cure at any time prior to 120 days after Closing (the “Cure Period”), any Title Defects of which it has been advised by Buyer. During the period of time from Closing to the expiration of the Cure Period, Buyer agrees to afford such Seller and its officers, employees and other authorized representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours, to the Assets and all Records in Buyer’s or any of its Affiliates’ possession in order to facilitate such Seller’s attempt to cure any such Title Defects. The Title Defect Amount claimed in good faith by Buyer for any Title Defect as to which such Seller has provided notice to Buyer that such Seller intends to attempt to cure the Title Defect during the Cure Period, shall be paid by Buyer at Closing to the Escrow Agent pursuant to an escrow agreement mutually acceptable to the Parties and any such amount shall be paid to Sellers or Buyer, as applicable, upon the expiration of the Cure Period and as agreed by the Sellers and Buyer or determined pursuant to Section 11.2(j). An election by such Seller to attempt to cure a Title Defect shall be without prejudice to its rights under Section 11.2(j) and shall not constitute an admission against interest or a waiver of such Seller’s right to dispute the existence, nature or value of, or cost to cure, the alleged Title Defect. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, with respect to any Asset that is owned by more than one Seller, Sellers shall make their elections described in Sections 11.2(c), 11.2(d), 12.1(a) or 12.1(b) as a group through the Seller Representative. (d)    Remedies for Title Defects. Subject to each Seller’s continuing right to dispute the existence of a Title Defect and the Title Defect Amount asserted with respect thereto, and subject to the rights of the Parties pursuant to Section 14.1(c), in the event that any Title Defect timely and effectively asserted 23Exhibit 10.1by Buyer in accordance with Section 11.2(a) is not waived in writing by Buyer or cured during the Cure Period, Sellers shall, at their sole option, elect to: (i)    subject to the Individual Title Defect Threshold and the Aggregate Deductible, convey the Title Defect Property to Buyer at Closing, and reduce the Purchase Price or Final Price, as applicable, by the Title Defect Amount determined pursuant to Section 11.2(g) or Section 11.2(j);(ii)    with the written consent of Buyer, retain the entirety of the Title Defect Property that is subject to such Title Defect, together with all associated Assets, in which event the Purchase Price or Final Price, as applicable, shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property and such associated Assets; or(iii)    if applicable, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 14.1(c).(e)    Remedies for Title Benefits. The amount resulting from a Title Benefit (the “Title Benefit Amount”) shall be determined pursuant to Section 11.2(h) or Section 11.2(j). Any Title Benefit Amounts shall be offset against the total Title Defect Amounts for all Title Defects. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section, if the total of all Title Benefit Amounts exceeds the total of all Title Defect Amounts for the Assets, there shall be no upward adjustment to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided to Sellers for such Title Benefits.(f)    Exclusive Remedy. Except for Buyer’s rights under Sellers’ special warranty of title under Section 11.1(b) and Buyer’s rights to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 14.1(c), the provisions set forth in Section 11.2(d) shall be the exclusive right and remedy of Buyer with respect to such Seller’s failure to have Defensible Title with respect to any Asset or any other title matter.(g)    Title Defect Amount. The amount by which the Allocated Value of a Title Defect Property is reduced as a result of the existence of a Title Defect shall be the “Title Defect Amount” and shall be determined in accordance with the following terms and conditions:i.if Buyer and the affected Sellers agree on the Title Defect Amount, then that amount shall be the Title Defect Amount;ii.if the Title Defect is an Encumbrance that is undisputed and liquidated in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the amount necessary to be paid to remove the Title Defect from the Title Defect Property;iii.if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (A) Sellers’ Net Revenue Interest for any Title Defect Property and (B) the Net Revenue Interest set forth for such Title Defect Property on Schedule 3.8, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Net Revenue Interest decrease and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest set forth for such Title Defect Property on Schedule 3.8; iv.if the Title Defect represents an obligation or Encumbrance upon or other defect in title to the Title Defect Property of a type not described above, then the Title Defect Amount shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property, the portion of the Title Defect Property affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect, the potential economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of the Title Defect Property, the values placed upon the Title Defect by Buyer and the affected Seller and such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation;v.the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect Property shall be determined without duplication of any losses included in another Title Defect Amount hereunder; andvi.notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article XI, the aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title Defects upon any Title Defect Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property. 24Exhibit 10.1(h)Title Benefit Amount. The Title Benefit Amount resulting from a Title Benefit shall be determined in accordance with the following methodology, terms and conditions:(i)if Buyer and affected Sellers agree on the Title Benefit Amount, then that amount shall be the Title Benefit Amount; (ii)if the Title Benefit represents a discrepancy between (A) the affected Sellers’ Net Revenue Interest for any Title Benefit Property and (B) the Net Revenue Interest set forth for such Title Benefit Property on Schedule 3.8, then the Title Benefit Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Title Benefit Property multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Net Revenue Interest increase and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest set forth for such Title Benefit Property on Schedule 3.8; and(iii)if the Title Benefit is of a type not described above, then the Title Benefit Amounts shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of Title Benefit Property, the portion of such Title Benefit Property affected by such Title Benefit, the legal effect of the Title Benefit, the potential economic effect of the Title Benefit over the life of such Title Benefit Property, the values placed upon the Title Benefit by Buyer and affected Sellers and such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation.(i)Title Defect Threshold and Deductible. Except as provided in this Section 11.2(i), (i) there shall not be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Sellers for any individual Title Defect for which the Title Defect Amount does not exceed $25,000 (the “Individual Title Defect Threshold”); and (ii) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Sellers for any Title Defect that exceeds the Individual Title Defect Threshold unless (A) the amount of the sum of (1) the aggregate Title Defect Amounts of all such Title Defects that exceed the Individual Title Defect Threshold (but excluding any such Title Defects cured by Sellers), plus (2) the aggregate Remediation Amounts of all Environmental Defects that exceed the Individual Environmental Threshold (but excluding any Environmental Defects cured by Sellers), exceeds (B) the Aggregate Deductible, after which point Buyer shall be entitled to adjustments to the Purchase Price or other applicable remedies available hereunder, but only with respect to the amount by which the aggregate amount of such Title Defect Amounts and Remediation Amounts exceeds the Aggregate Deductible. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Individual Title Threshold and the Aggregate Deductible shall not apply to any Title Defect which arises from typographical, clerical or scrivener’s error (such as misplaced decimal points, transposed digits and similar erroneous entries of data in the ARIES database as compared to the documents in Sellers’ possession from which such information was extracted) in the Exhibits or Schedules to this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, if Sellers retain any Title Defect Property pursuant to Section 11.2(d)(ii), the Title Defect Amount related to such Title Defect Property will not be counted towards the Aggregate Deductible. (j)Title Dispute Resolution. Sellers and Buyer shall attempt to agree on matters regarding (i) all Title Defects, Title Benefits, Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts, and (ii) the adequacy of any curative materials provided by Sellers to cure an alleged Title Defect (the “Disputed Title Matters”) prior to Closing. If Sellers and Buyer are unable to agree by Closing (or by the end of the Cure Period if Sellers elect to attempt to cure a Title Defect after Closing), the Disputed Title Matters shall be exclusively and finally resolved pursuant to this Section 11.2(j). There shall be a single arbitrator, who shall be a title attorney with at least ten years’ experience in oil and gas titles involving properties in the regional area in which the Title Defect Properties are located, as selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and Sellers within 15 days after the Closing or the end of the Cure Period, as applicable, and absent such agreement, by the Houston, Texas office of the American Arbitration Association (the “Title Arbitrator”). Each of Buyer and Sellers shall submit to the Title Arbitrator its proposed resolution of the Disputed Title Matter. The proposed resolution of the Disputed Title Matter shall include the best offer of the submitting Party in a single monetary amount that such Party is willing to pay or accept (as applicable) to settle the Disputed Title Matter. The Title Arbitrator shall be limited to awarding only one or the other of the two proposed settlement amounts. The 25Exhibit 10.1arbitration proceeding shall be held in Houston, Texas and shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this Section 11.2(j). The Title Arbitrator’s determination shall be made within 20 days after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding upon the Parties, without right of appeal. In making its determination, the Title Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in Section 11.2(g) and Section 11.2(h) and, subject to the foregoing, may consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Title Arbitrator are necessary to make a proper determination. The Title Arbitrator, however, may not award Buyer a greater Title Defect Amount than the Title Defect Amount claimed by Buyer in its applicable Title Defect Notice. The Title Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific Disputed Title Matter submitted by either Party and may not award damages, interest or penalties to either Party with respect to any matter. Sellers and Buyer shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case. Sellers and Buyer shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Title Arbitrator. To the extent that the award of the Title Arbitrator with respect to any Title Defect Amount or Title Benefit Amount is not taken into account as an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 3.5 or Section 3.6, then within ten days after the Title Arbitrator delivers written notice to Buyer and Sellers of his award with respect to a Title Defect Amount or a Title Benefit Amount and, subject to Section 11.2(i), (i) Buyer shall pay to Sellers the amount, if any, so awarded by the Title Arbitrator to Sellers, and (ii) Sellers shall pay to Buyer the amount, if any, so awarded by the Title Arbitrator to Buyer. Nothing herein shall operate to cause Closing to be delayed on account of any arbitration conducted pursuant to this Section 11.2(j) and, to the extent any adjustments are not agreed upon by the Parties as of Closing, the Purchase Price shall not be adjusted therefor at Closing, such amount shall be paid by Buyer into escrow pursuant to Section 11.2(c) and subsequent adjustments to the Purchase Price, if any, will be made pursuant to the Final Settlement Statement described in Section 3.6 and this Section 11.2.11.3    Casualty Loss. a.Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, from and after the Effective Time, if Closing occurs, Buyer shall assume all risk of loss with respect to production of Hydrocarbons through normal depletion (including watering out of any well, collapsed casing or sand infiltration of any well) and the depreciation of Personal Property due to ordinary wear and tear, in each case, with respect to the Assets, and Buyer shall not assert such matters as Casualty Losses or Title Defects hereunder.b.If, after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Closing Date, any portion of the Assets is damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty or is taken in condemnation or under right of eminent domain (each, a “Casualty Loss”), and the Closing thereafter occurs and if the estimated cost to repair such Asset (with equipment of similar utility) is greater than $100,000, Buyer shall not be obligated to purchase such Asset. If Buyer declines to purchase such Asset, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such Asset. If Buyer elects to purchase such Asset, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the estimated cost to repair such Asset (with equipment of similar utility), less all insurance proceeds which Seller shall cause to be paid to Buyer, up to the Allocated Value thereof (the reduction being the “Net Casualty Loss”). Sellers, at their sole option, may elect to cure such Casualty Loss to Buyer’s reasonable satisfaction and, in such event, Sellers shall be entitled to all insurance proceeds. If Sellers elect to cure such Casualty Loss, Sellers may replace any personal property that is the subject of a Casualty Loss with equipment of similar grade and utility. If Sellers cure the Casualty Loss to Buyer’s reasonable satisfaction, Buyer shall purchase the affected Asset at Closing for the Allocated Value thereof.11.4    Consents to Assign. With respect to each Consent set forth on Schedule 4.4, Sellers, prior to Closing, shall send to the holder of each such Consent a notice in material compliance with the contractual provisions applicable to such Consent seeking such holder’s consent to the transactions contemplated hereby. 26Exhibit 10.1a.If (i) Sellers fail to obtain a Consent set forth on Schedule 4.4 prior to Closing and the failure to obtain such Consent would cause (A) the assignment of the Assets (or portion thereof) affected thereby to Buyer to be void or voidable under the terms thereof or (B) the termination of a Lease or Contract under the terms thereof, or (ii) a Consent requested by Sellers is denied in writing, then, in each case, the Asset (or portion thereof) affected by such un-obtained Consent shall be excluded from the Assets to be assigned to Buyer at Closing, and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such Asset (or portion thereof) so excluded. In the event that a Consent (with respect to an Asset excluded pursuant to this Section 11.4(a)) that was not obtained prior to Closing is obtained within 120 days following Closing, then, within ten days after such Consent is obtained (x) Buyer shall purchase the Asset (or portion thereof) that was so excluded as a result of such previously un-obtained Consent and pay to Sellers the amount by which the Purchase Price was reduced at Closing with respect to the Asset (or portion thereof) so excluded and (y) Sellers shall assign to Buyer the Asset (or portion thereof) so excluded at Closing pursuant to an instrument in substantially the same form as the Assignment. b.If (i) Sellers fail to obtain a Consent set forth on Schedule 4.4 prior to Closing and the failure to obtain such Consent would not cause (A) the assignment of the Assets (or portion thereof) affected thereby to Buyer to be void or voidable under the terms thereof or (B) the termination of a Lease or Contract under the terms thereof, and (ii) such Consent requested by Sellers is not denied in writing by the holder thereof, then the Asset (or portion thereof) subject to such un-obtained Consent shall nevertheless be assigned by Sellers to Buyer at Closing as part of the Assets and Buyer shall have no claim against, and Sellers shall have no Liability for, the failure to obtain such Consent.c.Prior to Closing, Sellers and Buyer shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all Consents listed on Schedule 4.4; provided, however, that no Party shall be required to incur any Liability or pay any money in order to obtain any such Consent. Subject to the foregoing, Buyer agrees to provide Sellers with any information or documentation that may be reasonably requested by Sellers or the Third Party holder(s) of such Consents in order to facilitate the process of obtaining such Consents.ARTICLE XIIENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS12.1    Notice of Environmental Defects. (a)    Environmental Defects Notice. Buyer must deliver no later than 5:00 p.m. (Central Time) on January 17, 2014 (the “Environmental Claim Date”) claim notices to Sellers meeting the requirements of this Section 12.1(a) (collectively the “Environmental Defect Notices” and individually an “Environmental Defect Notice”) setting forth any matters which, in Buyer’s reasonable opinion, constitute Environmental Defects and which Buyer intends to assert as Environmental Defects pursuant to this Section 12.1. For all purposes of this Agreement, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived, and Sellers shall have no liability for, any Environmental Defect which Buyer fails to assert as an Environmental Defect by a properly delivered Environmental Defect Notice received by Sellers on or before the Environmental Claim Date, with such liabilities being “Buyer’s Environmental Liabilities.” To be effective, each Environmental Defect Notice shall be in writing and shall include (i) a description of the matter constituting the alleged Environmental Condition (including the applicable Environmental Law violated or implicated thereby) and the Assets affected by such alleged Environmental Condition, (ii) the Allocated Value of the Assets (or portions thereof) affected by such alleged Environmental Condition, (iii) supporting documents reasonably necessary for Sellers to verify the existence of such alleged Environmental Condition, and (iv) a calculation of the Remediation Amount (itemized in reasonable detail) that Buyer asserts is attributable to such alleged Environmental Defect. Buyer’s calculation of the Remediation Amount included in the Environmental Defect 27Exhibit 10.1Notice must describe in reasonable detail the Remediation proposed for the alleged Environmental Condition that gives rise to the asserted Environmental Defect and identify all assumptions used by the Buyer in calculating the Remediation Amount, including the standards that Buyer asserts must be met to comply with Environmental Laws. Sellers shall have the right, but not the obligation, to cure any asserted Environmental Defect on or before the expiration of the Cure Period. To give Sellers an opportunity to commence reviewing and curing Environmental Defects, Buyer agrees to use reasonable efforts to give Sellers, on or before the end of each calendar week prior to the Environmental Claim Date, written notice of all alleged Environmental Defects discovered by Buyer during the preceding calendar week, which notice may be preliminary in nature and supplemented prior to the Environmental Claim Date.(b)    Remedies for Environmental Defects. Subject to each Seller’s continuing right to dispute the existence of an Environmental Defect or the Remediation Amount asserted with respect thereto, and subject to the rights of the Parties pursuant to Section 14.1(c), in the event that any Environmental Defect timely asserted by Buyer in accordance with Section 12.1(a) is not waived in writing by Buyer or cured during the Cure Period, such Seller shall, at its sole option, elect to:(i)subject to the Individual Environmental Threshold and the Aggregate Deductible, reduce the Purchase Price by the Remediation Amount;(ii)retain the entirety of the Asset that is subject to such Environmental Defect, together with all associated Assets, in which event the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Asset and such associated Assets; (iii)if applicable, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 14.1(c). If any Seller elects the option set forth in clause (i) above, Buyer shall be deemed to have assumed responsibility for all of the costs and expenses attributable to the Remediation of the Environmental Condition attributable to such Environmental Defect and all Liabilities with respect thereto and such responsibility of Buyer shall be deemed to constitute part of the Assumed Obligations hereunder. (c)    Exclusive Remedy. Except for Buyer’s rights to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 14.1(c), the provisions set forth in Section 12.1(b) shall be the exclusive right and remedy of Buyer with respect to any Environmental Defect with respect to any Asset or other environmental matter.(d)    Environmental Deductibles. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (i) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Sellers for any individual Environmental Defect for which the Remediation Amount does not exceed $50,000 (the “Individual Environmental Threshold”); and (ii) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Sellers for any Environmental Defect for which the Remediation Amount exceeds the Individual Environmental Threshold unless (A) the amount of the sum of (1) the aggregate Remediation Amounts of all such Environmental Defects that exceed the Individual Environmental Threshold (but excluding any Environmental Defects cured by Sellers), plus (2) the aggregate Title Defect Amounts of all Title Defects that exceed the Individual Title Defect Threshold (but excluding any Title Defects cured by Sellers), exceeds (B) the Aggregate Deductible, after which point Buyer shall be entitled to adjustments to the Purchase Price or other applicable remedies available hereunder, but only with respect to the amount by which the aggregate amount of such Remediation Amounts and Title Defect Amounts exceeds the Aggregate Deductible. For the avoidance of doubt, if Sellers retain any Assets pursuant to Section 12.1(b)(ii), the Remediation Amounts relating to such retained Assets will not be counted towards the Aggregate Deductible. 28Exhibit 10.1(e)    Environmental Dispute Resolution. Sellers and Buyer shall attempt to agree on all Environmental Defects and Remediation Amounts prior to Closing. If Sellers and Buyer are unable to agree by Closing, the Environmental Defects and Remediation Amounts in dispute shall be exclusively and finally resolved by arbitration pursuant to this Section 12.1(e). There shall be a single arbitrator, who shall be an environmental attorney with at least ten years’ experience in environmental matters involving oil and gas producing properties in the regional area in which the affected Assets are located, as selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and Sellers within 15 days after the Closing Date, and absent such agreement, by the Houston, Texas office of the American Arbitration Association (the “Environmental Arbitrator”). The arbitration proceeding shall be held in Houston, Texas and shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this Section 12.1. The Environmental Arbitrator’s determination shall be made within 20 days after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding upon the Parties, without right of appeal. In making its determination, the Environmental Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in this Section 12.1 and, subject to the foregoing, may consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Environmental Arbitrator are necessary or helpful to make a proper determination. The Environmental Arbitrator, however, may not award Buyer its share of any greater Remediation Amount than the Remediation Amount claimed by Buyer in its applicable Environmental Defect Notice. The Environmental Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed Environmental Defects and Remediation Amounts submitted by either Party and may not award damages, interest or penalties to either Party with respect to any matter. Sellers and Buyer shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case. Each of Sellers and Buyer shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Environmental Arbitrator. To the extent that the award of the Environmental Arbitrator with respect to any Remediation Amount is not taken into account as an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 3.5 or Section 3.6, then, within ten days after the Environmental Arbitrator delivers written notice to Buyer and Sellers of his award with respect to any Remediation Amount, and subject to Section 12.1(d), (i) Buyer shall pay to Sellers the amount, if any, so awarded by the Environmental Arbitrator to Sellers, and (ii) Sellers shall pay to Buyer the amount, if any, so awarded by the Environmental Arbitrator to Buyer. Nothing herein shall operate to cause Closing to be delayed on account of any arbitration conducted pursuant to this Section 12.1(e). To the extent any adjustments are not agreed upon by the Parties as of Closing, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted therefor at Closing and the disputed Remediation Amounts asserted by Buyer in good faith to be deposited in an escrow account pursuant to a mutually agreeable escrow agreement. 12.2    NORM, Asbestos, Wastes and Other Substances. Buyer acknowledges that the Assets have been used for exploration, development and production of oil and gas and that there may be petroleum, produced water, wastes or other substances or materials located in, on or under the Assets or associated with the Assets. Equipment and sites included in the Assets may contain asbestos, NORM or other Hazardous Substances. NORM may affix or attach itself to the inside of wells, materials and equipment as scale, or in other forms. The wells, materials and equipment located on the Assets or included in the Assets may contain NORM, asbestos and other wastes or Hazardous Substances. NORM containing material and other wastes or Hazardous Substances may have come in contact with various environmental media, including, water, soils or sediment. Special procedures may be required for the assessment, remediation, removal, transportation, or disposal of environmental media, wastes, asbestos, NORM and other Hazardous Substances from the Assets. The presence of NORM, asbestos-containing materials that are non-friable, Hydrocarbons or Hazardous Substances cannot be claimed as an Environmental Defect, except to the extent constituting a violation of Environmental Laws.29Exhibit 10.1ARTICLE XIIIASSUMPTION; INDEMNIFICATION; SURVIVAL13.1    Assumed Obligations; Specified Obligations.

EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN SECTION 10.1(C), THE DEFENSE, INDEMNIFICATION, HOLD HARMLESS, RELEASE AND ASSUMED OBLIGATIONS PROVISIONS PROVIDED FOR IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE APPLICABLE WHETHER OR NOT THE LIABILITIES IN QUESTION AROSE OR RESULTED SOLELY OR IN PART FROM THE GROSS, SOLE, ACTIVE, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT OR VIOLATION OF LAW OF OR BY ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY. BUYER AND SELLERS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS STATEMENT COMPLIES WITH THE EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE RULE AND IS “CONSPICUOUS.”13.6    Exclusive Remedy. Except for causes of action based on actual fraud, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Parties agree that, from and after Closing, Section 10.1(c), Section 11.1(c), Section 13.2 and Section 13.3, contain the Parties’ exclusive remedies against each other with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, including breaches of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Parties contained in this Agreement or in any document or certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement. Except as specified in Section 11.1(c) and Section 13.2, effective as of Closing, Buyer, on its own behalf and on behalf of the Buyer Indemnified Parties, hereby releases, remises and forever discharges Sellers and their Affiliates and all of such Persons’ equityholders, partners, members, directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives from any and all suits, legal or administrative proceedings, Liabilities or interest whatsoever, in Law or in equity, known or unknown, which Buyer or the Buyer Indemnified Parties might now or subsequently have, based on, relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the ownership, use or operation of any of the Assets prior to Closing or the condition, quality, status or nature of any of the Assets prior to Closing, including rights to contribution under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, breaches of statutory or implied warranties, nuisance or other tort actions, rights to punitive damages, common law rights of contribution and rights under insurance maintained by Sellers or any of their Affiliates (except as provided in Section 11.3(b)).13.7    Indemnification Procedures. All claims for indemnification under Section 10.1(c), Section 13.2 and Section 13.3 shall be asserted and resolved as follows:(a)    For purposes of Section 10.1(c) and this Article XIII, the term “Indemnifying Party” when used in connection with particular Liabilities shall mean the Party or Parties having an obligation to indemnify another Party or Parties with respect to such Liabilities pursuant to Section 10.1(c) or this Article XIII, and the term “Indemnified Party” when used in connection with particular Liabilities shall mean the Party or Parties having the right to be indemnified with respect to such Liabilities by another Party or Parties pursuant to Section 10.1(c) or this Article XIII.(b)    To make claim for indemnification under Section 10.1(c), Section 13.2 and Section 13.3, an Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party of its claim under this Section 13.7, including the specific details of and specific basis under this Agreement for its claim (the “Claim Notice”). In the event that the claim for indemnification is based upon a claim by a Third Party against the Indemnified Party (a “Third Party Claim”), the Indemnified Party shall provide its Claim Notice promptly after the Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of the Third Party Claim and shall enclose a copy of all papers (if any) served with respect to the Third Party Claim; provided that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give notice of a Third Party Claim as provided in this Section 13.7(b) shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under Section 10.1(c), Section 13.2 or Section 13.3 (as applicable) except to the extent such failure results in insufficient time being available to permit the Indemnifying Party to effectively defend against the Third Party Claim or otherwise materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party’s ability to defend against the Third Party Claim. In the event that the claim for indemnification is based upon an inaccuracy or breach of a 32Exhibit 10.1representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, the Claim Notice shall specify the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that was inaccurate or breached.(c)    In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days from its receipt of the Claim Notice to notify the Indemnified Party whether it admits or denies its liability to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party is authorized, prior to and during such 30 day period, to file any motion, answer or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Party and that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party.(d)    If the Indemnifying Party admits its liability to defend the Indemnified Party against a Third Party Claim, it shall have the right and obligation to diligently defend, at its sole cost and expense, the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof. If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate in contesting any Third Party Claim which the Indemnifying Party elects to contest. The Indemnified Party may participate in, but not control, at its own expense, any defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 13.7(d). An Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnified Party, (i) settle any Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto which does not include an unconditional written release of the Indemnified Party from all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim or (ii) settle any Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto in any manner that may materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Party (other than as a result of money damages covered by the indemnity).(e)    If the Indemnifying Party does not admit its liability or admits its liability to defend the Indemnified Party against a Third Party Claim, but fails to diligently prosecute, indemnify against or settle the Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend against the Third Party Claim at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, with counsel of the Indemnified Party’s choosing, subject to the right of the Indemnifying Party to admit its liability and assume the defense of the Third Party Claim at any time prior to settlement or final determination thereof. If the Indemnifying Party has not yet admitted its liability to defend the Indemnified Party against a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall send written notice to the Indemnifying Party of any proposed settlement and the Indemnifying Party shall have the option for ten days following receipt of such notice to (i) admit in writing its liability to indemnify the Indemnified Party from and against the liability and consent to such settlement and (ii) if liability is so admitted, reject, in its reasonable judgment, the proposed settlement, or (iii) deny liability. Any failure by the Indemnifying Party to respond to such notice shall be deemed to be an election under subsection (i) above.(f)    In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days from its receipt of the Claim Notice to (i) cure the Liabilities complained of, (ii) admit its liability for such Liability or (iii) dispute the claim for such Liabilities. If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within such 30 day period that it has cured the Liabilities or that it disputes the claim for such Liabilities, the amount of such Liabilities shall conclusively be deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party hereunder. If the Indemnifying Party disputes the claim for such Liabilities, the running of any survival period for the claim shall be tolled.13.8    Survival. (a)    Except for the Specified Representations and the representations and warranties of Sellers in Section 4.15, the last sentence of Section 4.16 and Section 4.19, the representations and warranties 33Exhibit 10.1of the Parties in Article IV and Article V and the covenants and agreements of the Parties in Sections 6.1 shall survive Closing for the Survival Period.

Sellers’ indemnity in Section 13.2(c) (except as such indemnities relate to Specified Obligations described in Section 13.1(b)(iii)(A) or Section 13.1(b)(iii)(C), which shall survive Closing without time limit) shall survive Closing for the Survival Period.

None of the Buyer Indemnified Parties nor Seller Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover from Sellers or Buyer, as applicable, or their respective Affiliates, any loss of profits, special, indirect, consequential, punitive, exemplary, remote or speculative damages arising under or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, except to the extent any such Party suffers such damages to a Third Party, which damages (including costs of defense and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in connection with defending against such damages) shall not be excluded by this provision as to recovery hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, Buyer, on behalf of each of the Buyer Indemnified Parties, and Sellers, on behalf of each of Seller Indemnified Parties, each waive any right to recover any loss of profits, special, indirect, consequential, punitive, exemplary, remote or speculative damages arising in connection with or with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 34Exhibit 10.113.12    Disclaimer of Application of Anti-Indemnity Statutes.

The agreement to arbitrate any Dispute shall be binding on and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties and their Affiliates.

If either side fails to nominate an arbitrator within thirty (30) days of receipt of the request for arbitration, then that arbitrator shall be nominated by the Houston office of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The first two arbitrators nominated in accordance with this Section 13.13 shall nominate a third arbitrator within thirty (30) days after the appointment of the later-nominated of those two (2) arbitrators. If the first two arbitrators fail to nominate a third arbitrator within the time period prescribed above or if the nominated third arbitrator fails within ten (10) days after the time period prescribed above to accept his or her nomination, then the AAA shall appoint the third arbitrator and shall promptly notify the parties of the appointment. The third arbitrator shall act as chairman of the tribunal. (e)All arbitrators shall be and remain at all times independent and impartial, and, once appointed, no arbitrator shall have any ex parte communications with any of the Parties or any of their Affiliates concerning the arbitration or the underlying Dispute other than communications directly concerning the selection of the presiding arbitrator, when applicable.

(n)Any arbitration award may be recognized and enforced, and judgment on the award may be entered, by any court of competent jurisdiction. The Parties and their Affiliates agree to jointly request that any application for recognition or enforcement of an award be decided by the court on an expedited basis. All Parties and their Affiliates waive their right to appeal any court order confirming, recognizing, or enforcing an award to the maximum extent permitted by law. The Parties and their Affiliates do not waive any rights they may have to appeal a court order refusing to confirm, recognize, or enforce an award.ARTICLE XIVTERMINATION, DEFAULT AND REMEDIES14.1    Right of Termination.
