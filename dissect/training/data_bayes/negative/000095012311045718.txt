Gas Properties specified therein free and clear of any Liens (except Permitted Liens), (B) on and
as of the date of such Engineering Report each Oil and Gas Property described as proved developed
therein was properly classified in accordance with the PRMS, and (C) attached to the certificate is
a list of its Oil and Gas Properties added to and deleted from the immediately prior Engineering
Report and a list showing any change in working interest or net revenue interest in its Oil and Gas
Properties occurring.


(c) Interim Redetermination. In addition to the Borrowing Base redeterminations
provided for in Section 2.02(b), (i) the Borrower may request two additional redeterminations of
the Borrowing Base during any calendar year and (ii) the Supermajority Lenders may make one
additional redetermination of the Borrowing Base during any calendar year; provided,
however, that any increase in the Borrowing Base resulting from such a redetermination
shall require the consent of all the Lenders; and provided further, that such redeterminations
shall be in the Lenders sole discretion and shall be based on such information as the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders deem relevant (but in accordance with Section 2.02(d)). The
parties requesting the redetermination shall give the other parties at least 10 days prior written
notice that a redetermination of the Borrowing Base pursuant to this paragraph (c) is to be
performed. In connection with any redetermination of the Borrowing Base under this Section
2.02(c), the Borrower shall provide the Administrative Agent and the Lenders with such information
regarding the Credit Parties business (including, without limitation, its Oil and Gas Properties,
the Proved Reserves, and production relating thereto) as the Administrative Agent or any Lender may
request. In connection with such interim redeterminations, the Administrative Agent may request
the Borrower to deliver an updated Internal Engineering Report or Independent Engineering Report.
The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower in writing of each redetermination of
the Borrowing Base pursuant to this Section 2.02(c) and the amount of the Borrowing Base as so
redetermined.


(d) Standards for Redetermination. Each redetermination of the Borrowing Base by the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders pursuant to this Section 2.02 shall be made (i) in the sole
discretion of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders (but in accordance with the other provisions
of this Section 2.02(d)), (ii) in accordance with the Administrative Agents and the Lenders
customary internal standards and practices for valuing and redetermining the value of Oil and Gas
Properties in connection with reserve based oil and gas loan transactions, (iii) in conjunction
with the most recent Independent Engineering Report or Internal Engineering Report, as applicable,
or other information received by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders relating to the Proved
Reserves of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, and (iv) based upon the estimated value of the
Proved Reserves owned by the Borrower and its

 

24




 



Subsidiaries
as determined by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders. In valuing and redetermining the
Borrowing Base, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may also consider the business, financial
condition, and Debt obligations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and such other factors as the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders customarily deem appropriate. In that regard, the Borrower
acknowledges that the determination of the Borrowing Base contains an equity cushion (market value
in excess of loan value), which is essential for the adequate protection of the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders. At all times after the Administrative Agent has given the Borrower
notification of a redetermination of the Borrowing Base under this Section 2.02, the Borrowing Base
shall be equal to the redetermined amount or such lesser amount designated by the Borrower and
disclosed in writing to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders until the Borrowing Base is
subsequently redetermined in accordance with this Section 2.02.



(e) Borrowing Base Reduction Upon Monetization of Hydrocarbon Hedge Agreements. Upon
obtaining notice of any termination of a Hydrocarbon Hedge Agreement or the creation of any
offsetting position with respect to any Hydrocarbon Hedge Agreement, which Hydrocarbon Hedge
Agreement is, at the time of such termination or offset, (i) on a net basis in excess of 5% of the
Borrowing Base value and (ii) factored into the Administrative Agents calculation of the Borrowing
Base, the Supermajority Lenders may elect to reduce the Borrowing Base by an amount not to exceed
the Borrowing Base value of such Hydrocarbon Hedge Agreements to the extent so terminated or
offset, as such value is determined by the Administrative Agent, and any such election shall take
effect upon receipt of notice thereof by the Borrower.


Section 2.03 Method of Borrowing.


(a) Notice. Each Borrowing shall be made pursuant to a Notice of Borrowing (or by
telephone notice promptly confirmed in writing by a Notice of Borrowing), given not later than
12:00 noon (i) on the third Business Day before the date of the proposed Borrowing, in the case of
a Borrowing consisting of Eurodollar Rate Advances or (ii) on the Business Day of the proposed
Borrowing, in the case of a Borrowing consisting of Base Rate Advances, by the Borrower to the
Administrative Agent, which shall in turn give to each applicable Lender prompt notice of such
proposed Borrowing by telecopier or telex. Each Notice of a Borrowing shall be given by telecopier
or telex, confirmed immediately in writing, specifying the information required therein. In the
case of a proposed Borrowing comprised of Eurodollar Rate Advances, the Administrative Agent shall
promptly notify each applicable Lender of the applicable interest rate under Section 2.09(b). Each
applicable Lender shall, before 2:00 p.m. on the date of such Borrowing, make available to the
Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agents Office, or such other location as the
Administrative Agent may specify by notice to the Lenders, in same day funds, in the case of a
Borrowing, such Lenders Pro Rata Share of such Borrowing. After the Administrative Agents
receipt of such funds and upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article III,
the Administrative Agent shall make such funds available to the Borrower at its account with the
Administrative Agent.

 

25




 



(b) Conversions and Continuations. The Borrower may elect to Convert or continue any
Borrowing by delivering an irrevocable Notice of Conversion or Continuation to the Administrative
Agent at the Administrative Agents Office no later than 12:00 noon (i) on the date which is at
least three Business Days in advance of the proposed Conversion or continuation
date in the case of a Conversion to or a continuation of a Borrowing comprised of Eurodollar
Rate Advances and (ii) on the Business Day of the proposed Conversion in the case of a Conversion
to a Borrowing comprised of Base Rate Advances. Each such Notice of Conversion or Continuation
shall be in writing or by telex or telecopier confirmed immediately in writing specifying the
information required therein. Promptly after receipt of a Notice of Conversion or Continuation
under this Section, the Administrative Agent shall provide each Lender with notice thereof and, in
the case of a Conversion to or a continuation of a Borrowing comprised of Eurodollar Rate Advances,
notify each Lender of the applicable interest rate under Section 2.09(b).


(c) Certain Limitations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
paragraphs (a) and (b) above:


(i) at no time shall there be more than six Interest Periods applicable to outstanding
Eurodollar Rate Advances and the Borrower may not select Eurodollar Rate Advances for any Borrowing
at any time that a Default has occurred and is continuing;


(ii) if any Lender shall, at least one Business Day before the date of any requested
Borrowing, Conversion, or continuation, notify the Administrative Agent that the introduction of or
any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation makes it unlawful, or that any
central bank or other Governmental Authority asserts that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its
Eurodollar Lending Office to perform its obligations under this Agreement to make Eurodollar Rate
Advances or to fund or maintain Eurodollar Rate Advances, the right of the Borrower to select
Eurodollar Rate Advances from such Lender shall be suspended until such Lender shall notify the
Administrative Agent that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist, and the
Advance made by such Lender in respect of such Borrowing, Conversion, or continuation shall be a
Base Rate Advance;


(iii) if the Administrative Agent is unable to determine the Eurodollar Rate for Eurodollar
Rate Advances comprising any requested Borrowing, the right of the Borrower to select Eurodollar
Rate Advances for such Borrowing or for any subsequent Borrowing shall be suspended until the
Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such
suspension no longer exist, and each Advance comprising such Borrowing shall be a Base Rate
Advance; and


(iv) if the Borrower shall fail to select the duration or continuation of any Interest Period
for any Eurodollar Rate Advances in accordance with the provisions contained in the definition of
Interest Period in Section 1.01 and paragraph (b) above, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith
so notify the Borrower and the Lenders and such Advances shall be made available to the Borrower on
the date of such Borrowing as Base Rate Advances or, if an existing Advance, shall be Converted
into Base Rate Advances.


(d) Notices Irrevocable. Each Notice of Borrowing and Notice of Conversion or
Continuation shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower.

 

26




 



(e) Administrative Agent Reliance. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have
received notice from a Lender before the time of any Borrowing that such Lender shall not make
available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders Pro Rata Share of a Borrowing, the
Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made its Pro Rata Share of such Borrowing
available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with this
Agreement and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the
Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Lender shall not have
so made its Pro Rata Share of such Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender and
the Borrower severally agree to immediately repay to the Administrative Agent on demand such
corresponding amount, together with interest on such amount, for each day from the date such amount
is made available to the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent,
at (i) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable on such day to Advances comprising
such Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Rate for such day. If such
Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount and interest as provided
above, such corresponding amount so repaid shall constitute such Lenders Advance as part of such
Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement even though not made on the same day as the other Advances
comprising such Borrowing.


(f) Lender Obligations Several. The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make
Advances, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and to make payments pursuant to Section
10.04(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Advance, to fund any
such participation or to make any payment under Section 10.04(c) on any date required hereunder
shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no
Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Advance, to purchase
its participation or to make its payment under Section 10.04(c).


(g) Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent. If any Lender makes available to the
Administrative Agent funds for any Advance to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing
provisions of this Article II, and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the
Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Borrowing or L/C Extension set forth
in Article III are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative
Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without
interest.


Section 2.04 Reduction of the Commitments.


(a) The Borrower shall have the right, upon at least five Business Days irrevocable notice to
the Administrative Agent, to terminate in whole or reduce ratably in part the unused portion of the
Commitments; provided that each partial reduction shall be in the aggregate amount of
$1,000,000 or in integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.


(b) Any reduction and termination of the Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.04 shall be
applied ratably to each Lenders Commitment and shall be permanent, with no obligation of the
Lenders to reinstate such Commitments.

 

27




 



(c) Until the Commitment Termination Date, Borrower may, upon three (3) Business Days prior
written notice to Administrative Agent, reduce the Borrowing Base from the then designated amount
to any lesser amount, provided that the amount of any such reduction must be
equal to $5,000,000 or any higher integral multiple of $1,000,000. Such reduced Borrowing
Base shall be effective as of such third Business Day (or any later date as designated by Borrower
in such written notice) and shall continue in effect until the next date as of which the Borrowing
Base is redetermined. Any such reduction in the Borrowing Base shall remain in effect until the
next redetermination made in accordance with Section 2.02.


Section 2.05 Prepayment of Advances.


(a) Optional. The Borrower may prepay the Advances, without premium or penalty, after
giving by 12:00 noon (i) in the case of Eurodollar Rate Advances, at least three Business Days or
(ii) in the case of Base Rate Advances, on the same Business Day, irrevocable prior written notice
to the Administrative Agent stating the proposed date and aggregate principal amount of such
prepayment. If any such notice is given, the Borrower shall prepay the Advances in an aggregate
principal amount equal to the amount specified in such notice, together with accrued interest to
the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid and amounts, if any, required to be
paid pursuant to Section 2.12 as a result of such prepayment being made on such date;
provided, however, that each partial prepayment with respect to: (A) any
Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be applied to Eurodollar Rate Advances comprising part of the same
Borrowing; and (B) any Type of Advances shall be made in $1,000,000 and in integral multiples of
$500,000 in excess thereof (or the remaining aggregate principal balance outstanding). Full
prepayments of any Borrowing are permitted without restriction of amounts.


(b) Mandatory.


(i) Borrowing Base Deficiency. If a Borrowing Base Deficiency exists, then the
Administrative Agent shall give the Borrower and the Lenders prompt written notice thereof. The
Borrower shall, within ten days after receipt of written notice of such condition from the
Administrative Agent elect by written notice to the Administrative Agent to take one or more of the
following actions to remedy the Borrowing Base deficiency:



(A) prepay Advances or, if the Advances have been repaid in full, Cash
Collateralize the Letter of Credit Exposure in an aggregate amount equal to such
deficiency within 20 days after the Administrative Agents written notice;



(B) add additional Oil and Gas Properties acceptable to the Administrative
Agent, in its sole discretion, to the Borrowing Base such that the Borrowing Base
Deficiency is cured within 30 days after the Administrative Agents written notice;
or



(C) pay the Borrowing Base Deficiency in six equal monthly installments for the
prepayment of the Advances or, if the Advances have been repaid in full, make
deposits into the Cash Collateral Account to provide cash collateral for the Letter
of Credit Exposure such that the Borrowing Base Deficiency is eliminated in a period
of six months, and dedicate, to the extent necessary, an amount of the monthly cash
flow from the Borrowers and its Subsidiaries Oil and Gas Properties to the
prepayment of Advances or, if the
Advances have been repaid in full, make deposits into the Cash Collateral
Account to provide cash collateral for the Letter of Credit Exposure. The first
monthly installment under this Section 2.05(b)(i)(C) shall be paid within 20 days
after the Administrative Agents written notice.

 

28




 



(ii) Reduction of Commitments. On the date of each reduction of the aggregate
Commitments pursuant to Section 2.04, the Borrower agrees to make a prepayment in respect of the
outstanding amount of the Advances to the extent, if any, that the aggregate unpaid principal
amount of all Advances plus the Letter of Credit Exposure exceeds the lesser of (A) the
aggregate Commitments, as so reduced and (B) the Borrowing Base. Each prepayment pursuant to this
Section 2.05(b) shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the amount prepaid to the date of such
prepayment and amounts, if any, required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.12 as a result of such
prepayment being made on such date. Each prepayment under this Section 2.05(b) shall be applied to
the Advances as provided in Section 2.10(a).


(iii) Accrued Interest. Each prepayment under this Section 2.05(b) shall be
accompanied by accrued interest on the amount prepaid to the date of such prepayment and amounts,
if any, required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.12 as a result of such prepayment. Each
prepayment under this Section 2.05(b) shall be applied to the Advances in accordance with Section
2.10.


(c) Illegality. If any Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower
that any Change in Law makes it unlawful, or that any central bank or other Governmental Authority
asserts that it is unlawful for such Lender or its Eurodollar Lending Office to perform its
obligations under this Agreement to maintain any Eurodollar Rate Advances of such Lender then
outstanding hereunder, (i) the Borrower shall, no later than 12:00 noon (A) if not prohibited by
law, on the last day of the Interest Period for each outstanding Eurodollar Rate Advance made by
such Lender or (B) if required by such notice, on the second Business Day following its receipt of
such notice, prepay all of the Eurodollar Rate Advances made by such Lender then outstanding,
together with accrued interest on the principal amount prepaid to the date of such prepayment and
amounts, if any, required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.12 as a result of such prepayment being
made on such date, (ii) such Lender shall simultaneously make a Base Rate Advance to the Borrower
on such date in an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Eurodollar Rate Advances
prepaid to such Lender, and (iii) the right of the Borrower to select Eurodollar Rate Advances from
such Lender for any subsequent Borrowing shall be suspended until such Lender gives notice referred
to above shall notify the Administrative Agent that the circumstances causing such suspension no
longer exist.


(d) No Additional Right; Ratable Prepayment. The Borrower shall have no right to
prepay any principal amount of any Advance except as provided in this Section 2.05, and all notices
given pursuant to this Section 2.05 shall be irrevocable and binding upon the Borrower. Each
payment of any Advance pursuant to this Section 2.05 shall be made in a manner such that all
Advances comprising part of the same Borrowing are paid in whole or ratably in part.


Section 2.06 Repayment of Advances. The Borrower shall repay to the Administrative
Agent for the ratable benefit of the Lenders the outstanding principal amount of each Advance,
together with any accrued interest on the Maturity Date or such earlier date pursuant to
Section 7.02 or Section 7.03.

 

29




 



Section 2.07 Letters of Credit.


(a) Letter of Credit Commitment.


(i) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, (A) the Issuing Lender agrees, in
reliance upon the agreements of the Lenders set forth in this Section 2.07, (1) from time to time
on any Business Day during the period from the Closing Date until 30 days prior to the Commitment
Termination Date, to issue Letters of Credit for the account of the Borrower, and to amend or
extend Letters of Credit previously issued by it, in accordance with subsection (b) below, and (2)
to honor drawings under the Letters of Credit; and (B) the Lenders severally agree to participate
in Letters of Credit issued for the account of the Borrower and any drawings thereunder;
provided that after giving effect to any L/C Credit Extension with respect to any Letter of
Credit, the Letter of Credit Exposure shall not exceed the lesser of (A) the Letter of Credit
Sublimit and (B) the Unused Commitment Amount. Each request by the Borrower for the issuance or
amendment of a Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be a representation by the Borrower that the L/C
Credit Extension so requested complies with the conditions set forth in the proviso to the
preceding sentence. Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the terms and conditions hereof,
the Borrowers ability to obtain Letters of Credit shall be fully revolving, and accordingly the
Borrower may, during the foregoing period, obtain Letters of Credit to replace Letters of Credit
that have expired or that have been drawn upon and reimbursed.


(ii) The Issuing Lender shall not issue any Letter of Credit, if:



(A) Subject to Section 2.07(b)(iii), the expiry date of such requested Letter
of Credit would occur more than 12 months after the date of issuance or last
extension, unless the Majority Lenders have approved such expiry date; or



(B) The expiry date of such requested Letter of Credit would occur after the
Letter of Credit Expiration Date, unless all the Lenders have approved such expiry
date.


(iii) The Issuing Lender shall not be under any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if:



(A) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator
shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the Issuing Lender from issuing
such Letter of Credit, or any Legal Requirement applicable to the Issuing Lender or
any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any
Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the Issuing Lender shall prohibit, or
request that the Issuing Lender refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit
generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon the Issuing
Lender with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital
requirement (for which the Issuing Lender is not otherwise compensated hereunder)
not in effect on the Closing Date, or shall impose upon
the Issuing Lender any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not
applicable on the Closing Date and which the Issuing Lender in good faith deems
material to it;

 

30




 




(B) the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate one or more policies of
the Issuing Lender applicable to letters of credit generally;



(C) except as otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent and the Issuing
Lender, such Letter of Credit is in an initial face amount less than $100,000, in
the case of a commercial Letter of Credit, or $500,000, in the case of a standby
Letter of Credit;



(D) such Letter of Credit is to be denominated in a currency other than
Dollars;



(E) such Letter of Credit contains any provisions for automatic reinstatement
of the stated amount after any drawing thereunder; or



(F) any Lender is at that time a Defaulting Lender, unless the Issuing Lender
has entered into arrangements, including the delivery of Cash Collateral,
satisfactory to the Issuing Lender (in its sole discretion) with the Borrower or
such Lender to eliminate the Issuing Lenders actual or potential risk with respect
to the Defaulting Lender arising from either the Letter of Credit then proposed to
be issued or that Letter of Credit as to which the Issuing Lender has actual or
potential Fronting Exposure, as it may elect in its sole discretion.


(iv) The Issuing Lender shall not amend any Letter of Credit if the Issuing Lender would not
be permitted at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms
hereof.


(v) The Issuing Lender shall be under no obligation to amend any Letter of Credit if (A) the
Issuing Lender would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its amended
form under the terms hereof, or (B) the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit does not accept the
proposed amendment to such Letter of Credit.


(vi) The Issuing Lender shall act on behalf of the Lenders with respect to any Letters of
Credit issued by it and the documents associated therewith, and the Issuing Lender shall have all
of the benefits and immunities (A) provided to the Administrative Agent in Article IX with respect
to any acts taken or omissions suffered by the Issuing Lender in connection with Letters of Credit
issued by it or proposed to be issued by it and Letter of Credit Documents pertaining to such
Letters of Credit as fully as if the term Administrative Agent as used in Article IX included the
Issuing Lender with respect to such acts or omissions, and (B) as additionally provided herein with
respect to the Issuing Lender.

 

31




 



(b) Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit; Auto-Extension Letters of
Credit.


(i) Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended, as the case may be, upon the request of
the Borrower delivered to the Issuing Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) in the form
of a Letter of Credit Application, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of
the Borrower. Such Letter of Credit Application must be received by the Issuing Lender and the
Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. at least two Business Days (or such later date and
time as the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender may agree in a particular instance in their
sole discretion) prior to the proposed issuance date or date of amendment, as the case may be. In
the case of a request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit
Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the Issuing Lender: (A) the proposed
issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (B) the amount
thereof; (C) the expiry date thereof; (D) the name and address of the beneficiary thereof; (E) the
documents to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (F) the full text
of any certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (G) the
purpose and nature of the requested Letter of Credit and (H) such other matters as the Issuing
Lender may require. In the case of a request for an amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit,
such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the Issuing
Lender (A) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (B) the proposed date of amendment thereof (which
shall be a Business Day); (C) the nature of the proposed amendment; and (D) such other matters as
the Issuing Lender may require. Additionally, the Borrower shall furnish to the Issuing Lender and
the Administrative Agent such other documents and information pertaining to such requested Letter
of Credit issuance or amendment, including any Letter of Credit Documents, as the Issuing Lender or
the Administrative Agent may require.


(ii) Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit Application, the Issuing Lender will
confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent
has received a copy of such Letter of Credit Application from the Borrower and, if not, the Issuing
Lender will provide the Administrative Agent with a copy thereof. Unless the Issuing Lender has
received written notice from any Lender, the Administrative Agent or any Credit Party, at least one
Business Day prior to the requested date of issuance or amendment of the applicable Letter of
Credit, that one or more applicable conditions contained in Article III shall not then be
satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Issuing Lender shall, on the
requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for the account of the Borrower or enter into the
applicable amendment, as the case may be, in each case in accordance with the Issuing Lenders
usual and customary business practices. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit,
each Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from
the Issuing Lender a risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the product
of such Lenders Pro Rata Share times the amount of such Letter of Credit.


(iii) If the Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Application, the Issuing
Lender may, in its sole and absolute discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has
automatic extension provisions (each, an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit);
provided that any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit must permit the Issuing Lender to
prevent any such extension at least once in each twelve-month period (commencing with the date of
issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than
a day (the Non-Extension Notice Date) in each such twelve-month period to be agreed upon
at the

 

32




 



time such Letter of Credit is issued. Unless otherwise directed by the Issuing Lender, the
Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to the Issuing Lender for any such extension.
Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have
authorized (but may not require) the Issuing Lender to permit the extension of such Letter of
Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date;
provided, however, that the Issuing Lender shall not permit any such extension if
(A) the Issuing Lender has determined that it would not be permitted, or would have no obligation,
at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its revised form (as extended) under the terms
hereof (by reason of the provisions of clause (ii) or (iii) of Section 2.07(a) or otherwise), or
(B) it has received notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is
seven Business Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date (1) from the Administrative Agent that the
Majority Lenders have elected not to permit such extension or (2) from the Administrative Agent,
any Lender or the Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 3.02
is not then satisfied, and in each such case directing the Issuing Lender not to permit such
extension.



(iv) Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of
Credit to an advising bank with respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the Issuing Lender
will also deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such
Letter of Credit or amendment.


(c) Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations.


(i) Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any notice of a drawing under
such Letter of Credit, the Issuing Lender shall notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent
thereof. Not later than 11:00 a.m. on the date of any payment by the Issuing Lender under a Letter
of Credit (each such date, an Honor Date), the Borrower shall reimburse the Issuing
Lender through the Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing. If the
Borrower fails to so reimburse the Issuing Lender by such time, the Administrative Agent shall
promptly notify each Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (the
Unreimbursed Amount), and the amount of such Lenders Pro Rata Share thereof. In such
event, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Borrowing of Base Rate Advances to be
disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the
minimum and multiples specified in Section 2.01 for the principal amount of Base Rate Advances, but
subject to the Unused Commitment Amount and the conditions set forth in Section 3.02 (other than
the delivery of a Notice of Borrowing). Any notice given by the Issuing Lender or the
Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.07(c)(i) may be given by telephone if immediately
confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not
affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice.


(ii) Each Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to Section 2.07(c)(i) make funds available
(and the Administrative Agent may apply Cash Collateral provided for this purpose) to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender at the Administrative Agents Office in
an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 1:00 p.m. on the
Business Day specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the
provisions of Section 2.07(c)(iii), each Lender that so makes funds
available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Advance to the Borrower in such amount.
The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the Issuing Lender.

 

33




 



(iii) With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Borrowing of
Base Rate Advances because the conditions set forth in Section 3.02 cannot be satisfied or for any
other reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the Issuing Lender an L/C
Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing
shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Base
Rate plus the Applicable Margin applicable to Base Rate Advances plus 2% per annum. In such event,
each Lenders payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender pursuant to
Section 2.07(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing
and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation
obligation under this Section 2.07.


(iv) Until each Lender funds its Advance or L/C Advance pursuant to this Section 2.07(c) to
reimburse the Issuing Lender for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect
of such Lenders Pro Rata Share of such amount shall be solely for the account of the Issuing
Lender.


(v) Each Lenders obligation to make Advances or L/C Advances to reimburse the Issuing Lender
for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this Section 2.07(c), shall be
absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff,
counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the Issuing
Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or
continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar
to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that each Lenders obligation to make
Advances pursuant to this Section 2.07(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 3.02
(other than delivery by the Borrower of a Notice of Borrowing). No such making of an L/C Advance
shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the Issuing Lender
for the amount of any payment made by the Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit, together with
interest as provided herein.


(vi) If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the
Issuing Lender any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions
of this Section 2.07(c) by the time specified in Section 2.07(c)(ii), the Issuing Lender shall be
entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such
amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on
which such payment is immediately available to the Issuing Lender at a rate per annum equal to the
greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Issuing Lender in accordance with
banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar
fees customarily charged by the Issuing Lender in connection with the foregoing. If such Lender
pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such
Lenders Advance included in the relevant Borrowing or L/C Advance in respect of the relevant L/C
Borrowing, as the case may be. A certificate of the Issuing Lender submitted to any Lender
(through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (vi) shall
be conclusive absent manifest error.

 

34




 



(d) Repayment of Participations.


(i) At any time after the Issuing Lender has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has
received from any Lender such Lenders L/C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with
Section 2.07(c), if the Administrative Agent receives for the account of the Issuing Lender any
payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from
the Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the
Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such Lender its Pro Rata Share
thereof (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time
during which such Lenders L/C Advance was outstanding) in the same funds as those received by the
Administrative Agent.


(ii) If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender
pursuant to Section 2.07(c)(i) is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described
in Section 10.17 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Issuing Lender in its
discretion), each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing
Lender its Pro Rata Share thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from
the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum
equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. The obligations of the Lenders under
this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this
Agreement.


(e) Obligations Absolute. The obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the Issuing
Lender for each drawing under each Letter of Credit and to repay each L/C Borrowing shall be
absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement under all circumstances, including the following:


(i) any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit, this Agreement, or any
other Loan Document;


(ii) the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other right that the
Borrower or any Subsidiary may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such
Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be
acting), the Issuing Lender or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument
relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction;


(iii) any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such Letter of Credit
proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein
being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of
any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit;

 

35




 



(iv) any payment by the Issuing Lender under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a
draft or certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any
payment made by the Issuing Lender under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a
trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of
creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or
any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceeding
under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or similar law affecting
creditors rights generally and by general principles of equity; or


(v) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the
foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to,
or a discharge of, the Borrower or any Subsidiary.


The Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and each amendment thereto
that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of noncompliance with the Borrowers
instructions or other irregularity, the Borrower will immediately notify the Issuing Lender. The
Borrower shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against the Issuing Lender and
its correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid.


(f) Role of Issuing Lender. Each Lender and the Borrower agree that, in paying any
drawing under a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Lender shall not have any responsibility to obtain
any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the
Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or
the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of the Issuing Lender,
the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent,
participant or assignee of the Issuing Lender shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action
taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Lenders or the
Majority Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross
negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or
enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Letter of Credit
Document. The Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or
transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit; provided, however, that
this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Borrowers pursuing such rights and
remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement.
None of the Issuing Lender, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor
any correspondent, participant or assignee of the Issuing Lender shall be liable or responsible for
any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (v) of Section 2.07(e); provided,
however, that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower may
have a claim against the Issuing Lender, and the Issuing Lender may be liable to the Borrower, to
the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary,
damages suffered by the Borrower which the Borrower proves were caused by the Issuing Lenders
willful misconduct or gross negligence or the Issuing Lenders willful failure to pay under any
Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and
certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Issuing Lender may accept documents that
appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless
of any notice or information to the contrary, and the Issuing Lender shall not be responsible for
the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer
or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or
in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason.

 

36




 



(g) Cash Collateral. Upon the request of the Administrative Agent, (i) if the Issuing
Lender has honored any full or partial drawing request under any Letter of Credit and such drawing
has resulted in an L/C Borrowing, or (ii) if, as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any
Letter of Credit Exposure for any reason remains outstanding, the Borrower shall, in each case,
immediately Cash Collateralize the then outstanding Letter of Credit Exposure after giving effect
to any L/C Credit Extensions occurring on such date and any other changes in the aggregate amount
of the Letter of Credit Exposure as of such date, including as a result of any reimbursements by
the Borrower of Unreimbursed Amounts. Sections 2.05, 7.02(b) or 7.03(b) set forth certain
additional requirements to deliver Cash Collateral hereunder. For purposes of this Section 2.05,
Section 2.07, Section 7.02(b) and Section 7.03(b), Cash Collateralize means to pledge and deposit
with or deliver to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Issuing Lender and the Lenders,
as collateral for the Letter of Credit Exposure, cash or deposit account balances pursuant to
documentation in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the
Issuing Lender (which documents are hereby consented to by the Lenders). Cash Collateral shall
have a meaning correlative to the foregoing and shall include the proceeds of such cash collateral
and other credit support. Derivatives of such term have corresponding meanings. The Borrower
hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Issuing Lender and the Lenders, a
security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein and all proceeds of
the foregoing. Cash Collateral shall be maintained in blocked, non-interest bearing deposit
accounts at Bank of America.


(h) Applicability of ISP and UCP. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the Issuing
Lender and the Borrower when a Letter of Credit is issued, (i) the rules of the ISP shall apply to
each standby Letter of Credit, and (ii) the rules of the Uniform Customs and Practice for
Documentary Credits, as most recently published by the International Chamber of Commerce at the
time of issuance shall apply to each commercial Letter of Credit.


(i) Conflict with Issuer Documents. In the event of any conflict between the terms
hereof and the terms of any Letter of Credit Document, the terms hereof shall control.


Section 2.08 Fees.


(a) Commitment Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the
account of each Lender a commitment fee at a per annum rate equal to the Applicable Margin for
commitment fees on the actual daily Unused Commitment Amount of such Lender, from the date of this
Agreement until the Commitment Termination Date. The commitment fees shall be due and payable
quarterly in arrears on the last day of each March, June, September, and December commencing on
March 31, 2011 and continuing thereafter through and including the Commitment Termination Date.

 

37




 



(b) Letter of Credit Fees.


(i) Letter of Credit Fee. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for
the account of each Lender in accordance with its Pro Rata Share a Letter of Credit fee (the
Letter of Credit Fee) equal to the Applicable Margin for Eurodollar Rate Advances times
the daily maximum amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit (calculated in
accordance with Section 1.07). Such fee will be calculated based on the face amount of all
Letters of Credit outstanding on each day at the above applicable rate and will be payable
quarterly in arrears. Letter of Credit Fees shall be (i) computed on a quarterly basis in arrears
and (ii) due and payable on the first Business Day after the end of each March, June, September and
December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit,
on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand. If there is any change in the
Applicable Rate during any quarter, the daily maximum amount of each Letter of Credit shall be
computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that
such Applicable Rate was in effect. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
upon the request of the Majority Lenders, while any Event of Default exists, all Letter of Credit
Fees shall accrue at the Applicable Margin plus 2.00%.


(ii) Fronting Fee and Documentary and Processing Charges Payable to Issuing Lender.
The Borrower shall pay directly to the Issuing Lender for its own account a fronting fee with
respect to each Letter of Credit, at the rate per annum of 0.125%, computed on the actual daily
maximum amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit (whether or not such maximum
amount is then in effect under such Letter of Credit) and on a quarterly basis in arrears, and due
and payable on the first Business Day after the end of each March, June, September and December,
commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the
Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand. In addition, the Borrower shall pay
directly to the Issuing Lender for its own account the customary issuance, presentation, amendment
and other processing fees, and other standard costs and charges, of the Issuing Lender relating to
letters of credit as from time to time in effect. Such customary fees and standard costs and
charges are due and payable on demand and are nonrefundable.


(c) Other Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Lead Arranger and the
Administrative Agent the fees described in the Administrative Agents Fee Letter.


Section 2.09 Interest. The Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount
of each Advance made by each Lender from the date of such Advance until such principal amount shall
be paid in full, at the following rates per annum:


(a) Base Rate Advances. If such Advance is a Base Rate Advance, a rate per annum
equal at all times to the Base Rate in effect from time to time plus the Applicable Margin
in effect from time to time, payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each calendar quarter
and on the date such Base Rate Advance shall be paid in full, provided that upon the
request of the Majority Lenders, while any Event of Default exists, such Advances shall bear
interest from the date on which such Event of Default occurred until such Event of Default has been
cured or waived, payable on demand, at a rate per annum equal at all times to the Base Rate in
effect from time to time plus the Applicable Margin plus 2.00%, provided
further that the rate charged pursuant to this Section 2.09(a) shall never exceed the
Maximum Rate.

 

38




 



(b) Eurodollar Rate Advances. If such Advance is a Eurodollar Rate Advance, a rate
per annum equal at all times during the Interest Period for such Advance to the Eurodollar Rate for
such Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin in effect from time to time, payable on the
last day of such Interest Period, and, in the case of six-month Interest Periods, on the day which
occurs during such Interest Period three months from the first day of such Interest Period,
provided that upon the request of the Majority Lenders, while any Event of Default
exists, such Advance shall bear interest from the date on which such Event of Default occurred
until such Event of Default has been cured or waived (or until such Advance is Converted into a
Base Rate Advance bearing interest as provided in subsection (a) above), payable on demand, at a
rate per annum equal at all times to the rate required to be paid on such Advance immediately prior
to the occurrence of such Event of Default plus 2.00%, provided further
that the rate charged pursuant to this Section 2.09(b) shall never exceed the Maximum Rate.


(c) Additional Interest on Eurodollar Rate Advances. The Borrower shall pay to each
Lender, so long as any such Lender shall be required under regulations of the Federal Reserve Board
to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency
Liabilities, additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Rate Advance of
such Lender, from the effective date of such Advance until such principal amount is paid in full,
at an interest rate per annum equal at all times to the remainder obtained by subtracting (i) the
Eurodollar Rate for the Interest Period for such Advance from (ii) the rate obtained by dividing
such Eurodollar Rate by a percentage equal to 100% minus the Eurodollar Rate Reserve Percentage of
such Lender for such Interest Period, payable on each date on which interest is payable on such
Advance. Such additional interest payable to any Lender shall be determined by such Lender and
notified to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent (such notice to include the calculation
of such additional interest, which calculation shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest
error).


(d) Usury Recapture. If the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall receive interest
in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal
of the Advances or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower. In determining
whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or a Lender
exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirement,
(i) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than
interest, (ii) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (iii) amortize, prorate,
allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the
contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder.


Section 2.10 Payments and Computations.


(a) Payment Procedures. All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made without
condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. The Borrower shall
make each payment under this Agreement and under the Notes not later than 2:00 p.m. on the day when
due in Dollars at the Administrative Agents Office in same day funds. The Administrative Agent
shall promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal,
interest or fees ratably (other than amounts payable solely to the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Lender, or a specific Lender pursuant to Section 2.08(b), 2.08(c), 2.09(c), 2.12, 2.13,
2.14, 9.05, or 10.07, but after taking into account payments effected pursuant to Section 10.04) in
accordance with each Lenders Pro Rata Share to the Lenders for the account of their respective
Applicable Lending Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to
any Lender or the Issuing Lender to such Lender for the account of its Applicable Lending Office,
in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. All payments received
by the Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m. shall be
deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall
continue to accrue.

 

39




 



(b) Computations. All computations of interest based on the Base Rate shall be made
by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and all
computations of interest based on the Eurodollar Rate and the Federal Funds Rate and of fees shall
be made by the Administrative Agent, on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the
actual number of days (including the first day, but excluding the last day) occurring in the period
for which such interest or fees are payable. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an
interest rate or fee shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.


(c) Non-Business Day Payments. Whenever any payment shall be stated to be due on a
day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and
such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or
fees, as the case may be; provided, however, that if such extension would cause
payment of interest on or principal of Eurodollar Rate Advances to be made in the next following
calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day.


(d) (i) Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent. Unless the
Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed time of any
Advance that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders share of
such Advance, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on
such date in accordance with Section 2.02 and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available
to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share
of the applicable Advance available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the
Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding
amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the
date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the
Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the
Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking
industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees
customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the
case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Advances.
If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or
an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of
such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the
applicable Advance to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such
Lenders Advance included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without
prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such
payment to the Administrative Agent.

 

40




 



(ii) Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent. Unless the
Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any
payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Lender
hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may
assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in
reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be,
the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the
Lenders or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative
Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the Issuing Lender, in
immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such
amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at
the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in
accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.


A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount
owing under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.


Section 2.11 Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any Lender shall obtain any payment
(whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on
account of the Advances or Letter of Credit Exposure made by it in excess of its Pro Rata Share of
payments on account of the Advances or Letter of Credit Exposure obtained by all the Lenders, such
Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent and forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such
participations in the Advances made by them or Letter of Credit Exposure held by them as shall be
necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them;
provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter
recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such
Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such Lenders
ratable share (according to the proportion of (a) the amount of the participation sold by such
Lender to the purchasing Lender as a result of such excess payment to (b) the total amount of such
excess payment) of such recovery, together with an amount equal to such Lenders ratable share
(according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lenders required repayment to the
purchasing Lender to (ii) the total amount of all such required repayments to the purchasing
Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the
total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from
another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.11 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise
all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as
fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such
participation.


Section 2.12 Breakage Costs. If (a) any default by the Borrower in making any
borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of any Eurodollar Rate Advance after the Borrower has
given a notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (b) any
payment of any Eurodollar Rate Advance is made prior to the last day of the Interest Period for
such Advance, whether as a result of any payment pursuant to Section 2.05, the acceleration of the
maturity of the Notes pursuant to Article VII, or otherwise, or (c) any default by the Borrower in
making any prepayment of any Eurodollar Rate Advance after the Borrower has given notice thereof in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, the Borrower shall, within 10 days of any written
demand sent by any Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender any amounts required to compensate such Lender
for any additional losses, out-of-pocket costs or expenses which it may reasonably incur as a
result of such payment or nonpayment,
including, without limitation, any loss, cost, or expense incurred by reason of the
liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund or maintain
such Advance.

 

41




 



Section 2.13 Increased Costs.


(a) Eurodollar Rate Advances. If, due to either (i) the introduction of or any change
(other than any change by way of imposition or increase of reserve requirements included in the
Eurodollar Rate Reserve Percentage) in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii)
the compliance with any guideline or request from any central bank or other Governmental Authority
(whether or not having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the cost to any Lender of
agreeing to make or making, funding, or maintaining Eurodollar Rate Advances, then the Borrower
shall from time to time, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the
Administrative Agent), immediately pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender
additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender for such increased cost. A certificate as
to the amount of such increased cost and detailing the calculation of such cost submitted to the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent by such Lender shall be conclusive and binding for all
purposes, absent manifest error.


(b) Capital Adequacy. If any Lender or the Issuing Lender determines in good faith
that compliance with any law or regulation or any guideline or request from any central bank or
other Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law) affects or would affect the
amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender or the Issuing Lender or any
corporation controlling such Lender or the Issuing Lender and that the amount of such capital is
increased by or based upon the existence of such Lenders commitment to lend or the Issuing
Lenders commitment to issue the Letters of Credit and other commitments of this type, then, upon
30 days prior written notice by such Lender or the Issuing Lender (with a copy of any such demand
to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall immediately pay to the Administrative Agent for
the account of such Lender or to the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, from time to time as
specified by such Lender or the Issuing Lender, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such
Lender or the Issuing Lender for the reduced rate of return on that capital of such Lender or the
Issuing Lender (but without duplication of amounts, if any, paid by the Borrower pursuant to
Section 2.13(a) above), in light of such circumstances, (i) with respect to such Lender, to the
extent that such Lender reasonably determines such increase in capital to be allocable to the
existence of such Lenders commitment to lend under this Agreement and (ii) with respect to the
Issuing Lender, to the extent that the Issuing Lender reasonably determines such increase in
capital to be allocable to the issuance or maintenance of the Letters of Credit. A certificate as
to such amounts and detailing the calculation of such amounts submitted to the Borrower by such
Lender or the Issuing Lender shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest
error.

 

42




 



(c) Letters of Credit. If any change in any law or regulation or in the
interpretation thereof by any court or administrative or Governmental Authority charged with the
administration thereof shall either (i) impose, modify, or deem applicable any reserve, special
deposit, or similar requirement against letters of credit issued by, or assets held by, or deposits
in or for the account of, the Issuing Lender or (ii) impose on the Issuing Lender any other
condition regarding the provisions of this Agreement relating to the Letters of Credit or any
Letter of
Credit Exposure, and the result of any event referred to in the preceding clause (i) or (ii)
shall be to increase the cost to the Issuing Lender of issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit
(which increase in cost shall be determined by the Issuing Lenders reasonable allocation of the
aggregate of such cost increases resulting from such event), then, upon demand by the Issuing
Lender, the Borrower shall pay to the Issuing Lender, from time to time as specified by the Issuing
Lender, additional amounts which shall be sufficient to compensate the Issuing Lender for such
increased cost. A certificate as to such increased cost incurred by the Issuing Lender, as a
result of any event mentioned in clause (i) or (ii) above, and detailing the calculation of such
increased costs submitted by the Issuing Lender to the Borrower, shall be conclusive and binding
for all purposes, absent manifest error.


Section 2.14 Taxes.


(a) No Deduction for Certain Taxes. Any and all payments by the Borrower shall be
made, in accordance with Section 2.10, free and clear of and without deduction for any and all
present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities
with respect thereto, excluding, in the case of each Lender, the Issuing Lender, and the
Administrative Agent, (i) taxes imposed on its net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by
the jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender, the Issuing Lender, or the Administrative
Agent (as the case may be) is organized or otherwise resides for tax purposes or maintains any
Applicable Lending Office or any political subdivision of the jurisdiction, (ii) any branch profits
taxes imposed by the United States of America or any similar tax imposed by another jurisdiction in
which the Borrower is located, and (iii) any withholding or similar taxes imposed by the United
States of America pursuant to laws in effect as of the date the Lender or the Issuing Lender
becomes a party to this Agreement, or pursuant to FATCA, upon any payments to or for the benefit of
such Lender or Issuing Lender under this Agreement (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts,
deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities being herein referred to as Taxes) and
also excluding, in the case of each Lender and the Issuing Lender, Taxes by the jurisdiction of
such Lenders Applicable Lending Office or any political subdivision of such jurisdiction. If the
Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable to any
Lender, the Issuing Lender, or the Administrative Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as
may be necessary so that, after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to
additional sums payable under this Section 2.14), such Lender, the Issuing Lender, or the
Administrative Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have
received had no such deductions been made; provided, however, that if the
Borrowers obligation to deduct or withhold Taxes is caused solely by such Lenders, the Issuing
Lenders, or the Administrative Agents failure to provide the forms described in paragraph (d) of
this Section 2.14 and such Lender, the Issuing Lender, or the Administrative Agent could have
provided such forms, no such increase shall be required; (ii) the Borrower shall make such
deductions; and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation
authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law. After a Lender or the Issuing
Lender learns of the imposition of Taxes, such Lender or Issuing Lender will promptly notify
Borrower of such Taxes.


(b) Other Taxes. In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any present or future stamp
or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies which arise
from any payment made or from the execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise with
respect to, this Agreement, the Notes, or the other Loan Documents (herein referred to as
Other Taxes).

 

43




 



(c) Indemnification. The Borrower indemnifies each Lender, the Issuing Lender, and
the Administrative Agent for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without
limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this
Section 2.14) paid by such Lender, the Issuing Lender, or the Administrative Agent (as the case may
be) and any liability (including interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto,
whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted unless the payment of
such Taxes or Other Taxes were not correctly or legal asserted and such Lenders payment of such
Taxes or Other Taxes was the result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. Each payment
required to be made by the Borrower in respect of this indemnification shall be made to the
Administrative Agent for the benefit of any party claiming such indemnification within 30 days from
the date the Borrower receives written demand therefor from the Administrative Agent on behalf of
itself as Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender, or any such Lender. Within 30 days after
receipt of a written request by Borrower, a Lender or the Issuing Lender shall, at Borrowers
expense, make a claim to an applicable Governmental Authority for a refund if, in the judgment of
such Lender or Issuing Lender, the making of such claim will not be adverse to it in respect of any
Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by Borrower under this Section 2.14. If any Lender, the
Administrative Agent, or the Issuing Lender receives a refund in respect of any Taxes paid by the
Borrower under this Section 2.14, such Lender, the Administrative Agent, or the Issuing Lender, as
the case may be, shall promptly pay to the Borrower the Borrowers share of such refund. This
paragraph shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing
Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes) to the
Borrower or any other Person.


(d) Foreign Lender Withholding Exemption. Each Lender and Issuing Lender that is not
incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof agrees that upon the
request of the Borrower it shall, to the extent it is able to do so in accordance with applicable
law, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (i) two duly completed copies of United
States Internal Revenue Service Form W8-ECI, W8-IMY or W8-BEN or successor applicable
form, as the case may be, certifying in each case that such Lender is entitled to receive payments
under this Agreement and the Notes payable to it, without deduction or withholding of any United
States federal income taxes, (ii) if applicable, an Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or successor
applicable form, as the case may be, to establish an exemption from United States backup
withholding tax, and (iii) any other governmental forms which are necessary or required under an
applicable tax treaty or otherwise by law to reduce or eliminate any withholding tax, which have
been reasonably requested by the Borrower. Each Lender further agrees to deliver to Borrower and
the Administrative Agent (i) renewals or additional copies of such forms (or any successor forms)
on or before the date that such forms expire or become obsolete, and (ii) after the occurrence of
any event requiring a change in the most recent forms so delivered by it, such additional forms or
amendments thereto as may be reasonably requested by Borrower. The Borrower shall withhold tax at
the rate and in the manner required by the laws of the United States with respect to payments made
to a Lender failing to timely provide the requisite Internal Revenue Service forms. For any period
with respect to which a Lender or the Issuing Lender has failed to

 

44




 



provide the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent with the appropriate form pursuant to this Section 2.14(d), such Lender or the Issuing Lender,
as applicable, shall not be entitled to indemnification under Section 2.14(c) with respect to Taxes
imposed by the United States which taxes would not have been imposed but for such failure to
provide such forms; provided, however that should a Lender, which is otherwise
exempt from or subject to a reduced rate of withholding tax becomes subject to Taxes because of its
failure to deliver a form required hereunder, the Borrower shall take such steps as such Lender
shall reasonable request to assist such Lender to recover such Taxes. If a payment made to a
Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if
such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including
those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall
deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law and at
such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such
documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of
the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply
with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such
Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such
payment.

ARTICLE IV



REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES


Each Credit Party jointly and severally represents and warrants as follows:


Section 4.01 Corporate Existence; Subsidiaries. Each of the Credit Parties is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
formation and in good standing and qualified to do business in each jurisdiction where its
ownership or lease of Property or conduct of its business requires such qualification and where the
failure to so qualify could reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse Change. As of the
Closing Date, the Credit Parties have no Subsidiaries other than those listed on Schedule
4.01.


Section 4.02 Corporate Power. The execution, delivery, and performance by each Credit
Party of this Agreement, the Notes, and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (a) are within such Credit Partys
powers, (b) have been duly authorized by all necessary governing action, (c) do not (i) contravene
such Credit Partys governance documents or (ii) contravene in any material respect any Legal
Requirement, the Senior Note Indenture or any other material contractual restriction binding on or
affecting such Credit Party, and (d) will not result in or require the creation or imposition of
any Lien upon any of the material Property of any Credit Party prohibited by this Agreement. At
the time of each Advance, such Advance and the use of the proceeds of such Advance will (A) be
within the Borrowers limited partnership powers, (B) have been duly authorized by all necessary
partnership action, (C) not contravene the Borrowers limited partnership agreement or other
organizational documents or contravene in any material respect any Legal Requirement, the Senior
Note Indenture or any other material contractual restriction of any material agreement binding on
or affecting the Borrower and (D) not result in or require the creation or imposition of any Lien
upon any of the material Property of any Credit Party prohibited by this Agreement.


Section 4.03 Authorization and Approvals. Other than those obtained or to be obtained
in the normal course of business in connection with the Credit Parties operations, (a) no consent,
order, authorization, or approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any
Governmental Authority or any other Person is required for the due execution, delivery, and
performance by any Credit Party of this Agreement, the Notes, or the other Loan Documents to which
such Credit Party is a party or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, and (b) at the time of each Borrowing and each issuance, increase or extension of a Letter
of Credit, no authorization or approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any
Governmental Authority will be required for such Borrowing or such issuance, increase or extension
of such Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds of such Borrowing or such Letter of Credit.


Section 4.04 Enforceable Obligations. This Agreement, the Notes, and the other Loan
Documents to which each Credit Party is a party have been duly executed and delivered by such
Credit Party. Each Loan Document to which each Credit Party is a party is the legal, valid, and
binding obligation of such Credit Party enforceable against such Credit Party in accordance with
its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, or similar law affecting creditors rights generally and by general
principles of equity.

 

49




 



Section 4.05 Financial Statements.


(a) The Borrower has delivered to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders the Financial
Statements, and the Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied
throughout the period covered thereby, except as otherwise expressly noted therein and present
fairly the consolidated financial condition of the Credit Parties as of their respective dates and
for their respective periods in accordance with GAAP, applied on a consistent basis (subject, in
the case of the quarterly Financial Statements, to year-end audit adjustments and the absence of
footnotes). The Financial Statements disclose, in accordance with GAAP, all material Debt, trade
payables, contingent obligations, liabilities for taxes, unusual forward or long-term commitments,
or unrealized or anticipated losses of any Credit Party that are required by GAAP to be disclosed
therein, and adequate reserves for such items have been made in accordance with GAAP.


(b) Since December 31, 2009, no Material Adverse Change has occurred and is continuing.


(c) Each of the Credit Parties is Solvent.


Section 4.06 True and Complete Disclosure. All written information (whether delivered
before or after the Closing Date) furnished by or on behalf of any Credit Party to any Lender or
the Administrative Agent for purposes of or in connection with this Agreement, any other Loan
Document or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby, when taken as a whole, is true and
accurate in all material respects on the date as of which such information is dated or certified
(or, if not dated and certified, as of the date as of which such information is provided) and does
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to
make the statements contained therein not materially misleading at such time. All projections,
estimates, and pro forma financial information furnished by the Borrower were prepared on the basis
of assumptions, data, information, tests, or conditions believed to be reasonable at the time such
projections, estimates, and pro forma financial information were furnished, but the Credit Parties
do not represent and warrant that such projections, estimates or pro forma information is (or will
ultimately prove to have been) accurate.


Section 4.07 Litigation. There is no pending or, to the knowledge of any Responsible
Officer of any Credit Party, threatened action or proceeding affecting any of the Credit Parties
before any court, Governmental Authority or arbitrator which (a) both (i) involves the possibility
of any judgment or liability against any Credit Party not fully covered by insurance (except for
normal deductibles) and (ii) could reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse Change or (b)
purports to affect the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of this Agreement, any
Note, or any other Loan Document. Additionally, there is no pending or, to the knowledge of any
Responsible Officer of any Credit Party, threatened action or proceeding instituted against any
Credit Party which seeks to adjudicate such Credit Party as bankrupt or insolvent, or seeking
liquidation, winding up, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, protection, relief, or
composition of it or its debts under any law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization
or relief of debtors, or seeking the entry of an order for relief or the appointment of a receiver,
trustee or other similar official for it or for any substantial part of its Property.

 

50




 



Section 4.08 Taxes.


(a) Reports and Payments. All material Returns (as defined below in clause (c) of
this Section) required to be filed by or on behalf of any Credit Party or any member of the
Controlled Group (hereafter collectively called the Tax Group) have been duly filed on a
timely basis or appropriate extensions have been obtained and such Returns are true, complete and
correct in all material respects; and all Taxes shown to be payable on the Returns or on subsequent
assessments with respect thereto have been or will be paid in full on a timely basis, and no other
material Taxes will be payable by the Tax Group with respect to items or periods covered by such
Returns, except where any obligation is being contested in good faith and by appropriate
proceedings and after adequate reserves for such items have been made in accordance with GAAP. The
reserves for accrued Taxes reflected in the financial statements delivered to the Lenders under
this Agreement are adequate in the aggregate for the payment of all unpaid Taxes, whether or not
disputed, for the period ended as of the date thereof and for any period prior thereto, and for
which the Tax Group may be liable.


(b) Taxes Definition. Taxes in this Section 4.08 shall mean all taxes,
charges, fees, levies, or other assessments imposed by any federal, state, local, or foreign taxing
authority, including without limitation, income, gross receipts, excise, real or personal property,
sales, occupation, use, service, leasing, environmental, value added, transfer, payroll, and
franchise taxes (and including any interest, penalties, or additions to tax attributable to or
imposed on with respect to any such assessment).


(c) Returns Definition. Returns in this Section 4.08 shall mean any
federal, state, local, or foreign report, estimate, declaration of estimated Tax, information
statement or return relating to, or required to be filed in connection with, any Taxes, including
any information return or report with respect to backup withholding or other payments of third
parties.


Section 4.09 Pension Plans. All Plans, if any, are in compliance in all material
respects with all applicable provisions of ERISA. No Termination Event has occurred with respect
to any Plan, and each Plan has complied with and been administered in all material respects in
accordance with applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code. No accumulated funding deficiency
(as defined in Section 302 of ERISA) has occurred and there has been no excise tax imposed under
Section 4971 of the Code. No Reportable Event has occurred with respect to any Multiemployer Plan,
if any, and each Multiemployer Plan has complied with and been administered in all material
respects with applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code. The present value of all benefits
vested under each Plan (based on the assumptions used to fund such Plan) did not, as of the last
annual valuation date applicable thereto, exceed the value of the assets of such Plan allocable to
such vested benefits. None of the Credit Parties or any member of the Controlled Group has had a
complete or partial withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan for which there is any withdrawal
liability. As of the most recent valuation date applicable thereto, none of the Credit Parties or
any member of the Controlled Group would become subject to any liability under ERISA if any Credit
Party or any member of the Controlled Group received notice that any Multiemployer Plan is
insolvent or in reorganization. Based upon GAAP existing as of the date of this Agreement and
current factual circumstances, no Credit Party has reason to believe that the annual cost during
the term of this Agreement to any Credit Party or any other member of the Controlled Group for
post-retirement benefits to be provided to the current and
former employees of the Borrower or any member of the Controlled Group under welfare benefit
plans (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) could, in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
cause a Material Adverse Change.

 

51




 



Section 4.10 Condition of Property; Casualties.


(a) Subject to the matters set forth in Schedule 4.10, each of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries has good and defensible title in all material respects to all of its Oil and Gas
Properties evaluated in the most recently delivered Engineering Report, free and clear of all Liens
except for Permitted Liens. Brigham Exploration has good and defensible title to all of the Equity
Interests in the General Partner, except for Permitted Liens. Brigham Exploration and the General
Partner have good and defensible title to all of the Equity Interests in the Borrower, except for
Permitted Liens.


(b) The quantum and nature of the interest of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries in and to its
Hydrocarbon Interests as set forth in the most recent Engineering Report are complete and accurate
in all material respects as of the date of such Engineering Report; and there are no back-in or
reversionary interests held by third parties which could materially reduce the interest of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries in such Hydrocarbon Interests except as taken into account in such
Engineering Report. The ownership of such Hydrocarbon Interests held by the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries shall not in any material respect obligate any of such Persons to bear the costs and
expenses relating to the maintenance, development, and operations of such Hydrocarbon Interests in
an amount in excess of the working interest of such Person in each such Hydrocarbon Interest set
forth in the most recent Engineering Report, except for obligations with respect to defaulting
parties under joint operating agreements and changes that arise under non-consent provisions of
operating agreements in connection with operations hereafter proposed.


(c) All leases, instruments and agreements comprising the Borrowers and its Subsidiaries Oil
and Gas Properties necessary for the conduct of business of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries are
valid and subsisting, in full force and effect and there exists no default or event of default or
circumstance which with the giving of notice or lapse of time or both would give rise to a default
under any such leases, instruments or agreements, in each case which would affect in any material
respect the conduct of the business of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries. Neither Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of Borrower, any other party to any leases, instruments
or agreements comprising its Oil and Gas Properties evaluated in the most recently delivered
Engineering Report, has given or threatened to give notice of any default under or inquiry into any
possible default under, or action to alter, terminate, rescind or procure a judicial reformation
of, any such lease, instrument or agreement.


(d) All of the Properties of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries that are reasonably necessary
for the operation of their business are in good repair, working order and condition in all material
respects and are maintained as is customary in the oil and gas industry. Since the date of the
most recent financial statements delivered pursuant to Section 5.06(a), neither the business nor
the Properties of the Credit Parties, taken as a whole, has been materially and adversely affected
as a result of any fire, explosion, earthquake, flood, drought, windstorm, accident, strike or
other labor disturbance, embargo, requisition or taking of Property or
cancellation of contracts, Permits, or concessions by a Governmental Authority, riot,
activities of armed forces, or acts of God or of any public enemy.

 

52




 



(e) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.10 or as otherwise disclosed in writing to the
Administrative Agent:


(i) In each case only with respect to any of the Borrowers and its Subsidiaries Oil and Gas
Properties that have been assigned a discounted present value equal to or in excess of $2,000,000
in any Engineering Report, (A) all rentals, royalties, overriding royalties, shut-in royalties and
other payments due under or with respect to any such Hydrocarbon Interests evaluated in any
Engineering Report have been properly and timely paid in the ordinary course of business and (B)
all material expenses payable under the terms of the contracts and agreements comprising such Oil
and Gas Properties (other than those described above in clause (A)) have been properly and timely
paid in the ordinary course of business, except in each case (1) where such payments are being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which adequate reserves complying with
GAAP have been made or (2) for payments the late payment of which could not reasonably be expected
to cause a termination or forfeiture of any of the Borrowers or its Subsidiaries rights under any
such leases, instruments or agreements comprising any such Oil and Gas Properties or otherwise,
individually or in the aggregate, cause a Material Adverse Change;


(ii) All of the proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons produced from the Borrowers and its
Subsidiaries Hydrocarbon Interests are being properly and timely paid to the Borrower without
suspense, other than any such proceeds the late payment or non-payment of which could not
reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse Change or materially adversely affect the value
of the Collateral taken as a whole; and


(iii) No material amount of proceeds that has been received by any Credit Party from the sale
of Hydrocarbons produced from the Oil and Gas Properties evaluated in the most recently delivered
Engineering Report is subject to any claim for any refund or refund obligation, except as permitted
under Section 4.14 or Section 6.13.


Section 4.11 Security Instruments.


(a) The provisions of each of the Pledge Agreements delivered to the Administrative Agent are
effective to create in favor of the Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Lenders, a
legal, valid and enforceable security interest in the Pledged Collateral (as defined therein) and
proceeds thereof and when (i) certificates, if any, representing or constituting the Pledged
Collateral are delivered to the Administrative Agent, the Pledge Agreement shall constitute a first
priority Acceptable Security Interest in, all right, title and interest of the pledgor party
thereto in such Pledged Collateral and the proceeds thereof, subject to Permitted Liens or and (ii)
upon the filing of UCC-1 Financing Statements with the secretary of state of each jurisdiction of
formation for each of the grantors party thereto, the Pledge Agreements shall constitute a first
priority Acceptable Security Interest in, all right, title and interest of the applicable Credit
Party in such Pledged Collateral and the proceeds thereof, subject to Permitted Liens.

 

53




 



(b) On the Closing Date, the Equity Interests listed on Schedule II to each of the
Pledge Agreements will constitute all the issued and outstanding Equity Interests owned by the
pledgors thereunder in the Borrower and the General Partner; all such Equity Interests have been
duly and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable; and the relevant pledgor of such
Equity Interests is the record and beneficial owner thereof.


(c) The provisions of the Mortgages will be effective to grant to the Administrative Agent,
for the ratable benefit of the Lenders, legal, valid and enforceable mortgage liens on all of the

by the Administrative Agent; provided, however that approximately 70% of such value
will be mortgaged by the Closing Date and the remainder will be mortgaged by April 30, 2011 (or
such later date, not to exceed 90 days after the Closing Date, as is reasonably acceptable to the

any new Material Subsidiary of Brigham Exploration or the Borrower, or (b) the purchase by Brigham
Exploration, the Borrower, or any of its other Subsidiaries of the Equity Interests of any Person,
which purchase results in such Person becoming a Material Subsidiary of Brigham Exploration or of
the Borrower permitted by this Agreement, Brigham Exploration or the Borrower, as applicable,
shall, in each case, cause (i) such Person to execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent a
joinder agreement to this Agreement in form and substance acceptable to the Administrative Agent, a
Pledge Agreement (if such new Subsidiary owns one or more Subsidiaries), one or more Mortgages (if
such new Subsidiary owns Oil and Gas Properties and if such Mortgages are otherwise required under
Section 5.11), and such other Security Instruments as the Administrative Agent or any Lender may
reasonably request (to the extent that such other Security Interests are required to be delivered
under the terms of this Agreement), in each case to secure the Obligations together with evidence
of corporate authority to enter into and such legal opinions in relation to such joinder agreement,
Pledge Agreement, Mortgages, and other Security Instruments as the Administrative Agent may
reasonably request, and (ii) the stockholder of such new Material Subsidiary to execute a Pledge

ARTICLE VIII



THE GUARANTY


Section 8.01 Liabilities Guaranteed. Each Guarantor hereby, joint and severally,
irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees the prompt payment at maturity of the Obligations.


Section 8.02 Nature of Guaranty. This guaranty is an absolute, irrevocable, completed
and continuing guaranty of payment and not a guaranty of collection, and no notice of the
Obligations or any extension of credit already or hereafter contracted by or extended to the
Borrower need be given to any Guarantor. This guaranty may not be revoked by any Guarantor and
shall continue to be effective with respect to the Obligations arising or created after any
attempted revocation by such Guarantor and shall remain in full force and effect until the
Obligations are paid in full and the Commitments are terminated, notwithstanding that from time to
time prior thereto no Obligations may be outstanding. The Borrower and the Lenders may modify,
alter, rearrange, extend for any period and/or renew from time to time, the Obligations, and the
Lenders may waive any Default or Events of Default without notice to any Guarantor and in such
event each Guarantor will remain fully bound hereunder on the Obligations. This guaranty shall
continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment of the
Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by any of the Lenders upon the insolvency,
bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been
made. This guaranty may be enforced by the Administrative Agent and any subsequent holder of any of
the Obligations and shall not be discharged by the assignment or negotiation of all or part of the
Obligations. Each Guarantor hereby expressly waives presentment, demand, notice of non-payment,
protest and notice of protest and dishonor, notice of Default or Event of Default, and also notice
of acceptance of this guaranty, acceptance
on the part of the Lenders being conclusively presumed by the Lenders request for this
guaranty and the Guarantors being party to this Agreement.

 

75




 



Section 8.03 Agents Rights. Each Guarantor authorizes the Administrative Agent,
without notice or demand and without affecting any Guarantors liability hereunder, to take and
hold security for the payment of its obligations under this Article VIII and/or the Obligations,
and exchange, enforce, waive and release any such security; and to apply such security and direct
the order or manner of sale thereof as the Administrative Agent in its discretion may determine,
and to obtain a guaranty of the Obligations from any one or more Persons and at any time or times
to enforce, waive, rearrange, modify, limit or release any of such other Persons from their
obligations under such guaranties.


Section 8.04 Guarantors Waivers.


(a) General. Each Guarantor waives any right to require any of the Lenders to (i)
proceed against the Borrower or any other person liable on the Obligations, (ii) enforce any of
their rights against any other guarantor of the Obligations, (iii) proceed or enforce any of their
rights against or exhaust any security given to secure the Obligations, (iv) have the Borrower
joined with any Guarantor in any suit arising out of this Article VIII and/or the Obligations, or
(v) pursue any other remedy in the Lenders powers whatsoever. The Lenders shall not be required to
mitigate damages or take any action to reduce, collect or enforce the Obligations. Guarantor waives
any defense arising by reason of any disability, lack of corporate authority or power, or other
defense of the Borrower or any other guarantor of the Obligations, and shall remain liable hereon
regardless of whether the Borrower or any other guarantor be found not liable thereon for any
reason. Whether and when to exercise any of the remedies of the Lenders under any of the Loan
Documents shall be in the sole and absolute discretion of the Administrative Agent, and no delay by
the Administrative Agent in enforcing any remedy, including delay in conducting a foreclosure sale,
shall be a defense to any Guarantors liability under this Article VIII.


(b) Subrogation. Until the Obligations have been paid in full, each Guarantor waives
all rights of subrogation or reimbursement against the Borrower, whether arising by contract or
operation of law (including, without limitation, any such right arising under any federal or state
bankruptcy or insolvency laws) and waives any right to enforce any remedy which the Lenders now
have or may hereafter have against the Borrower, and waives any benefit or any right to participate
in any security now or hereafter held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender.


Section 8.05 Maturity of Obligations, Payment. Each Guarantor agrees that if the
maturity of any of the Obligations is accelerated by bankruptcy or otherwise, such maturity shall
also be deemed accelerated for the purpose of this Article VIII without demand or notice to any
Guarantor. Each Guarantor will, forthwith upon notice from the Administrative Agent, jointly and
severally pay to the Administrative Agent the amount due and unpaid by the Borrower and guaranteed
hereby. The failure of the Administrative Agent to give this notice shall not in any way release
any Guarantor hereunder.


Section 8.06 Agents Expenses. If any Guarantor fails to pay the Obligations after
notice from the Administrative Agent of the Borrowers failure to pay any Obligations at
maturity, and if the Administrative Agent obtains the services of an attorney for collection
of amounts owing by any Guarantor hereunder, or obtains advice of counsel in respect of any of
their rights under this Article VIII, or if suit is filed to enforce this Article VIII, or if
proceedings are had in any bankruptcy, probate, receivership or other judicial proceedings for the
establishment or collection of any amount owing by any Guarantor hereunder, or if any amount owing
by any Guarantor hereunder is collected through such proceedings, each Guarantor jointly and
severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent the Administrative Agents reasonable
attorneys fees.

 

76




 



Section 8.07 Liability. It is expressly agreed that, as between each Guarantor and
the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, the liability of each Guarantor for the payment of the
Obligations guaranteed hereby shall be primary and not secondary.


Section 8.08 Events and Circumstances Not Reducing or Discharging any Guarantors
Obligations. Each Guarantor hereby consents and agrees to each of the following to the fullest
extent permitted by law, and agrees that each Guarantors obligations under this Article VIII shall
not be released, diminished, impaired, reduced or adversely affected by any of the following, and
waives any rights (including without limitation rights to notice) which each Guarantor might
otherwise have as a result of or in connection with any of the following:


(a) Modifications, etc. Any renewal, extension, modification, increase, decrease,
alteration or rearrangement of all or any part of the Obligations, or of the Notes, or this
Agreement or any instrument executed in connection therewith, or any contract or understanding

transfer of any or all of the assets of the Borrower or any Guarantor, or any changes in the
shareholders, partners, or members of the Borrower or any Guarantor; or any reorganization of the
Borrower or any Guarantor;


(d) Invalidity of Obligations. The invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of all
or any part of the Obligations, or any document or agreement executed in connection with the
Obligations, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation the fact that the Obligations,
or any part thereof, exceed the amount permitted by law, the act of creating the Obligations or any
part thereof is ultra vires, the officers or representatives executing the documents or otherwise
creating the Obligations acted in excess of their authority, the Obligations violate applicable
usury laws, the Borrower has valid defenses, claims or offsets (whether at law, in equity or by
agreement) which render the Obligations wholly or partially uncollectible from the Borrower, the
creation, performance or repayment of the Obligations (or the execution, delivery and performance
of any document or instrument representing part of the
Obligations or executed in connection with the Obligations, or given to secure the repayment
of the Obligations) is illegal, uncollectible, legally impossible or unenforceable, or this
Agreement or other documents or instruments pertaining to the Obligations have been forged or
otherwise are irregular or not genuine or authentic;

 

77




 



(e) Release of Obligors. Any full or partial release of the liability of the Borrower
on the Obligations or any part thereof, of any co-guarantors, or any other Person now or hereafter
liable, whether directly or indirectly, jointly, severally, or jointly and severally, to pay,
perform, guarantee or assure the payment of the Obligations or any part thereof, it being
recognized, acknowledged and agreed by any Guarantor that such Guarantor may be required to pay the
Obligations in full without assistance or support of any other Person, and no Guarantor has been
induced to enter into this Article VIII on the basis of a contemplation, belief, understanding or
agreement that other parties other than the Borrower will be liable to perform the Obligations, or
the Lenders will look to other parties to perform the Obligations;


(f) Other Security. The taking or accepting of any other security, collateral or
guaranty, or other assurance of payment, for all or any part of the Obligations;


(g) Release of Collateral etc. Any release, surrender, exchange, subordination,

Obligations;


(h) Care and Diligence. The failure of the Lenders or any other Person to exercise
diligence or reasonable care in the preservation, protection, enforcement, sale or other handling
or treatment of all or any part of such collateral, property or security;


(i) Status of Liens. The fact that any collateral, security, security interest or lien
contemplated or intended to be given, created or granted as security for the repayment of the
Obligations shall not be properly perfected or created, or shall prove to be unenforceable or
subordinate to any other security interest or lien, it being recognized and agreed by each
Guarantor that no Guarantor is entering into this Article VIII in reliance on, or in contemplation
of the benefits of, the validity, enforceability, collectibility or value of any of the collateral
for the Obligations;


(j) Payments Rescinded. Any payment by the Borrower to the Lenders is held to
constitute a preference under the bankruptcy laws, or for any reason the Lenders are required to
refund such payment or pay such amount to the Borrower or someone else; or


(k) Other Actions Taken or Omitted. Any other action taken or omitted to be taken
with respect to this Agreement, the Obligations, or the security and collateral therefor, whether
or not such action or omission prejudices any Guarantor or increases the likelihood that any
Guarantor will be required to pay the Obligations pursuant to the terms hereof, it being the
unambiguous and unequivocal intention of each Guarantor that each Guarantor shall be obligated to
joint and severally pay the Obligations when due, notwithstanding any occurrence, circumstance,
event, action, or omission whatsoever, whether contemplated or uncontemplated,
and whether or not otherwise or particularly described herein, except for the full and final
payment and satisfaction of the Obligations.

 

78




 



Section 8.09 Subordination of All Guarantor Claims. As used herein, the term
Guarantor Claims shall mean all debts and liabilities of the Borrower or any Subsidiary of the
Borrower to any Guarantor, whether such debts and liabilities now exist or are hereafter incurred
or arise, or whether the obligation of the Borrower or such Subsidiary thereon be direct,
contingent, primary, secondary, several, joint and several, or otherwise, and irrespective of
whether such debts or liabilities be evidenced by note, contract, open account, or otherwise, and
irrespective of the person or persons in whose favor such debts or liabilities may, at their
inception, have been, or may hereafter be created, or the manner in which they have been or may
hereafter be acquired by any Guarantor. The Guarantor Claims shall include without limitation all
rights and claims of any Guarantor against the Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower arising
as a result of subrogation or otherwise as a result of such Guarantors payment of all or a portion
of the Obligations. Until the Obligations shall be paid and satisfied in full and each Guarantor
shall have performed all of its obligations hereunder, no Guarantor shall receive or collect,
directly or indirectly, from the Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower or any other party any
amount upon the Guarantor Claims during the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default.


Section 8.10 Claims in Bankruptcy. In the event of receivership, bankruptcy,
reorganization, arrangement, debtors relief, or other insolvency proceedings involving the
Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower, as debtor, the Lenders shall have the right to prove
their claim in any proceeding, so as to establish their rights hereunder and receive directly from
the receiver, trustee or other court custodian, dividends and payments which would otherwise be
payable upon Guarantor Claims. Each Guarantor hereby assigns such dividends and payments to the
Lenders. Should the Administrative Agent or any Lender receive, for application upon the
Obligations, any such dividend or payment which is otherwise payable to any Guarantor, and which,
as between the Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower and any Guarantor, shall constitute a
credit upon the Guarantor Claims, then upon payment in full of the Obligations, such Guarantor
shall become subrogated to the rights of the Lenders to the extent that such payments to the
Lenders on the Guarantor Claims have contributed toward the liquidation of the Obligations, and
such subrogation shall be with respect to that proportion of the Obligations which would have been
unpaid if the Administrative Agent or a Lender had not received dividends or payments upon the
Guarantor Claims.


Section 8.11 Payments Held in Trust. In the event that notwithstanding Sections 8.09
and 8.10 above, any Guarantor should receive any funds, payments, claims or distributions which is
prohibited by such Sections, such Guarantor agrees to hold in trust for the Lenders an amount equal
to the amount of all funds, payments, claims or distributions so received, and agrees that it shall
have absolutely no dominion over the amount of such funds, payments, claims or distributions except
to pay them promptly to the Administrative Agent, and each Guarantor covenants promptly to pay the
same to the Administrative Agent.


Section 8.12 Liens Subordinate. Each Guarantor agrees that any liens, security
interests, judgment liens, charges or other encumbrances upon the Borrowers or any Subsidiary of
the Borrowers assets securing payment of the Guarantor Claims shall be and remain inferior
and subordinate to any liens, security interests, judgment liens, charges or other
encumbrances upon the Borrowers or any Subsidiary of the Borrowers assets securing payment of the
Obligations, regardless of whether such encumbrances in favor of any Guarantor, the Administrative
Agent or the Lenders presently exist or are hereafter created or attach.

 

79




 



Section 8.13 Guarantors Enforcement Rights. Without the prior written consent of the
Lenders, no Guarantor shall (a) exercise or enforce any creditors right it may have against the
Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower, or (b) foreclose, repossess, sequester or otherwise
take steps or institute any action or proceeding (judicial or otherwise, including without
limitation the commencement of or joinder in any liquidation, bankruptcy, rearrangement, debtors
relief or insolvency proceeding) to enforce any lien, mortgages, deeds of trust, security interest,
collateral rights, judgments or other encumbrances on assets of the Borrower or any Subsidiary of
the Borrower held by Guarantor.


ARTICLE IX



THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT


Section 9.01 Appointment and Authority. Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Lender
hereby irrevocably appoints Bank of America to act on its behalf as the Administrative Agent
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such
actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by
the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental
thereto. The provisions of this Article (other than Sections 9.06 and 9.10) are solely for the
benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Lender, and neither the Borrower
nor any other Credit Party shall have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such
provisions.


Section 9.02 Rights as a Lender. The Person serving as the Administrative Agent
hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and
may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent and the term Lender or
Lenders shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires,
include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such
Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as the financial advisor or
in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower
or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent
hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.


Section 9.03 Exculpatory Provisions. The Administrative Agent shall not have any
duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent:


(a) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a
Default has occurred and is continuing;


(b) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary
powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or
by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed
in writing by the Majority Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be
expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents), provided that the
Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion
of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan
Document or applicable law; and

 

80




 



(c) shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any
duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to
the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as
the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.


The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with
the consent or at the request of the Majority Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the
Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be
necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Sections 10.01, 7.02 and 7.03) or (ii) in the
absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be
deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice describing such Default is
given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower, a Lender or the Issuing Lender.


The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire
into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or
any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered
hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance
of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the
occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this
Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the
satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article III or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm
receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.


Section 9.04 Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be
entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request,
certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic
message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine
and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative
Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have
been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In
determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance of a
Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or the
Issuing Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such
Lender or the Issuing Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the
contrary from such Lender or the Issuing Lender prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of
such Letter of Credit. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel
for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be
liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel,
accountants or experts.

 

81




 



Section 9.05 Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may perform any and all
of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or
through any one or more sub agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent
and any such sub agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by
or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall
apply to any such sub agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub
agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the
credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.


Section 9.06 Resignation of Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may at any
time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders, the Issuing Lender and the Borrower. Upon
receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Majority Lenders shall have the right, in
consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the
United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States. If no such
successor shall have been so appointed by the Majority Lenders and shall have accepted such
appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation,
then the retiring Administrative Agent may on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Lender, appoint
a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above; provided that
if the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that no qualifying Person has
accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance
with such notice and (1) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any collateral
security held by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders or the Issuing Lender under any
of the Loan Documents, the retiring Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral
security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and (2) all payments,
communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent
shall instead be made by or to each Lender and the Issuing Lender directly, until such time as the
Majority Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above in this Section.
Upon the acceptance of a successors appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor
shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the
retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be
discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if
not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section). The fees payable by the
Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor
unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the retiring Administrative
Agents resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article
and Section 10.04 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent,
its sub agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to
be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent.

 

82




 



Any resignation by Bank of America as Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section shall also
constitute its resignation as Issuing Lender. Upon the acceptance of a successors appointment as
Administrative Agent hereunder, (a) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of
the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Issuing Lender, (b) the
retiring Issuing Lender shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder
or under the other Loan Documents, and (c) the successor Issuing Lender shall issue letters of
credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such
succession or make other arrangement satisfactory to the retiring Issuing Lender to effectively
assume the obligations of the retiring Issuing Lender with respect to such Letters of Credit.


Section 9.07 Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders. Each Lender and
the Issuing Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision
to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender and the Issuing Lender also acknowledges that it will,
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of
their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time
deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based
upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished
hereunder or thereunder.


Section 9.08 No Other Duties, Etc. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding,
none of the Book Manager, Lead Arranger, Co-Syndication Agents or Co-Documentation Agents shall
have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents, except in their capacity, as applicable, as the Administrative Agent, a Lender or the
Issuing Lender hereunder.


Section 9.09 Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim. In case of the pendency
of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment,
composition or other judicial proceeding relative to any Credit Party, the Administrative Agent
(irrespective of whether the principal of any Advance or Letter of Credit Exposure shall then be
due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the
Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered,
by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise


(a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and
unpaid in respect of the Advances, Letter of Credit Exposure and all other Obligations that are
owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have
the claims of the Lenders, the Issuing Lender and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for
the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders, the Issuing
Lender and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts
due the Lenders, the Issuing Lender and the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.08 and 10.04)
allowed in such judicial proceeding; and


(b) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such
claims and to distribute the same;


and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official
in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender and the Issuing Lender to make
such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall
consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders and the Issuing Lender, to
pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other
amounts due the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.09 and 10.04.


 

83




 






Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or
consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender or the Issuing Lender any plan of
reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of
any Lender or to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender
in any such proceeding.


Section 9.10 Collateral and Guaranty Matters. The Lenders and the Issuing Lender
irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent, at its option and in its discretion,


(a) to release any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under

of all Letters of Credit, (ii) that is sold or transferred or to be sold or transferred as part of
or in connection with any sale or transfer permitted hereunder or under any other Loan Document,

the Issuing Lender or any other Person for losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses of any
kind (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) arising out of the Borrowers or the Administrative
Agents transmission of Borrower Materials through the Internet, except to the extent that such
losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses are determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction by a final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of such Agent Party; provided, however, that in no event shall
any Agent Party have any liability to the Borrower, any Lender, the Issuing Lender or any other
Person for indirect, special, incidental, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct

Agent, the Issuing Lender and the Lenders shall be entitled to rely and act upon
any notices (including telephonic Notices of Borrowing) purportedly given by or on behalf of
the Borrower even if (i) such notices were not made in a manner specified herein, were incomplete
or were not preceded or followed by any other form of notice specified herein, or (ii) the terms
thereof, as understood by the recipient, varied from any confirmation thereof. The Borrower shall

Section 10.03 No Waiver; Remedies. No failure on the part of any Lender, the
Administrative Agent, or the Issuing Lender to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right
hereunder or under any Note shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any such right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies
provided by law.


Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, the
authority to enforce rights and remedies hereunder and under the other Loan Documents against the
Credit Parties or any of them shall be vested exclusively in, and all actions and proceedings at
law in connection with such enforcement shall be instituted and maintained exclusively by, the
Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 7.02 for the benefit of all the Lenders and the
Issuing Lender; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prohibit (a) the
Administrative Agent from exercising on its own behalf the rights and remedies that inure to its

Documents, (b) the Issuing Lender from exercising the rights and remedies that inure to its benefit
(solely in its capacity as Issuing Lender) hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, (c) any

Section 2.11), or (d) any Lender from filing proofs of claim or appearing and filing pleadings on
its own behalf during the pendency of a proceeding relative to any Credit Party under any
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or similar law affecting creditors
rights generally and by general principles of equity; and provided, further, that
if at any time there is no Person acting as Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents, then (i) the Majority Lenders shall have the rights otherwise ascribed to the
Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 7.02 and (ii) in addition to the matters set forth in
clauses (b), (c) and (d) of the preceding proviso and subject to Section 2.11, any Lender may, with
the consent of the Majority Lenders, enforce any rights and remedies available to it and as
authorized by the Majority Lenders.

against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities
and related expenses (including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any
Indemnitee), and shall indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnitee from all fees and time charges
and disbursements for attorneys who may be employees of any Indemnitee, incurred by any Indemnitee
or asserted against any Indemnitee by any third party or by the Borrower or any other Credit Party
arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this
Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby,
the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or thereunder or

presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of
Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any
property owned or operated by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental
Liability related in any way to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or
prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing,
whether based on contract, tort or any other theory, whether brought by a third party or by the
Borrower or any other Credit Party, and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto, IN
ALL CASES, WHETHER OR NOT CAUSED BY OR ARISING, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, OUT OF THE NEGLIGENCE OF THE
INDEMNITEE; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to
the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses (x) are determined by
a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or (y) result from a claim brought by the
Borrower or any other Credit Party against an Indemnitee for breach in bad faith of such
Indemnitees obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document, if the Borrower or such Credit
Party has obtained a final and nonappealable judgment in its favor on such claim as determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction.

 

89




 



(c) Reimbursement by Lenders. To the extent that the Borrower for any reason fails to
indefeasibly pay any amount required under subsection (a) or (b) of this Section to be paid by

or any Related Party of any of the foregoing, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Lead
Arranger, Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), the Issuing Lender or such Related Party,

unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount, provided that
the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the
case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent)
or the Issuing Lender in its capacity as such, or against any Related Party of any of the foregoing
acting for the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) or Issuing Lender in connection with
such capacity. The obligations of the Lenders under this subsection (c) are subject to the
provisions of Section 2.03(f).


(d) Waiver of Consequential Damages, Etc. To the fullest extent permitted by

as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated
hereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Advance or Letter of Credit or the use
of the proceeds thereof. No Indemnitee referred to in subsection (b) above shall be liable for any
damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials
distributed to such unintended recipients by such Indemnitee through telecommunications, electronic
or other information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby other than for direct or actual
damages resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee as determined
by a final and nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.

contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender
and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this
Agreement.


(b) Assignments by Lenders. Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible
Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a

participations in Letter of Credit Exposure) at the time owing to it); provided that any
such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions:


(i) Minimum Amounts.



(A) in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the
assigning Lenders Commitment and the Advances at the time owing to it or in the
case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, no
minimum amount need be assigned; and



(B) in any case not described in subsection (b)(i)(A) of this Section, the
aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Advances
outstanding thereunder) or, if the Commitment is not then in effect, the principal
outstanding balance of the Advances of the assigning Lender subject to each such
assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to
such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if Trade Date is
specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not be less
than $5,000,000 unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise consents (each such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed);


(ii) Proportionate Amounts. Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of
a proportionate part of all the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement with
respect to the Advances or the Commitment assigned;

 

91




 



(iii) Required Consents. No consent shall be required for any assignment except to
the extent required by subsection (b)(i)(B) of this Section and, in addition:



(A) the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld)
shall be required unless (1) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at
the time of such assignment or (2) such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a
Lender or an Approved Fund; provided that the Borrower shall be
deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by
written notice to the Administrative Agent within seven (7) Business Days after
having received notice thereof;



(B) the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required if such assignment is to a
Person that is not a Lender, an Affiliate of such Lender or an Approved Fund with
respect to such Lender; and



(C) the consent of the Issuing Lender (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) shall be required for any assignment that increases the
obligation of the assignee to participate in exposure under one or more Letters of
Credit (whether or not then outstanding).


(iv) Assignment and Assumption. The parties to each assignment shall execute and
deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and
recordation fee of $3,500; provided that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole
discretion, elect to waive such processing and recordation fee in the case of any assignment. The
Eligible Assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an
Administrative Questionnaire.


(v) No Assignment to Certain Persons. No such assignment shall be made (A) to the
Borrower or any of the Borrowers Affiliates or Subsidiaries, or (B) to any Defaulting Lender or
any of its Subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute any
of the foregoing Persons described in this clause (B), or (C) to a natural person.


(vi) Certain Additional Payments. In connection with any assignment of rights and
obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and
until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment
shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient,
upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee
of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the
consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans
previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable
assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment
liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder
(and interest accrued thereon) and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of
all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit in accordance with its Pro Rata Share.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any
Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable law without
compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be
deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.

 

92




 



Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (c)
of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the
Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest
assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this
Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by
such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the
case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lenders rights and obligations
under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be
entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.13, 2.14, and 10.04 with respect to facts and circumstances
occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment. Upon request, the Borrower (at its
expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a
Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection
shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such
rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section.



(c) Register. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of
the Borrower (and such agency being solely for tax purposes), shall maintain at the Administrative
Agents Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal
amounts of the Advances and Letter of Credit Exposure owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms
hereof from time to time (the Register). The entries in the Register shall be
conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose
name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all
purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. In addition, the
Administrative Agent shall maintain on the Register information regarding the designation, and
revocation of designation, or any Lender as a Defaulting Lender. The Register shall be available
for inspection by each of the Borrower and any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time
upon reasonable prior notice. In addition, at any time that a request for a consent for a material
or substantive change to the Loan Documents is pending, any Lender wishing to consult with other
Lenders in connection therewith may request and receive from the Administrative Agent a copy of the
Register.


(d) Participations. Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to,
the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural
person, a Defaulting Lender or the Borrower or any of the Borrowers Affiliates or Subsidiaries)
(each, a Participant) in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and/or obligations under this
Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Advances (including such
Lenders participations in Letter of Credit Exposure owing to it); provided that (i) such
Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain
solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii)
the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Lender shall continue to deal
solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations
under this Agreement.

 

93




 



Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall
provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any
amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such
agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the
Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in clauses (b), (c),
(d), (j) or (k) of the first proviso to Section 10.01 that affects such Participant. Subject to
subsection (e) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the
benefits of Sections 2.13 and 2.14 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its
interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law,
each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 7.04 as though it were a Lender,
provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.11 as though it were a Lender.


(e) Limitations upon Participant Rights. A Participant shall not be entitled to
receive any greater payment under Section 2.13 or 2.14 than the applicable Lender would have been
entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of
the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrowers prior written consent. A
Participant that is not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or a state
thereof shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.14 unless the Borrower is notified of
the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the
Borrower, to comply with Section 2.14 as though it were a Lender.


(f) Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest
in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to
secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a
Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender
from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as
a party hereto.


(g) Electronic Execution of Assignments. The words execution, signed,
signature, and words of like import in any Assignment and Assumption shall be deemed to include
electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the
same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a
paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any
applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act,
the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on
the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.

(h) Special Purpose Funding Vehicles. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, any Lender (a Granting Lender) may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle
identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent
and the Borrower (an SPC) the option to provide all or any part of any Advance that such Granting
Lender would otherwise be obligated to make pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (i)
nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to fund any Advance, and (ii) if an SPC
elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to make all
or any part of such Advance, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Advance
pursuant to the terms hereof or, if it fails to do so, to make such payment to the Administrative
Agent as is required under Section 2.10. Each party hereto hereby agrees that (i) neither the
grant to any SPC nor the exercise by any SPC of such option shall increase the costs or expenses or
otherwise increase or change the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement (including its
obligations under Sections 2.13 and 2.14), (ii) no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar
payment obligation under this Agreement for which a Lender would be liable, and (iii) the Granting
Lender shall for all purposes, including the approval of any amendment, waiver or other
modification of any provision of any Loan Document, remain the lender of record hereunder. The
making of an Advance by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the
same extent, and as if, such Advance were made by such Granting Lender. In furtherance of the
foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this
Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all
outstanding commercial paper or other senior debt of any SPC, it will not institute against, or
join any other Person in instituting against, such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement,
insolvency, or liquidation proceeding under the laws of the United States or any State thereof.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any SPC may (i) with notice to, but
without prior consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and with the payment of a
processing fee of $3500, assign all or any portion of its right to receive payment with respect to
any Advance to the Granting Lender and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public
information relating to its funding of Advances to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or
provider of any surety or Guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC.


(i) Resignation as Issuing Lender after Assignment. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, if at any time Bank of America assigns all of its Commitment and
Advances pursuant to subsection (b) above, Bank of America may, upon 30 days notice to the
Borrower and the Lenders, resign as Issuing Lender. In the event of any such resignation as
Issuing Lender, the Borrower shall be entitled to appoint from among the Lenders a successor
Issuing Lender hereunder and such appointment shall be effective upon the acceptance by such
successor of its appointment as Issuing Lender hereunder; provided, however, that
no failure by the Borrower to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of Bank of
America as Issuing Lender. If Bank of America resigns as Issuing Lender, it shall retain all the
rights, powers, privileges and duties of the Issuing Lender hereunder with respect to all Letters
of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as Issuing Lender and all Letter
of Credit Exposure with respect thereto (including the right to require the Lenders to make Base
Rate Advances or fund risk participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to Section 2.07(c)).


Section 10.07 Treatment of Certain Information; Confidentiality. Each of the
Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Lender agrees to maintain the confidentiality of
the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates
and to its and its Affiliates respective partners, directors, officers, employees, agents,
trustees, advisors and representatives (it being understood that the Persons to whom such
disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed
to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority
purporting to have jurisdiction over it (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the
National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) to the

 

95




 



extent
required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party hereto, (e)
in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any
action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of
rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the
same as those of this Section, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective
assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any
actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating
to the Borrower and its obligations, (g) with the consent of the Borrower or (h) to the extent such
Information (x) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or
(y) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender, the Issuing Lender or any of their
respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower, any
Subsidiary or any Credit Party.



For purposes of this Section, Information means all information received from Brigham
Exploration or any of its Subsidiaries relating to any of them or any of their respective
businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent, any
Lender or the Issuing Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by Brigham Exploration
or any of its Subsidiaries, provided that, in the case of information received from Brigham
Exploration or any of its Subsidiaries after the date hereof, such information is clearly
identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the
confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied
with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the
confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential
information.


Each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Lender acknowledges that (a) the
Information may include material non-public information concerning Brigham Exploration or any of
its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, (b) it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use
of material non-public information and (c) it will handle such material non-public information in
accordance with applicable Law, including United States Federal and state securities Laws.


Section 10.08 Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so
executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and
the same agreement.


Section 10.09 Survival of Representations and Warranties. All representations and
warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document delivered pursuant
hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery
hereof and thereof. Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the
Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by the Administrative
Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any
Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default at the time of any Borrowing or a L/C
Extension, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any Advance or any other
Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied or any Letter of Credit shall remain
outstanding. All obligations of the Borrower and of the Lenders provided
for in Sections 2.12, 2.13, 2.14(c), 10.04 and 10.07 shall survive any termination of this
Agreement and repayment in full of the Obligations.

 

96




 



Section 10.10 Severability. In case one or more provisions of this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable
law, the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein or
therein shall not be affected or impaired thereby.


Section 10.11 Payments Set Aside. To the extent that any payment by or on behalf of
the Borrower is made to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or any Lender, or the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or any Lender exercises its right of setoff, and such
payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to
be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered
into by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid
to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or similar law affecting creditors rights
generally and by general principles of equity or otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such
recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and
continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not
occurred, and (b) each Lender and the Issuing Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative
Agent upon demand its applicable share (without duplication) of any amount so recovered from or
repaid by the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date
such payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in
effect. The obligations of the Lenders and the Issuing Lender under clause (b) of the preceding
sentence shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this
Agreement.


Section 10.12 Governing Law. Except as otherwise expressly stated in any Security
Instrument, this Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan Documents shall be governed by, and
construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. Each Letter of
Credit shall be governed by (a) the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (2007
Revision), International Chamber of Commerce Publication No. 600 (or any successor to such
publication) if it is a commercial letter of credit or (b) the ISP if it is a standby letter of
credit.


Section 10.13 Submission To Jurisdiction; Waivers. Each party to this Agreement
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally:


(A) submits itself and its Property in any legal action or proceeding relating to
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, or for recognition and
enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof, to the non-exclusive general jurisdiction of the
Courts of the State of New York for the Borough of Manhattan, the courts of the United States of
America for the Southern District of New York, and appellate courts from any thereof; 

 

97




 



(b) consents that any such action or proceeding may be brought in such courts and
waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue 
of any such action or proceeding in any such court or that such action or proceeding was
brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same;


(c) agrees that service of process in any such action or proceeding may be
effected by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified mail (or any substantially similar
form of mail), postage prepaid, to it at its address set forth in schedule 10.02 or at such
other address of which the Administrative Agent shall have been notified pursuant hereto; and


(d) agrees that nothing herein shall affect the right to effect service of
process in any other manner permitted by law or shall limit the right to sue in any other
jurisdiction.


Section 10.14 Waiver of Jury Trial. Each party hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in any
legal proceeding directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other
Loan Document or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (whether based on contract, tort
or any other theory). Each party hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of
any other person has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other person would not, in the
event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the
other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this section.


Section 10.15 Oral Agreements. This Agreement and the Loan Documents represent the
final agreement among the parties and may not be contradicted by evidence of prior,
contemporaneous, or subsequent oral agreements of the parties. There are no unwritten oral
agreements among the parties hereto.


Section 10.16 Production Proceeds. Notwithstanding that, by the terms of the various
Security Instruments, the Credit Parties are and will be assigning to the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders all of the Production Proceeds (as defined therein) and other proceeds accruing to
the Property covered thereby, so long as no Event of Default has occurred the Credit Parties may
continue to receive from the purchasers of production all such Production Proceeds and other
proceeds, subject, however, to the Liens created under the Security Instruments, which Liens are
hereby affirmed and ratified. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent
may exercise all rights and remedies granted under the Security Instruments, including the right to
obtain possession of all Production Proceeds and other proceeds then held by the Credit Parties or
to receive directly from the purchasers of production all other Production Proceeds and other
proceeds. In no case shall any failure, whether intentional or inadvertent, by the Administrative
Agent to collect directly any such Production Proceeds constitute in any way a waiver, remission or
release of any of its or the Lenders rights under the Security Instruments, nor shall any release
of any Production Proceeds or other proceeds by the Administrative Agent to the Credit Parties
constitute a waiver, remission, or release of any other Production Proceeds or other proceeds or of
any rights of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders to collect other Production Proceeds or other
proceeds thereafter.

Section 10.17 Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender (a) requests compensation under
Section 2.13, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.14, (b) is a Defaulting
Lender, or (c) fails to consent to an election, consent, amendment, waiver or other modification to
this Agreement or any other Loan Document that requires the consent of a greater percentage of the
Lenders than the Majority Lenders and such election, consent, amendment, waiver or other
modification is otherwise consented to by the Majority Lenders, then the Borrower may, at its sole
expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to
assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained
in, and consents required by, Section 10.06), all of its interests, rights and obligations under
this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations
(which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), provided that:


(i) the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in
Section 10.06;


(ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to 100% of the outstanding
principal of its Loans and L/C Advances, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other
amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents from the assignee (to the extent
of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all
other amounts);


(iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section
2.13 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.14, such assignment will result in a
reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; and


(iv) such assignment does not conflict with applicable Legal Requirements.


A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as
a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to
require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.


Section 10.18 Amendment and Restatement. The Borrower, the Agents and the Lenders
have agreed that this Agreement is an amendment and restatement of the Existing Senior Credit
Agreement in its entirety and the terms and provisions hereof supersede the terms and provisions
thereof, and this Agreement is not a new or substitute credit agreement or novation of the Existing
Senior Credit Agreement.

 

99




 



Section 10.19 No Advisory or Fiduciary Responsibility. In connection with all aspects
of each transaction contemplated hereby (including in connection with any amendment, waiver or
other modification hereof or of any other Loan Document), the Borrower and each other Credit Party
acknowledges and agrees, and acknowledges its Affiliates understanding, that: (i) (A) the
arranging and other services regarding this Agreement provided by the Administrative Agent and the
Lead Arranger, are arms-length commercial transactions between the Borrower, each other Credit
Party and their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent and the Lead
Arranger on the other hand, (B) each of the Borrower and the other Credit Parties has consulted its
own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it has
deemed appropriate, and (C) the Borrower and each other Credit Party is capable of evaluating,
and understands and accepts, the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated
hereby and by the other Loan Documents; (ii) (A) the Administrative Agent and the Lead Arranger
each is and has been acting solely as a principal and, except as expressly agreed in writing by the
relevant parties, has not been, is not, and will not be acting as an advisor, agent or fiduciary
for the Borrower, any other Credit Party or any of their respective Affiliates, or any other Person
and (B) neither the Administrative Agent nor the Lead Arranger has any obligation to the Borrower,
any other Credit Party or any of their respective Affiliates with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby except those obligations expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan
Documents; and (iii) the Administrative Agent and the Lead Arranger and their respective Affiliates
may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of
the Borrower, the other Credit Parties and their respective Affiliates, and neither the
Administrative Agent nor the Lead Arranger has any obligation to disclose any of such interests to
the Borrower, any other Credit Party or any of their respective Affiliates. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, each of the Borrower and the other Credit Parties hereby waives and releases any
claims that it may have against the Administrative Agent and the Lead Arranger with respect to any
breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty in connection with any aspect of any
transaction contemplated hereby.


Section 10.20 USA PATRIOT Act Notice. Each Lender that is subject to the Act (as
hereinafter defined) and the Administrative Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Lender)
hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of
Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the Act), it is required to obtain, verify
and record information that identifies the Borrower, which information includes the name and
address of the Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender or the Administrative
Agent, as applicable, to identify the Borrower in accordance with the Act.


Section 10.21 Termination. In the event that the Commitments have been reduced to
zero, no Letters of Credit are outstanding and all Advances and other Obligations have been fully
and finally paid, this Agreement shall terminate (except for provisions expressly stated to survive
any such termination), and the Agent and the Lenders shall, upon the request and at the cost and
expense of the Borrower, cause to be executed and delivered such releases of Collateral,
assignments or other documents or instruments to evidence such termination as the Borrower shall
reasonably request.
