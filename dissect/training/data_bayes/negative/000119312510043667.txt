judgment of the Initial Purchasers or counsel for the Initial Purchasers it is otherwise necessary to amend or supplement the Final Offering Memorandum to comply with law, the Company agrees to promptly prepare (subject to Section 3 hereof) and

solicitation or general advertising (within the meaning of Rule 502 under the Securities Act) will be used in the United States in connection with the offering of the Securities.

of any Security.  SECTION 8. Indemnification.  (a) Indemnification of the Initial Purchasers. The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Initial Purchaser, its
directors, officers and employees, and each person, if any, who controls any Initial Purchaser within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense, as incurred, to which such Initial
Purchaser, director, officer, employee or controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, or at common law or otherwise (including in settlement of any
litigation, if such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company), insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense (or actions in respect thereof as contemplated below) arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement
or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Pricing Disclosure Package, any Company Additional Written Information or the Final Offering Memorandum (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission
therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and to reimburse each Initial Purchaser and
  
 19 






 
each such director, officer, employee or controlling person for any and all expenses (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.) as such expenses are
reasonably incurred by such Initial Purchaser or such director, officer, employee or controlling person in connection with investigating, defending, settling, compromising or paying any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action;
provided, however, that the foregoing indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense to the extent, but only to the extent, arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or
omission or alleged omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Initial Purchasers expressly for use in the Pricing Disclosure Package, any Company Additional Written Information or the
Final Offering Memorandum (or any amendment or supplement thereto). The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 8(a) shall be in addition to any liabilities that the Company may otherwise have.  (b) Indemnification of the Company. Each Initial Purchaser agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, its directors and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense, as incurred, to which the Company or any such director or
controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, or at common law or otherwise (including in settlement of any litigation, if such settlement is effected with
the written consent of such Initial Purchaser), insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense (or actions in respect thereof as contemplated below) arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact contained in the Pricing Disclosure Package, any Company Additional Written Information or the Final Offering Memorandum (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission
or alleged omission was made in the Pricing Disclosure Package, any Company Additional Written Information or the Final Offering Memorandum (or any amendment or supplement thereto), in reliance upon and in conformity with written information
furnished to the Company by the Initial Purchasers expressly for use therein; and to reimburse the Company and each such director or controlling person for any and all expenses (including the fees and disbursements of counsel) as such expenses are
reasonably incurred by the Company or such director or controlling person in connection with investigating, defending, settling, compromising or paying any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action. The Company hereby acknowledges that
the only information that the Initial Purchasers have furnished to the Company expressly for use in the Pricing Disclosure Package, any Company Additional Written Information or the Final Offering Memorandum (or any amendment or supplement thereto)
are the statements set forth in the 8th, 9th and 14th paragraphs under the caption Plan of Distribution in the Preliminary Offering Memorandum and the Final Offering Memorandum. The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 8(b)
shall be in addition to any liabilities that each Initial Purchaser may otherwise have.  (c) Notifications and Other
Indemnification Procedures. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying
party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof, but the omission so
  
 20 






 
to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party for contribution or otherwise than under the indemnity agreement contained in
this Section 8 or to the extent it is not prejudiced as a proximate result of such failure. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and such indemnified party seeks or intends to seek indemnity from an indemnifying
party, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in and, to the extent that it shall elect, jointly with all other indemnifying parties similarly notified, by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving
the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof; provided, however, if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably
concluded that a conflict may arise between the positions of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in conducting the defense of any such action the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assume
such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of such indemnifying partys election so
to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 8 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such
indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall
not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (together with local counsel), approved by the indemnifying party (Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. in the case of Sections 8(b) and 9 hereof), representing the indemnified parties
who are parties to such action).  (d) Settlements. The indemnifying party under this Section 8 shall not be liable
for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim,
damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or
threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity was or could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent
(i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding and (ii) does not include any statements as to or any findings of fault,
culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.  SECTION 9. Contribution. If the
indemnification provided for in Section 8 hereof is for any reason held to be unavailable to or otherwise insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein,
then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such indemnified party, as incurred, as a result of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein (i) in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause
(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in
  
 21 






 
such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Initial
Purchasers, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the
Company, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the
offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the total discount received by the Initial Purchasers bear to the aggregate initial offering price of the Securities. The relative fault
of the Company, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state
a material fact or any such inaccurate or alleged inaccurate representation or warranty relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, and the parties relative intent, knowledge,
access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission or inaccuracy.  The amount paid or
payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8 hereof, any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably
incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim. The provisions set forth in Section 8 hereof with respect to notice of commencement of any action shall apply if a claim for contribution is to be made
under this Section 9; provided, however, that no additional notice shall be required with respect to any action for which notice has been given under Section 8 hereof for purposes of indemnification.  The Company and the Initial Purchasers agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were
determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Initial Purchasers were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 9.
 Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, no Initial Purchaser shall be required to contribute any amount in
excess of the discount received by such Initial Purchaser in connection with the Securities distributed by it. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11 of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Initial Purchasers obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several, and not joint, in proportion to their respective commitments as
set forth opposite their names in Schedule A. For purposes of this Section 9, each director, officer and employee of an Initial Purchaser and each person, if any, who controls an Initial Purchaser within the meaning of the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Initial Purchaser, and each director of the Company, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the
same rights to contribution as the Company.  SECTION 10. Termination of this Agreement. Prior to the Closing Date, this
Agreement may be terminated by the Representative by notice given to the Company if at any time (i) trading in securities generally on either the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or materially limited, or minimum or maximum
prices shall have been generally established on
  
 22 






 
any of such stock exchanges by the Commission or the FINRA; (ii) a general banking moratorium shall have been declared by any federal or New York authority or a material disruption in
commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States has occurred; or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of national or international hostilities or any crisis or calamity, or any change
in the United States or international financial markets, or any substantial change or development involving a prospective substantial change in United States or international political, financial or economic conditions, as in the judgment of
the Representative is material and adverse and makes it impracticable or inadvisable to market the Securities in the manner and on the terms described in the Offering Memorandum or to enforce contracts for the sale of securities.  SECTION 11. Representations and Indemnities to Survive Delivery. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties
and other statements of the Company, its officers and the several Initial Purchasers set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Initial Purchaser,
the Company, or any of their partners, officers or directors or any controlling person, as the case may be, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities sold hereunder and any termination of this Agreement.  SECTION 12. Notices. All communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be mailed, hand delivered, couriered or facsimiled
and confirmed to the parties hereto as follows:  If to the Initial Purchasers:  Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.  60 Wall Street  New York, New York 10005  Facsimile: 212-797-9344  Attention: ECM Syndicate  with a copy to:  Davis Polk & Wardwell  450 Lexington Avenue  New York, New York 10017  Facsimile: 212-450-3674  Attention: Richard D.

 SECTION 13. Successors. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto, including
any substitute Initial Purchasers pursuant to Section 16 hereof, and to the benefit of the indemnified parties referred to in Sections 8 and 9 hereof, and in each case their respective successors, and no other person will have any right or
obligation hereunder. The term successors shall not include any Subsequent Purchaser of other purchaser of the Securities as such from any of the Initial Purchasers merely by reason of such purchase.  SECTION 14. Partial Unenforceability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any section, paragraph or provision of this Agreement
shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other section, paragraph or provision hereof. If any section, paragraph or provision of this Agreement is for any reason determined to be invalid or unenforceable, there shall be deemed to be
made such minor changes (and only such minor changes) as are necessary to make it valid and enforceable.  SECTION 15.
Governing Law Provisions. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK APPLICABLE TO AGREEMENTS MADE AND TO BE PERFORMED IN SUCH STATE WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF LAW
PRINCIPLES THEREOF.  SECTION 16. Default of One or More of the Several Initial Purchasers. If any one or more of the
several Initial Purchasers shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities that it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on the Closing Date, and the aggregate number of Securities which such defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers agreed
but failed or refused to purchase does not exceed 10% of the aggregate number of the Securities to be purchased on such date, the other Initial Purchasers shall be obligated, severally, in the proportions that the number of Securities set forth
opposite their respective names on Schedule A bears to the aggregate number of Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Initial Purchasers, or in such other proportions as may be specified by the Initial Purchasers with the
consent of the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers, to purchase the Securities which such defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers agreed but failed or refused to purchase on the Closing Date. If any one or more of the Initial Purchasers
shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities and the aggregate number of Securities with respect to which such default occurs exceeds 10% of the aggregate number of Securities to be purchased on the Closing Date, and arrangements
  
 24 






 
satisfactory to the Initial Purchasers and the Company for the purchase of such Securities are not made within 48 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability of any
party to any other party except that the provisions of Sections 4, 6, 8 and 9 hereof shall at all times be effective and shall survive such termination. In any such case either the Initial Purchasers or the Company shall have the right to
postpone the Closing Date, as the case may be, but in no event for longer than seven days in order that the required changes, if any, to the Final Offering Memorandum or any other documents or arrangements may be effected.  As used in this Agreement, the term Initial Purchaser shall be deemed to include any person substituted for a defaulting Initial
Purchaser under this Section 16. Any action taken under this Section 16 shall not relieve any defaulting Initial Purchaser from liability in respect of any default of such Initial Purchaser under this Agreement.  SECTION 17. No Advisory or Fiduciary Responsibility. The Company acknowledges and agrees that: (i) the purchase and sale of the
Securities pursuant to this Agreement, including the determination of the offering price of the Securities and any related discounts and commissions, is an arms-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the
several Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, and the Company is capable of evaluating and understanding and understands and accepts the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) in connection with
each transaction contemplated hereby and the process leading to such transaction each Initial Purchaser is and has been acting solely as a principal and is not the agent or fiduciary of the Company or its affiliates, stockholders, creditors or
employees or any other party; (iii) no Initial Purchaser has assumed or will assume an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to any of the transactions contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto
(irrespective of whether such Initial Purchaser has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) or any other obligation of the Company except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement; (iv) the several Initial
Purchasers and their respective affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Company and that the several Initial Purchasers have no obligation to disclose any of such interests by
virtue of any fiduciary or advisory relationship; and (v) the Initial Purchasers have not provided any legal, accounting, regulatory or tax advice with respect to the offering contemplated hereby and the Company has consulted its own legal,
accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate.  This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements
and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the several Initial Purchasers, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. The Company hereby waives and releases, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any
claims that the Company may have against the several Initial Purchasers with respect to any breach or alleged breach of fiduciary duty.  SECTION 18. General Provisions. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties to this Agreement and supersedes all prior written or oral and all contemporaneous oral agreements,
understandings and negotiations with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each one of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the
same instrument. This Agreement may not be amended or modified unless in writing by all of the parties hereto, and no condition herein (express or implied) may be waived unless waived in writing by each party whom the condition is meant to benefit.
The section headings herein are for the convenience of the parties only and shall not affect the construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

 EXHIBIT A-1  Opinion of outside counsel to the Company to be delivered pursuant to Section 5 of the Purchase Agreement.  (i) The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of
Delaware.  (ii) Each of the Purchase Agreement and the Certificate of Designation has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by the Company.  (iii) The shares of Common Stock into which the Securities are convertible at the initial
conversion price provided in the Certificate of Designation have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company and reserved for issuance upon such conversion and, upon issuance of such shares of Common Stock on conversion of
the Securities in accordance with the terms of the Certificate of Designation at conversion prices at or in excess of the par value of such shares of Common Stock, will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. There are no preemptive rights
to acquire any such shares of Common Stock set forth in the Companys Certificate of Incorporation or in the Delaware General Corporation Law.  (iv) The Securities conform in all material respects to the descriptions thereof contained in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Final Offering Memorandum.  (v) The documents incorporated by reference in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Final Offering Memorandum (other than the financial
statements, financial schedules and other financial or accounting information and oil and gas reserve data included therein or omitted therefrom, as to which no opinion need be rendered), when they were filed with the Commission, appeared on their
face to comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act.  (vi) The statements in the
Offering Memorandum under the caption Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations insofar as such statements summarize legal matters, legal agreements or legal conclusions discussed therein, fairly present in all material
respects such legal matters or legal conclusions.  (vii) The execution and delivery of the Purchase Agreement and the
Securities by the Company and the performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder (other than performance by the Company of its obligations under the indemnification and contribution sections of the Purchase Agreement, as to which no
opinion need be rendered) (i) will not result in any violation of the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws (or other applicable organizational document) of the Company or any subsidiary; (ii) will not constitute a breach
of, or Default or a Debt Repayment Triggering Event under, the Senior Credit Facility, dated November 21, 2006, by and among SandRidge Energy, Inc. (as successor by merger to Riata Energy, Inc.) and Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative
Agent and Banc of America Securities LLC as Lead Arranger and Book Running Manager, as amended; or (iii) to the best knowledge of such counsel, will not result in any violation of any statute, law, rule, judgment, regulation,
  
 A-1-1 






 
order or decree applicable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries of any court, regulatory body, administrative agency, governmental body, arbitrator or other authority having jurisdiction
over the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of its or their properties; except in the case of clause (ii) and (iii), such breaches, defaults and violations that would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; provided
however, we express no opinion in this paragraph (ix) with respect to federal or state securities laws or blue sky laws, rules or regulations or any state or federal anti-fraud statute, rule or regulation.  (viii) The Company is not, and after receipt of payment for the Securities will not be, an investment company within the meaning
of Investment Company Act.  (ix) Assuming the accuracy of the representations, warranties and covenants of the Company and the
Initial Purchasers contained herein, no registration of the Securities under the Securities Act is required in connection with the purchase of the Securities by the Initial Purchasers or the initial resale of the Securities by the Initial Purchasers
to Qualified Institutional Buyers in the manner contemplated by this Agreement and the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Final Offering Memorandum. Such counsel need express no opinion, however, as to when or under what circumstances any Securities
initially sold by the Initial Purchasers may be reoffered or resold.  In addition, such counsel shall state that they have
participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company, representatives of the independent public or certified public accountants for the Company and with representatives of the Initial Purchasers and their counsel at
which the contents of the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Final Offering Memorandum and related matters were discussed and, although such counsel is not passing upon and does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or
fairness of the statements contained in the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Final Offering Memorandum (other than as specified above), on the basis of the foregoing, nothing has come to their attention which would lead them to believe that the
Pricing Disclosure Package, as of the Time of Sale, or that the Final Offering Memorandum, as of its date or at the Closing Date, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (it being understood that such counsel need express no belief as to the financial statements or other financial or accounting or oil
and gas reserve data, included in or omitted from the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Final Offering Memorandum).  In
rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely as to matters involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the laws of the State of Texas, the contract laws of the State of New
York or the federal law of the United States, to the extent they deem proper and specified in such opinion, upon the opinion (which shall be dated the Closing Date shall be satisfactory in form and substance to the Initial Purchasers, shall
expressly state that the Initial Purchasers may rely on such opinion as if it were addressed to them and shall be furnished to the Initial Purchasers) of other counsel of good standing whom they believe to be reliable and who are satisfactory to
counsel for the Initial Purchasers.   
 A-1-2 






 EXHIBIT A-2  Opinion of counsel for the Company to be delivered pursuant to Section 5 of the Purchase Agreement.  (i) The Company has corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct its business as described in the
Pricing Disclosure Package and the Final Offering Memorandum and to enter into and perform its obligations under the Purchase Agreement, the Certificate of Designation and the Securities.  (ii) The Company is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to transact business and is in good standing in each other jurisdiction in which
such qualification is required, whether by reason of the ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of business, except for such jurisdictions where the failure to so qualify or to be in good standing would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.  (iii) The Company and each subsidiary possess such valid and current certificates,
authorizations or permits issued by the appropriate state, federal or foreign regulatory agencies or bodies necessary to conduct their respective businesses, and, to such counsels knowledge, neither the Company nor any subsidiary has received
any notice of proceedings relating to the revocation or modification of, or non-compliance with, any such certificate, authorization or permit which, singly or in the aggregate, if the subject of an unfavorable decision, ruling or finding, could
have a Material Adverse Effect.  (iv) After due inquiry, such counsel does not know of any legal or governmental actions,
suits or proceedings pending or, to the best of such counsels knowledge, threatened (i) against or affecting the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (ii) which has as the subject thereof any officer or director of, or property owned
or leased by, the Company or any of its subsidiaries or (iii) relating to environmental or discrimination matters, where in any such case (A) there is a reasonable possibility that such action, suit or proceeding might be determined
adversely to the Company or such subsidiary and (B) any such action, suit or proceeding, if so determined adversely, would reasonably be expected to, singly or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect or adversely affect the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. After due inquiry, such counsel does not know of any existing or, to the best of such counsels knowledge, threatened or pending, material labor dispute with the employees of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries, or with the employees of any principal supplier of the Company.  (v) To the best knowledge
of such counsel, neither the Company nor any subsidiary is in violation of its charter, by-laws or other organizational document, as the case may be.  In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely as to matters involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the laws of the State
of Texas, or the federal law of the United States, to the extent they deem proper and specified in such opinion, upon the opinion (which shall be dated the Closing Date shall be satisfactory in form and substance to the Initial Purchasers, shall
expressly state that the Initial Purchasers may rely on such opinion as if it were addressed to them and shall be furnished to the Initial Purchasers) of other counsel of good standing whom they believe to be reliable and who are satisfactory to
counsel for the Initial Purchasers.
