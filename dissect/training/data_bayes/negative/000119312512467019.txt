Party harmless in connection with such acquisition excluding any Proceedings (as hereinafter defined) arising out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Acquiring Party, which agreement shall be reasonably satisfactory to the parties
thereto, and (B) the Acquiring Party shall, after Company has paid the invoice amount and executed the written agreement provided for above, (x) if the acquisition has closed, execute and deliver a written assignment to Company in
recordable form, if applicable, covering the acquired OGM Interests, which assignment shall be with special warranty of title only and shall otherwise be in form reasonably acceptable to the parties thereto, or (y) if the acquisition has not

 7.4 Binding Effect; Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the
benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns; provided, however, that neither this Agreement nor any rights hereunder may be assigned by either of the Parties without the prior written consent of the
other Party.  7.5 Amendments; Waivers. This Agreement may not be modified or amended except by an instrument or
instruments in writing signed by the Parties. Any Party may, only by an instrument in writing, waive compliance by another Party with any term or provision of this Agreement on the part of such other Party to be performed or complied with. The
waiver by any Party of a breach of any term or provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach.  7.6 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of applicable Law or public policy, all other conditions and
provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any adverse manner to any Party. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the
end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the fullest extent possible.  7.7 Survival. The

Agreement. The provisions of Section 2.2 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement for six (6) months; provided that if (i) this Agreement is terminated by Consultant pursuant to Section 6.3(a)
or (b) or (ii) Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.2(c), then such provisions of Section 2.2 shall not survive such termination; provided, however, that in all cases any claims
related to the period of time prior to the termination of the applicability of the provisions of Section 2.2, shall survive such termination.  7.8 Force Majeure. In the event of either Party being rendered unable, wholly or in part, by Force Majeure to carry out its obligations under this Agreement other than to make payments due
hereunder, it is agreed that on such Partys giving notice and full particulars of such Force Majeure in writing or by telecopy to the other Party as soon as possible after the occurrence of the cause relied on, then the obligations of the
Party giving such notice, so far as they are affected by such Force Majeure, shall be suspended during the continuance of any inability so caused but for no longer period. Force Majeure means any of the following which

transporters, failure to obtain applicable permits, and any other causes whether of the kind herein enumerated or otherwise, which are not anticipated at the time of execution hereof.

agreement, and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other.  7.10 Facsimile Signatures.
