In the event all Earning Obligations have been completed or Terra Nova has elected not to proceed to the next phase, Terra Nova may direct that the Escrow Agent release the funds to Terra Nova.




 





2.9  


The Parties agree that in the event any well drilled in connection with the Initial Well Program or the Option Well Program is a commercially viable producer of petroleum substances, and Terra Nova has elected to complete such well (a “Successful Well”), Terra Nova shall be entitled to a preferential recovery of an amount equal to one hundred percent of the costs it has paid to drill and test that Successful Well (a “Successful Well Cost Recovery Amount”).  Terra Nova shall receive and be entitled to 80% of production from the Successful Well until either:




 





(a)  


such Successful Well has ceased production and is subsequently abandoned; or




 





(b)  


Terra Nova has received Net Revenue attributable to the Successful Well equal to the Successful Well Cost Recovery Amount;




 

following which, the Parties shall be entitled to a Working Interest share of the production equal to their Working Interest at the time the oil and gas is produced in accordance with the JOA.  For the purposes of calculating the “Net Revenue” attributable to a Successful Well, Net Revenue shall be the gross proceeds from Terra Nova’s sale of its 80% of the oil and gas from the Successful Well, less:

 





(i)  


permit rentals and maintenance cost;




 





(ii)

2.11  


In the event that any of the Current Working Interest Holders do not pay their share of the costs which they are required to pay under this Agreement or the JOA, Terra Nova may proceed with the operation associated with such costs as a Sole Risk Operation, as such term is defined in the JOA and the consequences specified in the JOA shall be applicable to the non-participating Current Working Interest Holder. The premium specified in the JOA payable to Terra Nova shall be applicable to the non-participating Current Working Interest Holder’s share of the 20% of Net Revenue received pursuant to section 2.9 and after Terra Nova’s recovery of the Successful Well Cost Recovery Amount, such Party’s Working Interest share of production.




 





2.12  


In the event that costs are incurred with respect to operations on the Licences prior to the completion of the Earning Obligations or the termination of this Agreement which are costs other than those associated with the Earning Obligations or the Completion of the Wells drilled in order to satisfy the Earning Obligations, such costs shall be paid in accordance with the Parties’ Working Interests as if Terra Nova had earned the Farm-In Interest.  In the event that Terra Nova does not subsequently earn the entire Farm-in Interest, Terra Nova shall be entitled to a credit for the amount of the difference between what Terra Nova paid and what they would have paid based on the Working Interest Terra Nova actually earned, such credit to be applied to 50% of future cash calls to be paid by Terra Nova pursuant to the JOA.




 





2.13  


Terra Nova agrees that HEC may nominate a mutually acceptable candidate for a seat on the board of directors of Terra Nova which upon qualification by the current members of the Terra Nova board and approval of the Exchange shall be appointed to hold office until successors are elected.

In the event Terra Nova terminates the Agreement hereunder, it shall not be entitled to any interest in either License unless it has satisfied an Earning Obligation in respect of such License(s) (in which case Terra Nova shall be entitled to the interest it has earned in the relevant License) and shall not be entitled to any refund or reimbursement of amounts paid to HEC or Shares issued to the Current Working Interest Holders under the Agreement.

ARTICLE 7

SHARING OF AND CONFIDENTIAL NATURE OF INFORMATION

 





7.1  


Each Party agrees that all Confidential Information obtained hereunder shall be the exclusive property of the Parties and shall not be publicly disclosed or used other than for the activities contemplated hereunder, except as required by law or by the rules and regulations of any regulatory authority or stock exchange having jurisdiction, or with the written consent of the other Parties, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. Where a Party releases Confidential Information based on a requirement at law or under the rules and regulations of any regulatory authority or stock exchange having jurisdiction it will deliver a copy concurrently to the other Parties.




 





7.2  


Consent to disclosure of Confidential Information pursuant to Article 7.1 shall not be unreasonably withheld where a Party wishes to disclose any such information to a third party for the purpose of arranging financing for its contributions hereunder or for the purpose of selling its interest in the Licenses, provided that such third party gives its undertaking to the Parties that any such information not theretofore publicly disclosed shall be kept confidential and not disclosed to others.




 





7.3 


Except as provided for in Article 7.1, a party hereto (the “Issuing Party”) will not issue any press release concerning the Licenses or this Agreement without first delivering a copy of the proposed release to each of the other Parties (each, a “Commenting Party”) for comment, and if such comment is not forthcoming from each Commenting Party within two Business Days of such delivery, such press release may be issued without the comment or consent of such Commenting Party, but the Issuing Party will deliver a copy of the press release to such Commenting Party concurrently with its release by the Issuing Party. If a Commenting Party does provide comments on a press release, then the Issuing Party and such Commenting Party, each acting reasonably, will try to agree on a mutually acceptable press release within one Business Day. If the Parties are unable to so agree, then the Issuing Party will be entitled to issue the press release as it sees fit, but will note in the body of the press release that such Commenting Party does not endorse or support the contents of the press release.




 





7.4 


No Party shall be liable to any other for the fraudulent or negligent disclosure of Confidential Information by any of its employees, servants or agents, provided that such Party has taken reasonable steps to ensure the preservation of the confidential nature of such Confidential Information.




 

ARTICLE 8

RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER

 





8.1  


Subject to Article 8.3 and the limitations set forth in the JOA, any Party may sell, transfer, assign or otherwise dispose of (“Assign”, or an “Assignment”) all or any portion of its right, title and interest in and to this Agreement to a third party (“New Party”) with the consent of the other Parties hereto, which consent may be unreasonably withheld.




 





8.2  


Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Party may, without the consent of the other Parties, Assign any or all of its interest or its rights under this Agreement to an Affiliate, provided that such Affiliate first complies with the provisions of Article 8.3 and agrees with the other Parties in writing to re-transfer such interest to the originally assigning Party before ceasing to be an Affiliate of such Party.




 

 






Oil & Gas Farm-In Agreement with Terra Nova




  



15







  



 





8.3  


Before the completion of any Assignment by a Party of its interest or rights under this Agreement, to an Affiliate or otherwise, the New Party may, but is not required, at the election of any Party not selling, to enter into an agreement with each such Party not selling on the same terms and conditions as set out in this Agreement.




 





8.4  


Other than as required and allowed elsewhere in this Agreement, a Party shall not dispose of any of its interest in this Agreement or its Working Interest, whether by assignment, sale, trade, lease, sublease, farmout or otherwise, without first complying with the following:




 





(a)  


The party wishing to make the disposition (in this Section 8.4 called the “disposing party”) shall, by notice, advise each other party (in this Section 8.4 called an “offeree”) of its intention to make the disposition, including in such notice a description of the interest proposed to be disposed, the identity of the proposed assignee, the price or other consideration for which the disposing party is prepared to make such disposition, the proposed effective date and closing date of the transaction and any other information respecting the transaction which the disposing party reasonably believes would be material to the exercise of the offerees’ rights hereunder (such notice in this Section 8.4 called the “disposition notice”);




 





(b)  


In the event the consideration described in the disposition notice cannot be matched in kind and the disposition notice does not include the disposing party’s bona fide estimate of the value, in cash, of such consideration, an offeree may, within seven (7) days of the receipt by the offerees of the disposition notice, request the disposing party to provide such estimate to the offerees, whereupon the disposing party shall provide such estimate in a timely manner and the election period provided herein to the offerees shall be suspended until such estimate is received by the offerees;




 





(c)  


In the event of a dispute as to the reasonableness of an estimate of the cash value of the consideration described in the disposition notice or provided pursuant to Subclause (b). as the case may be, the matter shall be referred to arbitration, to be decided by a single arbitrator, under the provisions of the Arbitration Act (Alberta) within seven (7) days of the receipt of such estimate. The disposing party and the applicable offeree shall thereupon diligently attempt to complete such arbitration in a timely manner. The equivalent cash consideration determined in such arbitration shall thereupon be deemed to be the sale price for the working interest described in the disposition notice;




 





(d)  


Within the later of: i) thirty (30) days from the receipt of the disposition notice, as modified by any suspension pursuant to Subclause (b); or ii), if applicable, fifteen (15) days from receipt of notice of the arbitrated value determined pursuant to the preceding Subclause, an offeree may give notice to the disposing party that it elects to purchase the working Interest described in the disposition notice for the applicable price (in this Section 8.4 called a “notice of acceptance”). A notice of acceptance shall create a binding contractual obligation upon the disposing pasty to sell, and upon an offeree giving a notice of acceptance to purchase, for the applicable price, all of the Working Interest included in such disposition notice on the terms and conditions set forth in the disposition notice. However, if more than one offeree gives a notice of acceptance, each such offeree shall purchase the Working Interest to which such notice of acceptance pertains in the proportion its Working Interest bears to the total Working Interest of such offerees.  Where Terra Nova issues a notice of acceptance and for the purpose of determining the Working Interest that each can acquire from the disposing party, the Parties shall be deemed to have a Working Interest equal to the Working Interest they would have following Terra Nova’s earning of the Farm-In Interest.




 





(e)  


In the event that the Working Interest described in the disposition notice is not disposed of to one or more of the offerees pursuant to the preceding Subclause, the disposition to the proposed assignee shall be subject to the consent of the offerees. Such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, and it shall be reasonable for an offeree to withhold its consent to the disposition if it reasonably believes that the disposition would be likely to have a material adverse effect on it, its Working Interest or operations to be conducted hereunder, including, without limiting the generality of all or any part of the foregoing, a reasonable belief that the proposed assignee does not have the financial capability to meet prospective obligations arising out of this Agreement or the JOA. However, an offeree shall be deemed to have consented to the disposition to the proposed assignee, unless, within the time period prescribed in Subclause (d) the offeree advises the other parties, by notice, that it is not prepared to consent to such disposition.




 

 






Oil & Gas Farm-In Agreement with Terra Nova




  



16







  



 





(f)  


If the Working Interest described in the disposition notice is not disposed of to one or more of the offerees pursuant to Subclause (d), the disposing party may, subject to obtaining the consents prescribed by the preceding Subclause, dispose of such Working Interest at any time within one hundred and fifty (150) days from the issuance of such disposition notice, provided that such disposition is not on terms that are more favourable to such purchaser than those offered in the disposition notice.




 





(g)  


Following a disposition herein or one hundred and fifty (150) days following the issuance of a disposition notice from which a disposition did not result, as the case may be, the provisions of this Section 8.4 shall once again apply to the Working Interest described in the disposition notice.




 





8.5  


Each Party agrees that its failure to comply with the restrictions set out in this Article would constitute an injury and damage to the other Parties impossible to measure monetarily and, in the event of any such failure each of the other Parties shall, in addition and without prejudice to any other rights and remedies at law or in equity, be entitled to injunctive relief restraining or enjoining any sale of any interest or Assignment of any rights under this Agreement save in accordance with the provisions of this Article, and any Party intending to make a sale or making a sale contrary to the provisions of this Article hereby waives any defense it might have in law to such injunctive relief.




 

ARTICLE 9

AMALGAMATION OR REORGANIZATION
