3.                                       Shares for the Plan
 
There is reserved for issuance and purchase by employees under the Plan an aggregate of 2,000,000 shares of Company Stock, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 13.  Shares subject to the Plan shall be authorized but unissued shares. Shares needed to satisfy the needs of the Plan may be newly issued by the Company or acquired by purchase at the expense of the Company on the open market or in private transactions.
 
4.                                       Administration of the Plan
 
The Plan shall be administered by the Committee. Subject to the express provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall have the authority to take any and all actions (including directing the Custodian as to the acquisition of shares) necessary to implement the Plan and to interpret the Plan, to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to it, and to make all other determinations necessary or advisable in administering the Plan.
 
All such determinations shall be final and binding upon all persons. A quorum of the Committee shall consist of a majority of its members and the Committee may act by vote of a majority of its members at a meeting at which a quorum is present, or without a meeting by a written consent to their action taken signed by all members of the Committee. The Committee may request advice or assistance or employ such other persons as are necessary for proper administration of the Plan. The Committee may delegate administration of the Plan to one or more employees or positions of the Company or any Subsidiary.  All rules and determinations by the Committee or its delegate in the administration of the Plan shall be uniformly and consistently applied to all persons in similar circumstances.
 
5.                                       Eligibility
 
Except as hereinafter provided, an employee of the Company, its current Subsidiaries listed on Exhibit A attached hereto or such of its future participating Subsidiaries as may from time to time be designated by the Committee and listed on Exhibit A shall be eligible to participate in the Plan.  The Committee may amend Exhibit A from time to time to remove any Subsidiaries from participation in the Plan.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following individuals shall not be eligible to participate in the Plan: (i) any employee who is employed for less than one year prior to the Grant Date, (ii) any employee whose customary employment is twenty hours or less per week as of the Grant Date, (iii) any employee whose customary employment is for not more than five months in any calendar year, (iv) any director of the Company or of any Subsidiary who is not an
 
3







 
employee, (ii) any independent contractor who is not an employee, and (iii) any employee who is a citizen or resident of a foreign jurisdiction and such jurisdiction would prohibit a grant of an option under the Plan or compliance with such jurisdiction would cause the Plan to violate the requirements of Code Section 423.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of an acquisition by the Company or one or more of its Subsidiaries of the business of a person or entity, whether by asset purchase, stock purchase, merger or otherwise, an authorized officer of the Company shall have sole discretion (without the consent of any Participant) to modify the eligibility and participation requirements of the Plan as they relate to those employees of the acquired person or entity who become employees of the Company, its current Subsidiaries or its future participating Subsidiaries; provided, however, any such modification which requires shareholder approval under the Code shall not be made without such shareholder approval.
 
6.             Election to Participate
 
An Eligible Employee may elect to participate as of the first day of any Offering Period by completing an Enrollment Form and filing such Enrollment Form by the deadline established by the Committee or its delegate, in its discretion, which deadline shall be applied uniformly to all employees.  If the Enrollment Form is not completed and timely filed by the established deadline, then such employee shall be eligible to participate in the Plan as of the first day of the next Offering Period that begins following the receipt by the Committee of a completed Enrollment Form.  All Eligible Employees shall have the same rights and privileges within the meaning of Code Section 423(b)(5).
 
Each Eligible Employee may become a Participant by timely filing with the Committee or its delegate an Enrollment Form in accordance with the foregoing authorizing specified regular payroll deductions from his or her Compensation.  The Committee, in its discretion, shall establish the minimum and maximum Compensation, expressed either as a percentage or in a flat dollar amount, that a Participant may elect to contribute, provided such limits are applied uniformly to all Participants.  All regular payroll deductions shall be credited to the Payroll Deduction Account that the Company has established in the name of the Participant.
 
A Participant may increase or decrease his or her payroll deduction, subject to any contribution limits, by filing a new Enrollment Form.  Any change in payroll deduction will be effective as of the payroll period following the date of the Participants election, or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter.
 
Subject to Section 14, a Participant may also cease his or her participation in the Plan at any time.  If a Participant ceases his or her participation during an Offering Period, then he or she may elect to either (i) apply any payroll deductions credited to his or her Payroll Deduction Account prior to the date such cessation is effective towards the purchase of shares of Company Stock during such Offering Period, or (ii) receive a refund of any payroll deductions credited to his or her Payroll Deduction Account for such Offering Period.  Any such cessation shall be effective as of the payroll period following the date of the Participants request to cease participation, or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter.  If elected, any refund will be made as soon as administratively practicable.  An Eligible Employee who has ceased to be a
 
4






 
Participant may not again resume participation in the Plan until such Eligible Employee has complied with the foregoing provisions of this Section.
 
7.             Method of Purchase and Investment Accounts
 
Each Participant having eligible funds in his or her Payroll Deduction Account on an Investment Date shall be deemed, without any further action, to have purchased the number of shares of Company Stock (including fractional shares unless otherwise determined by the Committee) which the eligible funds in his or her Payroll Deduction Account could purchase on that Investment Date at that Purchase Price.
 
All shares purchased shall be maintained by the Custodian in a separate Investment Account for each Participant. All cash dividends paid with respect to shares of the Company Stock held in the Investment Account shall be added to a Participants Payroll Deduction Account and shall be used to purchase shares of Company Stock for the Participants Investment Account. Expenses incurred in the purchase of such shares shall be paid by the Company.
 
All dividends distributed in-kind with respect to Company Stock held in the Investment Account shall be added to the shares held for a Participant in his or her Investment Account. Any distribution of shares with respect to shares of Company Stock held for a Participant in his or her Investment Account shall be added to the shares of Company Stock held for a Participant in his or her Investment Account.
 
8.             Stock Purchases
 
The Custodian shall acquire shares of Company Stock for Participants as of each Investment Date from the Company or, if directed by the Committee, by purchases on the open market or in private transactions using total payroll deduction amounts received by the Custodian. If shares of Company Stock are purchased in one or more transactions on the open market or in private transactions at the direction of the Committee, the Company will pay the Custodian the difference between the Purchase Price and the price at which such shares are purchased for Participants.
 
9.             Limitation on Purchases
 
Unless the Committee determines another limit prior to an Offering Period, no Eligible Employee shall be permitted to purchase more than 2,500  shares of Company Stock during any one Offering Period.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Eligible Employee may be granted any options during any one calendar year which permit his or her rights to purchase shares of Company Stock under all Code Section 423 employee stock purchase plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries to accrue at a rate that exceeds $25,000 of the Fair Market Value of such stock determined on the Grant Date, which limit shall be interpreted to comply with Code Section 423(b)(8).
 
A Participants Payroll Deduction Account may not be used to purchase Company Stock on any Investment Date to the extent that, after such purchase, the Participant would own (or be considered as owning within the meaning of Code Section 424(d)) stock possessing 5% or more of the total combined voting power of the Company or its Parent or Subsidiary. For this purpose,
 
5






 
stock which the Participant may purchase under any outstanding option (whether or not exercisable) shall be treated as owned by such Participant. As of the first Investment Date on which this paragraph limits a Participants ability to purchase Company Stock, the employee shall cease to be a Participant.
 
10.           Title of Accounts
 
The Custodian shall maintain an Investment Account for each Participant.
 
11.           Right to Sell Company Stock in Investment Account
 
A Participant shall have the right at any time to obtain a certificate (if the Company Stock is certificated) for the shares (including fractional shares) of Company Stock credited to his or her Investment Account. Subject to the Companys Insider Trading Policy, a Participant shall have the right at any time to direct that any shares of Company Stock in his or her Investment Account be sold and that the proceeds, less expenses of sale, be remitted to him or her.
 
When a Participant ceases to be a Participant, the Participant may elect to have his or her shares sold by the Custodian and the proceeds, after selling expenses, remitted to him or her or the Participant may elect to have a certificate (if the Company Stock is certificated) for the shares of Company Stock credited to the Participants Investment Account forwarded to him or her. In either event, the Custodian may sell any fractional interest held in the Participants Investment Account to the Company and remit the proceeds of such sale, less selling expenses, and the balance in his or her Payroll Deduction Account to him or her.
 
As a condition of participation in the Plan, each Participant agrees to notify the Company if he or she sells or otherwise disposes of any of his or her shares of Company Stock within two years after the Grant Date or within one year after the Investment Date.
 
12.           Rights Not Transferable
 
Rights under the Plan are not transferable by a Participant, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Rights under the Plan are exercisable during a Participants lifetime only by him or her, pursuant to Section 7.
 
13.           Change in Capital Structure
 
In the event of a stock dividend, spinoff, stock split or combination of shares, recapitalization or merger in which the Company is the surviving corporation or other change in the Companys capital stock (including, but not limited to, the creation or issuance to shareholders generally of rights, options or warrants for the purchase of common stock or preferred stock of the Company), the number and kind of shares of stock or securities of the Company to be subject to the Plan, the maximum number of shares or securities which may be delivered under the Plan, the selling price and other relevant provisions shall be appropriately adjusted by the Committee, whose determination shall be binding on all persons.
 
If the Company is a party to a consolidation or a merger in which the Company is not the surviving corporation, a transaction that results in the acquisition of substantially all of the
 
6






 
Companys outstanding stock by a single person or entity, or a sale or transfer of substantially all of the Companys assets, the Committee may take such actions with respect to the Plan as the Committee deems appropriate.
 
Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, the Committee may take the foregoing actions without the consent of any Participant, and the Committees determination shall be conclusive and binding on all persons for all purposes.
 
14.           Retirement, Termination and Death
 
Notwithstanding any provision in the Plan to the contrary, in the event of a Participants retirement, termination of active employment, or death, all payroll deductions shall cease effective with such event and the amount in his or her Payroll Deduction Account shall be refunded to him or her.  Certificates (if the Company Stock is certificated) will be issued for full shares of Company Stock held in his or her Investment Account if elected with the Custodian and pursuant to the rules of the Custodian.  If a Participant elects to have his or her shares sold, he or she will receive the proceeds of the sale, less selling expenses.  In the event of his or her death, the amount, if any, in his or her Payroll Deduction Account shall be paid to his or her estate, and any shares of Company Stock in his or her Investment Account shall be delivered to any beneficiary he or she has properly designated in forms filed with the Custodian, and if no such designation is on file with the Custodian, then such shares of Company Stock shall be delivered to his or her estate.
 
15.           Amendment of the Plan
 
The Board of Directors may at any time, or from time to time, amend the Plan in any respect; provided, however, that the shareholders of the Company must approve any amendment that would  increase the number of securities that may be issued under the Plan (other than an increase solely to reflect a change in capitalization such as a stock dividend or stock split pursuant to Section 13).
 
16.           Termination of the Plan
 
The Plan and all rights of employees hereunder shall terminate at the discretion of the Board of Directors.  Upon termination of the Plan, all amounts in an employees Payroll Deduction Account that are not used to purchase Company Stock will be refunded.
 
17.           Effective Date of Plan
 
The Plan is effective as of April 20, 2011.
 
18.           Government and Other Regulations
 
The Plan, and the grant and exercise of the rights to purchase shares hereunder, and the Companys obligation to sell and deliver shares upon the exercise of rights to purchase shares, shall be subject to all applicable federal, state and foreign laws, rules and regulations, and to such approvals by any regulatory or government agency as may, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, be required.

19.           Indemnification of Committee

20.           Governing Law
