1.
 The commencement date of your promotion will be January 1, 2013 (the Effective Date). 
 


 
2.
 You will be paid an annualized base salary of three hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars ($325,000). Such salary shall be paid on a monthly
basis on the 1st day of each month for the prior month of
employment in accordance with the Companys customary payroll practices in effect from time to time, less applicable taxes and other withholdings. 
 


 
3.
 The term of your employment will extend to December 31, 2013 with the provision that your employment will automatically extend for an
additional, one-year renewal term on December 31, 2013 and each anniversary thereafter unless written notice of non-renewal 







 
 
is given by either you or the Company to the other party at least thirty (30) days before the expiration of the then-existing term. 
 


 
a.
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement shall terminate immediately upon your death and the Company may terminate your employment at any time
for Cause. Cause shall exist in any of the following circumstances:   


 
i.
 Failure to perform the duties of your job, as determined by the Company;

b.
 Further notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may terminate your Agreement without Cause at any time prior to the expiration of the
then-existing term. In the event that your employment is terminated pursuant to this Section 3(b), then subject to the terms set forth in the following sentence, the Company will provide you with: (i) a one-time, lump sum severance payment
(the Severance Payment) equivalent to the amount of base salary that you would have earned, less applicable taxes and withholdings, had you remained employed between the date of your termination of employment and the expiration of the
term in which your termination of employment occurred; plus (ii) a pro rata portion of any Annual Bonus for the year in which the termination of employment occurred (the Pro Rata Bonus). Your receipt of the Severance Payment and Pro
Rata Bonus referenced in the previous sentence will be subject to your timely delivery to the Company (and non-revocation during any applicable revocation period) by the Release Expiration Date (as defined below) of a release of claims in a form
satisfactory to the Company (the Release), which such Release will release all claims, causes of action and other liabilities against the Company, its affiliates and subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors, managers,
members, fiduciaries, agents, representatives, benefit plans (and the fiduciaries and administrators of such plans) and successors. The Release Expiration Date shall mean the date that is 21 days following the date upon which the Company
timely delivers the Release to you (which shall occur no later than 7 days after the date on which your employment terminates), or in the event that such termination of employment is in connection with an exit incentive or other employment
termination program (as such phrase is defined in the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended), the date that is 45 days following such delivery date. Provided that the above conditions are met, (x) the Severance Payment
shall be provided to you on the date that is the sixtieth day after the date that your employment terminates (or the first business day thereafter if the sixtieth day is not a business day) and (y) the








 
 
Pro Rata Bonus, if any, shall be paid to you on the date that Annual Bonuses are paid to similarly situated employees who have continued employment with the Company (but in no event later than
April 15 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which your employment terminates).   


 
4.
 You will be eligible to receive a discretionary annual bonus for 2013 and each subsequent, calendar year that you are employed hereunder (each, an
Annual Bonus). The Annual Bonus for which you are eligible will be pro-rated for calendar years in which you are employed for only for only a portion of such calendar year. Your maximum Annual Bonus (assuming all bonus targets are met or
exceeded) will be 150% of your annualized base salary and such Annual Bonus will be measured by reference to EBITDA and asset sale goals for the Company and its subsidiaries for the applicable year; provided, however that such goals applicable to
the Annual Bonus for 2013 are set forth on Exhibit A. Each Annual Bonus, if any, shall be paid as soon as practicable after the Companys receipt of certified, audited financial statements for the applicable calendar year to which such
Annual Bonus applies; provided, however that such Annual Bonus, if any, shall be paid no later than March 15 of the calendar year following the calendar year to which the Annual Bonus applies and you will be deemed to have earned such Annual
Bonus only if you are still employed by the Company on such date of payment.   


 
5.
 In addition to the Annual Bonuses, you will be eligible to receive discretionary commission payments (each, a Commission Payment) in the
form of shares of the Companys common stock (Common Stock) or cash, as set forth below, based upon the Companys or its applicable subsidiarys profits from the sale of particular assets in an applicable calendar year, as
determined by the Company. For calendar year 2013, the asset sales that are eligible for a Commission Payment are set forth on Exhibit B. The asset sales that will be eligible for a Commission Payment in years after 2013 will be communicated
by the Company to you in writing as soon as reasonably practicable within those calendar years, as applicable. The amount of each Commission Payment, if any, shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Company. Each Commission Payment, if any,
shall be paid on the date that is the 60th day after the closing of the applicable asset sale; provided, however, that you must be employed by the Company on such date of payment in order to earn the applicable Commission Payment. Subject to the
remainder of this paragraph, the Company shall pay each Commission Payment, if any, to you by issuing you a number of shares of Common Stock with a fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Companys Board of Directors) on the date
of issuance equal to the amount of such Commission Payment less all applicable taxes; provided, however, that (i) the number of shares of Common Stock issued to you in respect of all Commission Payments shall not, in the aggregate, exceed 750
shares of Common Stock and (ii) if, and after, the Company has issued 750 shares of Common Stock to you hereunder, the Company shall pay any additional Commission Payments (or portions thereof), less all applicable taxes, to you in cash.
Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this paragraph, (x) the issuance of shares of Common Stock to you in respect of a Commission Payment (or portion thereof) is subject to compliance with all applicable federal, state, local and foreign
laws, rules and regulations (including, without 







 
 
limitation, federal, state and foreign securities law requirements) and to such approvals by any listing, regulatory or governmental authority as the Company may deem necessary or advisable in
connection therewith and (y) the shares of Common Stock issued to you in respect of a Commission Payment (or portion thereof) may be subject to such restrictions, and the Company may request that you provide such assurances and representations
to the Company, in each case, as the Company may deem necessary or desirable to assure compliance with all applicable legal requirements.  The Company will also provide additional employee benefits that are similar to those benefits made available to similarly situated employees, and which may be changed from time to time. Your benefit
participation will be subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable program and plans. Benefits currently offered by the Company include:   


 
1.
 Employee Health/Vision Insurance: The Company pays 100% of the premium for single or family coverage. This benefit is currently provided by Anthem
