CERTAIN RATE PROVISIONS




Section 4.1 Taxes.  The Borrower covenants and agrees as follows with respect to Taxes.




(a) Any and all payments by the Borrower and each other Obligor under each Loan Document shall be made without setoff, counterclaim or other defense, and free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any Taxes. In the event that any Taxes are imposed and required to be deducted or withheld from any payment required to be made to or on behalf of any Secured Party under any Loan Document, then:

 

(i) subject to clause (f), if such Taxes are Non-Excluded Taxes, the Borrower and each Obligor shall increase the amount of such payment so that each Secured Party receives an amount sufficient to put it and its Tax Related Persons in the same after-Tax position they would have been in, after withholding and deduction and payment of all Taxes (including income Taxes) had no such deduction or withholding been made; and

 

(ii) the Borrower or the Agent (as applicable) shall withhold the full amount of such Taxes from such payment (as increased pursuant to clause (a)(i)) and shall pay such amount to the Governmental Authority imposing such Taxes in accordance with Applicable Law.

 

(b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay all Other Taxes imposed to the relevant Governmental Authority imposing such Other Taxes in accordance with Applicable Law.

 

(c) As promptly as practicable after the payment of any Taxes that the Borrower is required to pay on account of any payment made or required to be made under any Loan Document, and in any event within 45 days of any such payment being due, the Borrower shall furnish to the Agent an official receipt (or a certified copy thereof) or other proof of payment satisfactory to the Agent, acting reasonably, evidencing the payment of such Taxes or Other Taxes. The Agent shall make copies thereof available to any Lender upon request therefor.

 

(d) Subject to clause (f), the Borrower shall indemnify each Secured Party for any Non-Excluded Taxes and Other Taxes levied, imposed or assessed on (and whether or not paid directly by) such Secured Party whether or not such Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes are correctly or legally asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. In addition, the Borrower shall indemnify each Secured Party for any Taxes that may become payable by such Secured Party or its Tax Related Persons as a result of indemnification payments (net of any reduction in Taxes resulting from the losses being indemnified) or as a result of any failure of the Borrower to pay any Taxes when due to the appropriate Governmental Authority or to deliver to the Agent, pursuant to clause (c), documentation evidencing the payment of Taxes or Other Taxes. With respect to indemnification for Non-Excluded Taxes and Other Taxes actually  paid  by  any  Secured  Party  or  the  indemnification  provided  in  the  immediately

preceding sentence, such indemnification shall be made within 20 days after the date such Secured Party makes written demand therefor. The Borrower and each other Obligor acknowledges that any payment made to any Secured Party or to any Governmental Authority in respect of the indemnification obligations of the Borrower or other Obligor provided in this clause shall constitute a payment in respect of which the provisions of clause (a) and this clause shall apply.

 

(e) Each Non-U.S. Lender making Loans to the Borrower, on or prior to the date on which such Non-U.S. Lender becomes a Lender hereunder (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the Agent, but only for so long as such non-U.S. Lender is legally entitled to do so), shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent either (i) two duly completed copies of either (x) Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8IMY claiming eligibility of the Non-U.S. Lender for benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party or (y) Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI, or in either case an applicable successor form; (ii) in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender that is not legally entitled to deliver either form listed in clause (e)(i), (x) a certificate to the effect that such Non-U.S. Lender is not (A) a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a controlled foreign corporation receiving interest from a related person within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (referred to as an “Exemption Certificate”) and (y) two duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, W-8EXP, W-8ECI or W-8IMY, as appropriate, or applicable successor form, or (iii) in the case of a Lender that is not a Non-U.S. Lender, two duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service form W-9 or applicable successor form. Each Lender, Eligible Assignee or Participant, as the case may be, agrees to promptly notify the Borrower and the Agent of any change in circumstances that would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction. In addition, each Lender, Eligible Assignee or Participant, as the case may be, shall timely deliver to the Borrower and the Agent two further copies of such Form W-8BEN, W-8EXP, W-8IMY, W-8ECI or W-9 or successor forms on or before the date that any previously executed form expires or becomes obsolete, or after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form delivered by such Person to the Borrower. In addition to the foregoing, each Non-U.S. Lender shall deliver to the Agent and the Borrower any documents as shall be prescribed by Applicable Law or otherwise reasonably requested to demonstrate that payments to such Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are exempt from any United States federal withholding tax imposed pursuant to FATCA, to the extent applicable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, neither the Borrower nor the Agent shall be required to pay additional amounts or indemnify any Lender with respect to any withholding taxes imposed by reason of FATCA.

 

(f) The Borrower shall not be obligated to pay any additional amounts to any Lender pursuant to clause (a)(i), or to indemnify any Lender pursuant to clause (d), in respect of United States federal withholding taxes to the extent imposed as a result of (i) the failure of such Lender to deliver to the Borrower the form or forms and/or an Exemption Certificate, as applicable to such Lender, pursuant to clause (e), (ii) such form or forms and/or Exemption Certificate not establishing a complete exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax or the information or certifications made therein by the Lender being untrue or inaccurate

 



  



-34-







  



 

on the date delivered in any material respect, or (iii) the Lender designating a successor lending office at which it maintains its Loans that has the effect of causing such Lender to become obligated for tax payments in excess of those in effect immediately prior to such designation; provided that, the Borrower shall be obligated to pay additional amounts to any such Lender pursuant to clause (a)(i), and to indemnify any such Lender pursuant to clause (d), in respect of United States federal withholding taxes if (i) any such failure to deliver a form or forms or an Exemption Certificate or the failure of such form or forms or Exemption Certificate  to establish a complete exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax or inaccuracy or untruth contained therein resulted from a change in any applicable statute, treaty, regulation or other Applicable Law or any interpretation of any of the foregoing occurring after the Effective Date, which change rendered such Lender no longer legally entitled to deliver such form or forms or Exemption Certificate or otherwise ineligible for a complete exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax, or rendered the information or certifications made in such form or forms or Exemption Certificate untrue or inaccurate in a material respect, (ii) the redesignation of the Lender’s lending office was made at the request of the Borrower or (iii) the obligation to pay any additional amounts to any such Lender pursuant to clause (a)(i) or to indemnify any such Lender pursuant to clause (d) is with respect to an Assignee Lender that becomes an Assignee Lender as a result of an assignment made at the request of the Borrower.

 

(g) If any Lender makes a demand upon the Borrower for amounts pursuant to this Section 4.1, and the payment of such amounts are, and are likely to continue to be, materially more onerous in the reasonable judgment of the Borrower than with respect to the other Lenders (in each case, an “Affected Lender”), the Borrower may, within 30 days of receipt by the Borrower of such demand, give notice (a “Replacement Notice”) in writing to the Agent and such Affected Lender of its intention to cause such Affected Lender to sell all of its Loans, Commitments and/or Notes to an Eligible Assignee (a “Replacement Lender”) designated in such Replacement Notice; provided, however, that no Replacement Notice may be given by the Borrower and no Lender may be replaced pursuant to this clause (g) if (i) such replacement conflicts with any Applicable Law or regulation, (ii) any Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such replacement or (iii) prior to any such replacement, such Affected Lender shall have taken any necessary action under this Section 4.1 so as to eliminate the continued need for payment of amounts owing pursuant to this Section 4.1 or shall have waived its right to payment of the specific amounts that give rise or would give rise to such Replacement Notice (it being understood for sake of clarity that the Affected Lender shall be under no obligation to waive such rights to payment). If the Agent shall, in the exercise of its reasonable discretion and within 30 days of its receipt of such Replacement Notice, notify the Borrower and such Affected Lender in writing that the Replacement Lender is satisfactory to the Agent (such consent not being required where the Replacement Lender is already a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender), then such Affected Lender shall assign, in accordance with Section 10.11, all of its Commitments, Loans, Notes (if any), and other rights and obligations under this Agreement and all other Loan Documents designated in the replacement notice to such Replacement Lender; provided, however, that (A) such assignment shall be without recourse, representation or warranty and shall be on terms and conditions reasonably satisfactory to such Affected Lender and such Replacement Lender, (B) the purchase price paid by such Replacement Lender shall be in the amount of such Affected Lender’s Loans designated in the Replacement Notice, together with all accrued

and unpaid interest and fees in respect thereof, plus all other amounts (including the amounts demanded and unreimbursed under this Section 4.1) and including any call premiums, owing to such Affected Lender hereunder and (C) the Borrower shall pay to the Affected Lender and the Agent all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Affected Lender and the Agent in connection with such assignment and assumption (including the processing fees described in Section 10.11). Upon the effective date of an assignment described above, the Replacement Lender shall become a “Lender” for all purposes under the Loan Documents. Each Lender hereby grants to the Agent an irrevocable power of attorney (which power is coupled with an interest) to execute and deliver, on behalf of such Lender as assignor, any assignment agreement necessary to effectuate any assignment of such Lender’s interests hereunder in the circumstances contemplated by this Section.

 

Section 4.2 Payments, Computations; Proceeds of Collateral, etc. (a) Unless otherwise expressly provided in a Loan Document, all payments required to be made by the Borrower pursuant to each Loan Document shall be made by the Borrower to the Agent for the pro rata account of the Secured Parties entitled to receive such payment. All payments shall be made without setoff, deduction or counterclaim not later than 11:00 a.m., Houston, Texas time, on the date due in same day or immediately available funds to such account as the Agent shall specify from time to time by notice to the Borrower. Funds received after that time shall be deemed to have been received by the Agent on the next succeeding Business Day. The Agent shall promptly remit in same day funds to each Secured Party its share, if any, of such payments received by the Agent for the account of such Secured Party. All interest and fees shall be computed on the basis of the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring during the period for which such interest or fee is payable over a year comprised of 360 days. Payments due on other than a Business Day shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and such extension of time shall be included in computing interest and fees in connection with that payment. All payments of the Obligations by the Obligors shall be made without set-off, counterclaim, recoupment or other defense.

 


(b)  After the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Agent may, and upon direction from the Required Lenders, shall, apply all amounts received under the Loan Documents (including from the proceeds of collateral securing the Obligations) or under Applicable Law upon receipt thereof to the Obligations as follows: (i) first, to the payment of all Obligations in respect of fees, expense reimbursements, indemnities and other amounts owing to the Agent, in its capacity as the Agent (including the fees and expenses of counsel to the Agent), (ii) second, after payment in full in cash of the amounts specified in clause (b)(i), to the ratable payment of all interest (including interest accruing (or which would accrue) after the commencement of a proceeding under Debtor Relief Law, whether or not permitted as a claim under such law) and fees owing under the Loan Documents, and all costs and expenses owing to the Secured Parties pursuant to the terms of the Loan Documents, until paid in full in cash, (iii) third, after payment in full in cash of the amounts specified in clauses (b)(i) and (b)(ii), to the ratable payment of the principal amount of the Loans then outstanding and the net credit exposure owing to Secured Parties  under Hedging Agreements, (iv) fourth, after payment in full in cash of the amounts specified in clauses (b)(i) through (b)(iii), to the ratable payment of all other Obligations owing to the Secured Parties, and (v) fifth, after payment in full in cash of the amounts specified in

 



  



-36-







  



 

clauses (b)(i) through (b)(iv), and following the Termination Date, to each applicable Obligor or any other Person lawfully entitled to receive such surplus. For purposes of clause (b)(iii), the “net credit exposure” at any time of any Secured Party with respect to a Hedging Agreement to which such Secured Party is a party shall be determined at such time in accordance with the customary methods of calculating net credit exposure under similar arrangements by the counterparty to such arrangements, taking into account potential interest rate (or, if applicable, currency) movements and the respective termination provisions and notional principal amount and term of such Hedging Agreement.

 

Section 4.3 Sharing of Payments. If any Secured  Party  shall  obtain  any payment or other recovery (whether voluntary, involuntary, by application of setoff or otherwise) on account of any Credit Extension (other than payments pursuant to the terms of Section 4.1) in excess of its pro rata share of payments obtained by all Secured Parties, such Secured Party shall purchase from the other Secured Parties such participations in Credit Extensions made by them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Secured Party to share the excess payment or other recovery ratably (to the extent such other Secured Parties were entitled to receive a portion of such payment or recovery) with each of them; provided that, if all or any portion of the excess payment or other recovery is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Secured Party, the purchase shall be rescinded and each Secured Party that has sold a participation to the purchasing Secured Party shall repay to the purchasing Secured Party the purchase price to the ratable extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such selling Secured Party’s ratable share (according to the proportion of (a) the amount of such selling Secured Party’s required repayment to the purchasing Secured Party to (b) total amount so recovered from the purchasing Secured Party) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Secured Party in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Secured Party purchasing a participation from another Secured Party pursuant to this Section may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including pursuant to Section 4.4) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Secured Party were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. If under any applicable Debtor Relief Law any Secured Party receives a secured claim in lieu of a setoff to which this Section applies, such Secured Party shall, to the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights of the Secured Parties entitled under this Section to share in the benefits of any recovery on such secured claim.

 

Section 4.4   Setoff.  Each Secured Party shall, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Default described in clauses (b) through (d) of Section 8.1.9 or, with the consent of the Required Lenders, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any other Event of Default, have the right to appropriate and apply to the payment of the Obligations owing to it (whether or not then due), and (as security for such Obligations) the Borrower hereby grants to each Secured Party a continuing security interest in, any and all balances, credits, deposits, accounts or moneys of the Borrower then or thereafter maintained with such Secured Party; provided that, any such appropriation and application shall be subject to the provisions of Section 4.3. Each Secured Party agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Agent after any such appropriation and application made by such Secured Party; provided that, the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.  The rights of each

Section 9.2 Funding Reliance, etc.  Unless the Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender by 3:00 p.m. on the Business Day prior to a Borrowing of Loans that such Lender will not make available the amount that would constitute its Percentage of such Borrowing of Loans on the date specified therefor, the Agent may assume that such Lender has made such amount available to the Agent and, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Lender shall not have made such amount available to the Agent, such Lender and the Borrower severally agree to repay the Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date the Agent made such amount available to the Borrower to the date such amount is repaid to the Agent, at the interest rate applicable to the Loans comprising such Borrowing.

 


Section 9.3 Exculpation. Neither the Agent nor any of its directors, officers, employees or agents (each, an “Agent Indemnified Party”) shall be liable to any Secured Party for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it under any Loan Document, or in connection therewith, except for its own willful misconduct or gross negligence (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable judgment), nor responsible for any recitals or warranties herein or therein, nor for the effectiveness, enforceability, validity or due execution of any Loan Document, nor for the creation, perfection or priority of any Liens purported to be created by any of the Loan Documents, or the validity, genuineness, enforceability, existence, value or sufficiency of any collateral security, nor to make any inquiry respecting the performance by any Obligor of its Obligations. Any such inquiry that may be made by the Agent shall not obligate any of them to make any further inquiry or to take any action. The Agent shall be entitled to rely upon advice of counsel concerning legal matters and upon any notice, consent, certificate, statement or writing that it believes to be genuine and to have been presented by a proper Person. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING HEREIN TO  THE  CONTRARY, AND SPECIFICALLY WITH REFERENCE TO THE PROVISIONS OF SECTIONS 9.1, 9.3, 9.5 AND 9.10, IT IS THE INTENTION OF THE PARTIES HERETO THAT EACH AGENT INDEMNIFIED PARTY BE REIMBURSED OR INDEMNIFIED IN THE CASE OF, AND NOT BE LIABLE FOR, ITS OWN NEGLIGENCE (OTHER THAN GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT), REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH

NEGLIGENCE IS SOLE OR CONTRIBUTORY, ACTIVE OR PASSIVE, IMPUTED, JOINT OR TECHNICAL.

 

Section 9.4   Successor.  The Agent may resign as such at any time upon at least 30 days’ prior notice to the Borrower and all Lenders. If the Agent at any time shall resign, the Required Lenders may appoint another Lender as a successor Agent that shall thereupon become the Agent hereunder. If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the retiring Agent’s giving notice of resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent, which shall be one of the Lenders or a commercial banking institution or other Person organized under the laws of the United States (or any State thereof) or a United States branch or agency of a commercial banking institution or other Person, and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $250,000,000; provided that, if, such retiring Agent is unable to find a commercial banking institution or other Person that is willing to accept such appointment and that meets the qualifications set forth in above, the retiring Agent’s resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective and the Lenders shall assume and perform all of the duties of the Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint  a successor as provided for above. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall be entitled to receive from the retiring Agent such documents of transfer and assignment as such successor Agent may reasonably request, and shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under the Loan Documents. After any retiring Agent’s resignation hereunder as the Agent, the provisions of this Article shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was the Agent under the Loan Documents, and Section 10.3 and Section 10.4 shall continue to inure to its benefit.

 

Section 9.5  Credit Extensions by Agent.  The Agent shall have the same rights and powers with respect to (a) the Credit Extensions made by it or any of its Affiliates, and (b) the Notes held by it or any of its Affiliates as any other Lender and may exercise the same as if it were not the Agent. The Agent and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Borrower as if such Agent were not an Agent hereunder.

 

Section 9.6 Credit Decisions. Each Lender acknowledges that it  has, independently of the Agent and each other Lender, and based on such Lender’s review of the financial information of the Borrower, the Loan Documents (the terms and provisions of which being satisfactory to such Lender) and such other documents, information and investigations as such Lender has deemed appropriate, made its own credit decision to extend its Commitments. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently of the Agent and each other Lender, and based on such other documents, information and investigations as it shall deem appropriate at any time, continue to make its own credit decisions as to exercising or not exercising from time to time any rights and privileges available to it under the Loan Documents. In this regard, each Lender acknowledges, agrees and consents that Looper Reed & McGraw, P.C. is acting in this transaction as special counsel to the Agent only, except to the extent otherwise expressly stated in any legal opinion or any Loan Document.  Each other party hereto will consult with its 

 



  



-76-







  



 

own legal counsel to the extent that it deems necessary in connection with the Loan Documents and the matters contemplated therein.

 

Section 9.7 Copies, etc. The Agent shall give prompt notice to each Lender of each notice or request required or permitted to be given to the Agent by the Borrower pursuant to the terms of the Loan Documents (unless concurrently delivered to the Lenders by the Borrower). The Agent will distribute to each Lender each document or instrument received (other than Borrowing Requests and other notices delivered pursuant to Articles 2 and 3) for its account and copies of all other communications received by the Agent from the Borrower for distribution to the Lenders by the Agent in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents.

 

Section 9.8 Reliance by Agent. The Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any certification, notice or other communication (including any thereof by telephone, telecopy, telegram, email or cable) believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by or on behalf of the proper Person, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel, independent accountants and other experts selected by the Agent. As to any matters  not expressly provided for by the Loan Documents, the Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, thereunder in accordance with instructions given by the Required Lenders or all of the Lenders as is required in such circumstance, and such instructions of such Lenders and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding on all Secured Parties. For purposes of applying amounts in accordance with this Section, the Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any Secured Party that has entered into a Hedging Agreement with any Obligor for a determination (which such Secured Party agrees to provide or cause to be provided upon request of the Agent) of the outstanding Obligations owed to such Secured Party under any Hedging Agreement. Unless it has actual knowledge evidenced by way of written notice from any such Secured Party and the Borrower to the contrary, the Agent, in acting in such capacity under the Loan Documents, shall be entitled to assume that no Hedging Agreements or Obligations in respect thereof are in existence or outstanding between  any Secured Party and any Obligor.

 

Section 9.9 Defaults. The Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of a Default unless it has received a written notice from a Secured Party or the Borrower specifying such Default and stating that such notice is a “Notice of Default”. In the event that the Agent receives such a notice of the occurrence of a Default, the Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders. The Agent shall (subject to Section 10.1) take such action with respect to such Default as shall be directed by the Required Lenders; provided that, unless and until the Agent shall have received such directions, the Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interest of the Secured Parties except to the extent that this Agreement expressly requires that such action be taken, or not be taken, only with the consent or upon the authorization of the Required Lenders or all Lenders.

 

Section 9.10  Posting of Approved Electronic Communications.  (a)  In addition to providing the Agent with all originals or copies of all Communications (as defined below) in the manner specified by Section 10.2, the Borrower hereby also agrees, unless directed otherwise by the Agent or unless the electronic mail address referred to below has not been provided by the Agent to the Borrower, that it will, or will cause its Subsidiaries to, provide to the Agent all 

 



  



-77-







  



 

information, documents and other materials that it is obligated to furnish to the Agent pursuant to the Loan Documents or to the Lenders under Section 7.1.1, including all notices, requests, financial statements, financial and other reports, certificates and other information materials (all such communications being referred to herein collectively as “Communications”), by transmitting the Communications in an electronic/soft medium that is properly identified in a format acceptable to the Agent to an electronic mail address as directed by the Agent.

 

(b) The Borrower further agrees that the Agent may make the Communications available to the Lenders by posting the Communications on an electronic transmission system (the “Platform”).

 

(c) THE PLATFORM IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”. THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES DO NOT WARRANT THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE COMMUNICATIONS OR THE ADEQUACY OF THE PLATFORM AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM LIABILITY FOR ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN THE COMMUNICATIONS. NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS OR FREEDOM FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER CODE DEFECTS IS MADE BY THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS OR THE PLATFORM. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO ANY OBLIGOR, ANY LENDER OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER OR NOT BASED ON STRICT LIABILITY AND INCLUDING DIRECT OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, LOSSES OR EXPENSES (WHETHER IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF ANY OBLIGOR’S OR THE AGENT’S TRANSMISSION OF COMMUNICATIONS THROUGH THE INTERNET, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THE LIABILITY OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY IS FOUND IN A FINAL RULING BY A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION TO HAVE RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM SUCH INDEMNIFIED PARTY’S GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT.

 

(d) The Agent agrees that the receipt of the Communications by the Agent at its e-mail address set forth above shall constitute effective delivery of the Communications to the Agent for purposes of the Loan Documents. Each Lender agrees that receipt of notice to it (as provided in the next sentence) specifying that the Communications have been posted to the Platform shall constitute effective delivery of the Communications to such Lender for purposes of the Loan Documents. Each Lender agrees to notify the Agent in writing (including by electronic communication) from time to time of such Lender’s e-mail address to which the foregoing notice may be sent by electronic transmission and that the foregoing notice may be sent to such e-mail address.

 

(e) Nothing herein shall prejudice the right of the Agent or any Lender to give any notice or other communication pursuant to any Loan Document in any other manner specified in such Loan Document.

 

Section 9.11 Proofs of Claim.   The Secured Parties and the Borrower hereby agree that after the occurrence of an Event of Default pursuant to Section 8.1.9, in case of the

 



  



-78-







  



 

pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to any of the Obligors, the Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether Agent shall have made any demand on any of the Obligors) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:

 

(a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans and any other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Agent and other Secured Parties (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders, the Agent and other agents and their agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Agent and other Secured Parties) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and

 

(b) to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; 

 

and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Secured Party to make such payments to the Agent and, in the event that the Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Secured Parties, to pay to the Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due Agent. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Secured Party any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Secured Party or to authorize Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Secured Party in any such proceeding. Further, nothing contained in this Section shall affect or preclude the ability of any Secured Party to (i) file and prove such a claim in the event that the Agent has not acted within ten days prior to any applicable bar date and (ii) require an amendment of the proof of claim to accurately reflect such Secured Party’s outstanding Obligations.

 

Section 9.12 Security Matters; Authority of Agent to Release Collateral. (a) Each Lender and each other Secured Party (by their acceptance of the benefits of  any Collateral) acknowledges and agrees that the Agent has entered into the Security Documents on behalf of itself and the Secured Parties, and the Secured Parties hereby agree to be bound by the terms of such Security Documents, acknowledge receipt of copies of such Security Documents and consent to the rights, powers, remedies, indemnities and exculpations given to the Agent thereunder. All rights, powers and remedies available to the Agent and the Secured Parties with respect to the Collateral, or otherwise pursuant to the Security Documents, shall be subject to the provisions of such Security Documents. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the terms and provisions of such Security Documents, the terms and provisions of such Security Documents shall govern and control except that this Agreement shall govern and control the rights, powers, duties, immunities and indemnities of the Agent. The Agent may, without the consent of the Lenders, (i) amend, supplement, restate or otherwise modify the Control Agreement and other Security Documents in order to cure any defect or inconsistency therein, to make any change not inconsistent with the 

 



  



-79-







  



 

provisions thereof or to cure any ambiguity or correct any mistake therein, provided that such amendment, supplement, restatement or modification does not adversely affect the interests of any Secured Parties and (ii) agree to such replacements, updates and supplements of any exhibit or schedule to a Control Agreement and the exhibits and schedules to the Security Documents as the Agent deems reasonable, including without limitation to update any supplemental information, add additional accounts or replace or terminate existing accounts; provided that clauses (i) and (ii) above shall not be construed to permit the Agent to agree to changes of the type described in clauses (a) through (g) of Section 10.1 unless the Agent shall have obtained the requisite consents as specified in Section 10.1.

 

(b) Each Lender and other Secured Party (by their acceptance of the benefits of any Collateral) hereby authorizes the Agent to release any collateral that is permitted to be sold or released pursuant to the terms of the Loan Documents. Each Lender and other Secured Party hereby authorizes the Agent to execute and deliver to the Borrower, at the Borrower’s sole cost and expense, any and all releases of Liens, termination statements, assignments or other documents reasonably requested by the Borrower in connection with any sale or other Disposition of Property to the extent such sale or other Disposition is permitted by the terms of this Agreement or is otherwise authorized by the terms of the Loan Documents.

 

(c) Any Secured Party may assign or otherwise transfer (in whole or in part) its interest pursuant to any Hedging Agreement with the Borrower (or a Subsidiary thereof if permitted by Section 7.2.19) to an Approved Counterparty that is or becomes a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender at the time of such transfer and such Hedging Agreement shall remain secured by the Loan Documents to the same extent that such Hedging Agreement was secured hereunder when the original Secured Party was the counterparty to such Hedging Agreement.

 

Section 9.13 Agents Responsibility. Without limiting the foregoing, the Agent shall not have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any other Lender or any Obligor. Each Lender acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not rely, on the Agent in deciding to enter into this Agreement and each other Loan Document to which it is a party or in taking or not taking action hereunder or thereunder. No Lender shall have any fiduciary obligation toward the Borrower or any other Obligor with respect to any Loan Document or the transactions contemplated thereby.

(c) reduce the principal amount of or reduce the rate of interest on any Lender’s Loan, reduce any fees described in Article 3 payable to any Lender or extend the date on which principal, interest or fees are payable in respect of such Lender’s Loans, in each case without the consent of such Lender (provided that, the vote of Required Lenders shall be sufficient to waive the payment, or reduce the increased portion, of interest accruing under Section 3.2.1 during the continuation of an Event of Default);

No failure or delay on the part of any Secured Party in exercising any power or right under any Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power or right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other power or right. No notice to or demand on any Obligor in any case shall entitle it to any notice or demand in similar or other circumstances. No waiver or approval by any Secured Party under any Loan Document shall, except as may be otherwise stated in such waiver or approval, be applicable to subsequent transactions. No waiver or approval hereunder shall require any similar or dissimilar waiver or approval thereafter to be granted hereunder.

 

Section 10.2 Notices; Time.

In consideration of the execution and delivery of this Agreement by each Secured Party, the Borrower hereby indemnifies, exonerates and holds each Secured Party and each of their respective officers, directors, employees and agents (collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”) free and harmless from and against any and all actions, causes of action, suits, losses, costs, liabilities and damages, and expenses incurred in connection therewith (irrespective of whether any such Indemnified Party is a party to the action for which

 



  



-82-







  



 

indemnification hereunder is sought), including reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements, whether incurred in connection with actions between or among the parties hereto or the parties hereto and third parties (collectively, the “Indemnified Liabilities”), incurred by the Indemnified Parties or any of them as a result of, or arising out of, or relating to

 

(a) any transaction financed or to be financed in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, with the proceeds of any Credit Extension, including all Indemnified Liabilities arising in connection with the Acquisition;

 

(b) the entering into and performance of any Loan Document by any of the Indemnified Parties;

 

(c) the Loan Documents, the Credit Extensions and the extension of the Commitments, the failure of any Obligor to comply with the terms of the Loan Documents or Applicable Law, the inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of any Obligor set forth in the Loan Documents or in a certificate, instrument or document delivered in connection therewith, and the use by any Obligor of the proceeds of any Credit Extension;

 

(d) any investigation, litigation or proceeding related to any acquisition or proposed acquisition by any Obligor or any Subsidiary thereof of all or any portion of the Capital Securities or assets of any Person, whether or not an Indemnified Party is party thereto;

 

(e) any investigation, litigation or proceeding related to any environmental cleanup, audit, compliance or other matter relating to the protection of the environment or the Release by any Obligor or any Subsidiary thereof of any Hazardous Material;

 

(f) the presence on or under, or the escape, seepage, leakage, spillage, discharge, emission, discharging or releases from, any real property owned or operated by any Obligor or any Subsidiary thereof of any Hazardous Material (including any losses, liabilities, damages, injuries, costs, expenses or claims asserted or arising under any Environmental Law), regardless of whether caused by, or within the control of, such Obligor or Subsidiary; or

 

(g) each Lender’s Environmental Liability (the indemnification herein shall survive repayment of the Obligations and any transfer of the property of any Obligor or its Subsidiaries by foreclosure or by a deed in lieu of foreclosure for any Lender’s Environmental Liability, regardless of whether caused by, or within the control of, such Obligor or such Subsidiary);

 

provided that the Borrower shall not be required to indemnify any Indemnified Party to the extent the applicable Indemnified Liability arises by reason of such Indemnified Party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable judgment). Each Obligor and its successors and assigns hereby waive, release and agree not to make any claim or bring any cost recovery action against, any Indemnified Party under CERCLA or any state, provincial or foreign equivalent, or any similar law now existing or hereafter enacted, except for liabilities arising from an Indemnified Party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable judgment).  It is expressly understood and agreed that to the extent that

 



  



-83-







  



 

any Indemnified Party is strictly liable under any Environmental Laws, each Obligor’s obligation to such Indemnified Party under this indemnity shall likewise be without regard to fault on the part of any Obligor with respect to the violation or condition that results in liability of an Indemnified Party. If and to the extent that the foregoing undertaking may be unenforceable for any reason, each Obligor agrees to make the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of each of the Indemnified Liabilities that is permissible under Applicable Law. To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the Obligors shall not assert, and hereby waive, any claim against any Indemnified Party, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof. All amounts payable to the Indemnified Parties for the Indemnified Liabilities hereunder shall be payable upon written demand therefor. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING HEREIN TO THE CONTRARY, IT IS THE INTENTION OF THE PARTIES HERETO THAT EACH INDEMNIFIED PARTY BE INDEMNIFIED IN THE CASE OF ITS OWN NEGLIGENCE (OTHER THAN GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT), REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH NEGLIGENCE IS SOLE OR CONTRIBUTORY, ACTIVE OR PASSIVE, IMPUTED, JOINT OR TECHNICAL.

 

Section 10.5 Survival. The obligations of the Borrower under Sections 4.1, 10.3 and 10.4 and the obligations of the Lenders under Section 9.1 shall, in each case, survive any assignment from one Lender to another until the occurrence of the Termination Date. The representations and warranties, covenants and agreements made by each Obligor in each Loan Document shall survive the execution and delivery of such Loan Document. To the extent that any payment of the Obligations (including any application of proceeds of Collateral to the Obligations) is invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be repaid to a trustee, debtor in possession, receiver or other Person under any Debtor Relief Law or equitable cause, then to such extent, the Obligations so satisfied shall be revived and continue as if such payment or proceeds had not been received or applied and the Agent’s and Lenders’ Liens, rights, powers and remedies under this Agreement and each Loan Document shall continue in full force and effect. In such event, each Loan Document shall be automatically reinstated and the Borrower shall take such action as may be requested by the Lenders to effect such reinstatement.

 

Section 10.6 Severability. Any provision of any Loan Document that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such provision and such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions of such Loan Document or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.

 

Section 10.7 Headings. The various headings of each Loan  Document  are inserted for convenience only and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of such Loan Document or any provisions thereof.

 

Section 10.8 Execution  in Counterparts, Effectiveness, etc. This Agreement may be executed by the parties hereto in several counterparts, each of which shall be an original (whether such counterpart is originally executed or an electronic copy of an original and each 

 



  



-84-







  



 

party hereto expressly waives its rights to receive originally executed documents other than with respect to any Notes) and all of which shall constitute together but one and the same agreement. This Agreement shall become effective when counterparts hereof executed on behalf of the Borrower, the Agent and each Lender (or notice thereof satisfactory to the Agent), shall have been received by the Agent. The parties hereto agree that delivery of a counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement and each other Loan Document by facsimile or electronic transmission shall be effective as delivery of an original executed counterpart of this Agreement or such other Loan Document.

 


Section 10.9 Governing Law. EACH LOAN DOCUMENT (EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN A LOAN DOCUMENT) WILL EACH BE DEEMED TO BE A CONTRACT MADE UNDER AND GOVERNED BY THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS (WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CHOICE OF LAW RULES THAT MAY DIRECT THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION).

 

Section 10.10 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns; provided that, the Borrower may not assign or transfer its rights or obligations hereunder without the consent of all Lenders.

(i) the aggregate amount of the Commitments (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder), principal outstanding balance of the Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Lender Assignment Agreement with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Agent) shall not be less than $1,000,000, unless (A) the Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); (B) such assignment is an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender’s Commitments and Loans at the time owing to it, (C) such assignment is an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to a Lender, or (D) such assignment is to one or more Eligible Assignees managed by an Affiliate of such Eligible Assignee(s) and the aggregate amount of such assignments is not less than $1,000,000;

 

(ii) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loans and/or the Commitments assigned; and

(iii) the parties to each assignment shall (A) electronically execute and deliver to the Agent a Lender Assignment Agreement acceptable to the Agent or (B) with the consent of the Agent, manually execute and deliver to the Agent a Lender Assignment Agreement, together with, in either case, a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 (which fee may be waived or reduced in the sole discretion of the Agent) and if the Eligible Assignee is not a Lender, administrative details information with respect to such Eligible Assignee and applicable tax forms.

 

(b) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Agent pursuant to clause (c), from and after the effective date specified in each Lender Assignment Agreement, (i) the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Lender Assignment Agreement, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and (ii) the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Lender Assignment Agreement, subject to Section 10.5, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of a Lender Assignment Agreement covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto, but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of any provisions of this Agreement that by their terms survive the termination of this Agreement). If the consent of the Borrower to an assignment or to an Eligible Assignee is required hereunder (including a consent to an assignment that does not meet the minimum assignment thresholds specified in this Section), the Borrower shall be deemed to have given its consent five (5) Business Days after the date notice thereof has been delivered by the assigning  Lender (through the Agent) unless such consent is expressly refused by the Borrower prior to such fifth Business Day.

 

(c) The Agent shall record each assignment made in accordance with this Section 10.11 in the Register pursuant to Section 2.5 and periodically give the Borrower notice of such assignments. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

 

(d) Any Lender may, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments and/or Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver with respect to any of the items set forth in clauses (a) through (d) or (f) of Section 10.1, in each case except as otherwise specifically provided in a Loan Document. Subject to clause (e), the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 4.1, 7.1.1, 10.3 and 10.4 to the same

extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to clause (b). To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 4.4 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 4.3 as though it were a Lender. Each Lender shall, as agent of the Borrower solely for the purpose of this Section, record in book entries maintained by such Lender the name and the amount of the participating interest of each Participant entitled to receive payments in respect of any participating interests sold pursuant to this Section.

 

(e) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 4.1, 10.3 and 10.4, as of the time of the sale of such participation, than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower’s prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Non-U.S. Credit Party if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 4.1 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with the requirements set forth in Section 4.1 as though it were a Lender. In addition, if at the time of the sale of such participation, any greater Taxes subject to payment under Section 4.1 would apply to the Participant than applied to the applicable Lender, then such Participant shall not be entitled to any payment under Section 4.1 with respect to the portion of such Taxes as exceeds the Taxes applicable to the Lender at the time of the sale of the participation unless the Participant’s request for the Borrower’s prior written consent for the Participation described in the first sentence of this clause states that such greater Taxes would be applicable to such Participant, it being understood that the Participant shall be entitled to additional payments under Section 4.1 to the extent such Lender selling the participation would be entitled to any payment resulting from a Change in Law occurring after the time the participation was sold. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the “Participant Register”). The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.

 

(f) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

 

Section 10.12 Other Transactions. Nothing contained herein shall preclude the Agent or any Lender from engaging in any transaction, in addition to those contemplated by the Loan Documents, with the Borrower or any of its Affiliates in which the Borrower or such Affiliate is not restricted hereby from engaging with any other Person.

TO THE EXTENT THAT THE BORROWER HAS OR HEREAFTER MAY ACQUIRE ANY IMMUNITY FROM JURISDICTION OF ANY COURT OR FROM ANY LEGAL PROCESS (WHETHER THROUGH SERVICE OR NOTICE, ATTACHMENT PRIOR TO JUDGMENT, ATTACHMENT IN AID OF EXECUTION OR OTHERWISE) WITH RESPECT TO ITSELF OR ITS PROPERTY, THE BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW SUCH IMMUNITY IN RESPECT OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE LOAN DOCUMENTS.

 


Section 10.14 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE BORROWER, THE AGENT AND THE LENDERS HEREBY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF, OR IN ANY WAY RELATING TO: (A) THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, OR (B) ANY OTHER PRESENT OR FUTURE INSTRUMENT OR AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE BORROWER AND ANY OF THE LENDERS, OR (C) ANY CONDUCT, ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF THE BORROWER, THE AGENT OR ANY OF THE LENDERS OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE MANAGERS, MEMBERS, PARTNERS, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, ATTORNEYS OR ANY OTHER PERSONS AFFILIATED WITH THE BORROWER, THE AGENT OR ANY OF THE LENDERS; IN EACH OF THE FOREGOING CASES, WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT OR OTHERWISE. EACH OF THE BORROWER, THE AGENT AND THE LENDERS ALSO WAIVES ANY BOND OR SURETY OR SECURITY UPON SUCH BOND WHICH MIGHT, BUT FOR THIS WAIVER, BE REQUIRED OF THE AGENT OR ANY OF THE LENDERS. THE SCOPE OF THIS WAIVER IS INTENDED TO BE ALL-ENCOMPASSING OF ANY AND ALL DISPUTES THAT MAY BE FILED IN ANY COURT AND THAT RELATE TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING

WITHOUT LIMITATION, CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS, BREACH OF DUTY CLAIMS, AND ALL OTHER COMMON LAW AND STATUTORY CLAIMS.

THE WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE LOAN DOCUMENTS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, OR TO ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS OR AGREEMENTS RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY SUCH LOAN DOCUMENTS. EACH OF THE BORROWER, THE AGENT AND THE LENDERS FURTHER WARRANTS AND REPRESENTS THAT IT HAS REVIEWED THIS WAIVER WITH ITS LEGAL COUNSEL, AND THAT IT KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES ITS JURY TRIAL RIGHTS FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL COUNSEL. IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE FILED AS A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A TRIAL BY THE COURT.

 

Section 10.15 Confidentiality. (a) Subject to the provisions of clause (b) of this Section, each Lender agrees that it will follow its customary procedures in an effort not to disclose without the prior consent of the Borrower (other than to its employees, agents, auditors, advisors or counsel or to another Lender if the Lender or such Lender’s holding or parent company in its sole discretion determines that any such party should have access to such information, provided such Persons shall be subject to the provisions of this Section to the same extent as such Lender) any information that is now or in the future furnished pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, provided that any Lender may disclose any such information (i) as has become generally available to the public other than by virtue of a breach of this clause by the respective Lender or any other Person to whom such Lender has provided such information as permitted by this Section, (ii) as may be required or appropriate in any report, statement or testimony or other disclosure submitted to any municipal, state, provincial or federal regulatory body having or claiming to have jurisdiction over such Lender or similar organizations (whether in the United States or elsewhere) or their successors, (iii) as may be required or appropriate in respect to any summons or subpoena or in connection with any litigation, (iv) in order to comply with any law, order, regulation or ruling applicable to such Lender, (v) to the Agent, (vi) to any pledgee referred to in clause (f) of Section 10.11 or any prospective or actual transferee or participant in connection with any contemplated transfer or participation of any of the Notes or Commitments or any interest therein by such Lender, provided that such prospective transferee agrees to be bound by the confidentiality provisions contained in this Section, (vii) to any direct or indirect contractual counterparty in swap agreements or such contractual counterparty’s professional advisor (so long as such contractual counterparty or professional advisor to such contractual counterparty agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Section) and (viii) to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or any similar organization or any nationally recognized rating agency that requires access to information about a Lender’s investment portfolio in connection with ratings issued with respect to such Lender.

(b) The Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees that each Lender may share with any of its Affiliates, and such Affiliates may share with such Lender, any information related to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, provided such Persons shall be subject to the provisions of this Section to the same extent as such Lender.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraphs of this Section, any party to this Agreement (and each Affiliate, director, officer, employee, agent or representative of the foregoing or such Affiliate) may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of the transactions contemplated herein and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to such party relating to such tax treatment or tax structure.

Section 10.16  Counsel  Representation.  THE BORROWER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT IT HAS BEEN REPRESENTED BY COMPETENT COUNSEL IN THE NEGOTIATION OF THIS AGREEMENT, AND THAT ANY RULE OR CONSTRUCTION OF LAW ENABLING THE BORROWER TO ASSERT THAT ANY AMBIGUITIES OR INCONSISTENCIES IN THE DRAFTING OR PREPARATION OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT SHOULD DIMINISH ANY RIGHTS OR REMEDIES OF THE AGENT OR THE OTHER SECURED PARTIES ARE HEREBY WAIVED BY THE BORROWER.

THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTIES.

 


Section 10.18 Maximum Interest. It is the intention of the parties hereto to conform strictly to applicable usury laws and, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Obligations of the Borrower to each Lender under this Agreement shall be subject to the limitation that payments of interest shall not be required to the extent that receipt thereof would be contrary to provisions of law applicable to such Lender limiting rates of interest that may be charged or collected by such Lender. Accordingly, if the transactions contemplated hereby would be usurious under Applicable Law (including the Federal and state laws of the United States of America, or of any other jurisdiction whose laws may be mandatorily applicable) with respect to a Lender, then, in that event, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this

Agreement, it is agreed as follows: (a) the provisions of this Section 10.18 shall govern and control; (b) the aggregate of all consideration that constitutes interest under Applicable Law that is contracted for, charged or received under this Agreement, or under any other Loan Document or otherwise in connection with this Agreement by such Lender shall under no circumstances exceed the Highest Lawful Rate with respect to such Lender, and any excess shall be credited to the Borrower by such Lender (or, if such consideration shall have been paid in full, such excess promptly refunded to the Borrower); (c) all sums paid, or agreed to be paid, to such Lender for the use, forbearance and detention of the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender hereunder shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread throughout the full term of such indebtedness until payment in full so that the actual rate of interest is uniform throughout the full term thereof; and (d) if at any time the interest provided pursuant to Section 3.2, together with any other fees and expenses payable pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and deemed interest under Applicable Law, exceeds that amount that would have accrued at the Highest Lawful Rate, then the amount of interest and any such fees to accrue to such Lender pursuant to this Agreement shall be limited, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, to that amount that would have accrued at the Highest Lawful Rate, but any subsequent reductions, as applicable, shall not reduce the interest to accrue to such Lender pursuant to this Agreement below the Highest Lawful Rate until the total amount of interest accrued pursuant to this Agreement and such fees deemed to be interest equals the amount of interest that would have accrued to such Lender if a rate per annum equal to the interest provided pursuant to Section 3.2 had at all times been in effect, plus the amount of fees that would have been received but  for  the  effect  of  this Section 10.18. In regards to the foregoing, in determining whether or not the interest paid or payable with respect to any Indebtedness of the Borrower to the Lenders, under any specified contingency, exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate, the Borrower and the Lenders shall, to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, (i) characterize any non-principal payment as an expense, fee or premium rather than as interest, (ii) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, (iii) amortize, prorate, allocate and spread the total amount of interest throughout the entire contemplated term of such Indebtedness so that interest thereon does not exceed the maximum amount permitted by Applicable Law, and (iv) allocate interest between portions of such Indebtedness, to the end that no such portion shall bear interest at a rate greater than that permitted by Applicable Law. The right to accelerate the maturity of the this Loans under this Agreement and the other Obligations does not include the right to accelerate any interest which has not otherwise accrued on the date of such acceleration, and the Lenders do not intend to charge or receive any unearned interest in the event of acceleration. In the event Applicable Law provides for an interest ceiling under Section 303 of the Texas Finance Code, that ceiling shall be the weekly ceiling.

Obligations of the Borrower (or a Subsidiary thereof if permitted by Section 7.2.19) under any qualifying Hedging Agreement with any such Approved Counterparty from realization of any Collateral shall be subject to the terms of the Security Documents.

 

Section 10.20 PATRIOT Act. Each Lender hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the PATRIOT Act, it may be required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower, which information includes the name  and address of the Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender to identify the Borrower in accordance with the PATRIOT Act. The Borrower shall, promptly following a request by any Lender, provide all documentation and other information that such  Lender requests in order to comply with any of its ongoing obligations under applicable “know your customer” and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the PATRIOT Act.
