Section 9.    Performance Awards.    The Committee is authorized to grant Performance Awards to Participants with the following terms and conditions and with such additional terms and conditions, in either case not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan, as the Committee shall determine:
 
(a)   Performance Awards may be denominated as a cash amount, number of Shares or units or a combination thereof and are Awards which may be earned upon achievement or satisfaction of performance conditions specified by the Committee. In addition, the Committee may specify that any other Award shall constitute a Performance Award by conditioning the grant to a Participant or the right of a Participant to exercise the Award or have it settled, and the timing thereof, upon achievement or satisfaction of such performance conditions as may be specified by the Committee. The Committee may use such business criteria and other measures of performance as it may deem appropriate in establishing any performance conditions. Subject to the terms of the Plan, the performance goals to be achieved during any Performance Period, the length of any Performance Period, the amount of any Performance Award granted and the amount of any payment or transfer to be made pursuant to any Performance Award shall be determined by the Committee.
 
(b)   Every Performance Award shall include, if the Committee intends that such Award should constitute Section 162(m) Compensation, a pre-established formula, such that payment, retention or vesting of the Award is subject to the achievement during a Performance Period or Performance Periods, as determined by the Committee, of a level or levels of, or increases in, in each case as determined by the Committee, one or more of the following performance measures with respect to the Company: captured prospects, licenses or leases acquired, contracts executed, operated prospects matured to drill ready, drilling programs commenced, wells commenced, successful wells, drillable prospects, exploratory and appraisal drilling performance, capabilities and critical path items established, operating or total budget, cash management, liquidity measurements, capital raised, captured net risked resource potential, acquisition cost efficiency, central lease sale position, acquisitions of oil and gas interests, measurements of proved, probable or possible reserves, measurements of resources, finding and development costs, overhead costs, general and administration expense, market price of a Share, cash flow, reserve value, net asset value, earnings, net income, value or number of asset dispositions, operating income, cash from operations, revenue, margin, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), EBITDAX (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and exploration expense), net capital employed, return on assets, stockholder return, reserve replacement, return on equity, return on capital employed, production, assets, unit volume, sales, market share, safety and environmental performance objectives, accidents, injuries or fatalities, or strategic business criteria consisting of one or more objectives based on meeting specified goals relating to acquisitions or divestitures, each as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, where applicable, as consistently applied by the Company. Performance criteria may be measured on an absolute (e.g., plan or budget) or relative basis. Relative performance may be measured against a
 






 
group of peer companies, a financial market index or other acceptable objective and quantifiable indices. Except in the case of an award intended to qualify as Section 162(m) Compensation, if the Committee determines that a change in the business, operations, corporate structure or capital structure of the Company, or the manner in which the Company conducts its business, or other events or circumstances render the performance objectives unsuitable, the Committee may modify the performance objectives or the related minimum acceptable level of achievement, in whole or in part, as the Committee deems appropriate and equitable. Performance measures may vary from Performance Award to Performance Award, respectively, and from Participant to Participant, and may be established on a stand-alone basis, in tandem or in the alternative. The Committee shall have the power to impose such other restrictions on Awards subject to this Section 9(b) as it may deem necessary or appropriate to ensure that such Awards satisfy all requirements for Section 162(m) Compensation. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, the Committee shall not be authorized to increase the amount payable under any Award to which this Section 9(b) applies upon attainment of such pre-established formula.
 
(c)   Settlement of Performance Awards shall be in cash, Shares, other Awards, other property, net settlement, or any combination thereof, in the discretion of the Committee. The Committee shall specify the circumstances in which, and the extent to which, Performance Awards shall be paid or forfeited in the event of a Participants Termination of Service.
 
(d)   Performance Awards will be settled only after the end of the relevant Performance Period. The Committee may, in its discretion, increase or reduce the amount of a settlement otherwise to be made in connection with a Performance Award but may not exercise discretion to increase any amount payable to a Covered Employee in respect of a Performance Award intended to qualify as Section 162(m) Compensation. Any settlement that changes the form of payment from that originally specified shall be implemented in a manner such that the Performance Award and other related Awards do not, solely for that reason, fail to qualify as Section 162(m) Compensation.
 
(e)   The maximum dollar value that may be earned by any Participant for each 12 months in a Performance Period with respect to Performance Awards that are intended to constitute Section 162(m) Compensation and are denominated in cash is $20 million. If an Award is cancelled, the cancelled Award shall continue to be counted toward the applicable limitation set forth in this Section 9(e).
 
Section 10.    Other Stock-Based Awards.    The Committee is authorized, subject to limitations under applicable law, to grant to Participants such other Awards that may be denominated or payable in, valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on, or related to, Shares or factors that may influence the value of Shares, including convertible or exchangeable debt securities, other rights convertible or exchangeable into Shares, purchase rights for Shares, Awards with value and payment contingent upon performance of the Company or business units thereof or any other factors designated by the Committee. The Committee shall determine the terms and conditions of such Awards. Shares delivered pursuant to an Award in the nature of a purchase right granted under this Section 10 shall be purchased for such consideration, paid for at such times, by such methods and in such forms, including cash, Shares, other Awards, other property, or any combination thereof, as the Committee shall determine. Cash awards, as an element of or supplement to any other Award under the Plan, may also be granted pursuant to this Section 10.
 
Section 11.    Effect of Termination of Service or a Change in Control on Awards.
 
(a)   The Committee may provide, by rule or regulation or in any Award Document, or may determine in any individual case, the circumstances in which, and the extent to which, an Award may be exercised, settled, vested, paid or forfeited in the event of a Participants Termination of Service prior to the end of a Performance Period or exercise or settlement of such Award.
 






 
(b)   The Committee may set forth the treatment of an Award upon a Change in Control in the applicable Award Document.
 
(c)   In the case of an Option or SAR Award, except as otherwise provided in the applicable Award Document, upon a Change in Control, a merger or consolidation involving the Company or any other event with respect to which the Committee deems it appropriate, the Committee may cause such Award to be canceled in consideration of (i) the full acceleration of such Award and either (A) a period of at least ten days prior to the effective date of such Change in Control to exercise the Award or (B) a payment in cash or other consideration to the Participant who holds such Award in an amount equal to the Intrinsic Value of such Award (which may be equal to but not less than zero), which, if in excess of zero, shall be payable upon the effective date of such Change in Control, merger, consolidation or other event or (ii) a substitute award (which immediately upon grant shall have an Intrinsic Value equal to the Intrinsic Value of such Award or the value otherwise permitted under Section 409A of the Code).

(b)   Awards may, in the discretion of the Committee, be granted either alone or in addition to or in tandem with any other Award or any award granted under any other plan of the Company. Awards granted in addition to or in tandem with other Awards, or in addition to or in tandem with awards granted under any other plan of the Company, may be granted either at the same time as or at a different time from the grant of such other Awards or awards.
 
(c)   Subject to the terms of the Plan, payments or transfers to be made by the Company upon the grant, exercise or settlement of an Award may be made in the form of cash, Shares, other Awards, other property, net settlement, or any combination thereof, as determined by the Committee in its discretion at the time of grant, and may be made in a single payment or transfer, in installments or on a deferred basis, in each case in accordance with rules and procedures established by the Committee. Such rules and procedures may include provisions for the payment or crediting of reasonable interest on installment or deferred payments or the grant or crediting of dividend equivalents in respect of installment or deferred payments.
 
(d)   Except as may be permitted by the Committee (except with respect to Incentive Stock Options) or as specifically provided in an Award Document, (i) no Award and no right under any Award shall be assignable, alienable, saleable or transferable by a Participant otherwise than by will or pursuant to Section 12(e) and (ii) during a Participants lifetime, each Award, and each right under any Award, shall be exercisable only by the Participant or, if permissible under applicable law, by the Participants guardian or legal representative. The provisions of this Section 12(d) shall not apply to any Award that has been fully exercised or settled, as the case may be, and shall not preclude forfeiture of an Award in accordance with the terms thereof.
 
(e)   A Participant may designate a Beneficiary or change a previous Beneficiary designation at such times prescribed by the Committee by using forms and following procedures approved or accepted by the Committee for that purpose.
 
(f)    All certificates for Shares and/or other securities delivered under the Plan pursuant to any Award or the exercise thereof shall be subject to such stop transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee may deem advisable under the Plan or the rules, regulations and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, any stock market or exchange upon which such Shares or other securities are then quoted, traded or listed, and any applicable securities laws, and the Committee may cause a legend or legends to be put on any such certificates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions.
 






 
(g)   The Committee may impose restrictions on any Award with respect to non-competition, confidentiality and other restrictive covenants as it deems necessary or appropriate in its sole discretion.
 
Section 13.    Amendments and Termination.
 
(a)    Amendment or Termination of Plan.    Except to the extent prohibited by applicable law and unless otherwise expressly provided in an Award Document or in the Plan, the Board may amend, alter, suspend, discontinue or terminate the Plan or any portion thereof at any time; provided, however, that no such amendment, alteration, suspension, discontinuation or termination shall be made without (i) shareholder approval if such approval is required by applicable law or the rules of the stock market or exchange, if any, on which the Shares are principally quoted or traded or (ii) the consent of the affected Participant, if such action would materially adversely affect the rights of such Participant under any outstanding Award, except (x) to the extent any such amendment, alteration, suspension, discontinuance or termination is made to cause the Plan to comply with applicable law, stock market or exchange rules and regulations or accounting or tax rules and regulations or (y) to impose any clawback or recoupment provisions on any Awards in accordance with Section 4(d) of the Plan. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, the Committee may amend the Plan, or create sub-plans, in such manner as may be necessary to enable the Plan to achieve its stated purposes in any jurisdiction in a tax-efficient manner and in compliance with local rules and regulations. The Committee may correct any defect, supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or any Award in the manner and to the extent it shall deem desirable to carry the Plan into effect.
 
(b)    Terms of Awards.    The Committee may waive any conditions or rights under, amend any terms of, or amend, alter, suspend, discontinue or terminate any Award theretofore granted, prospectively or retroactively, without the consent of any relevant Participant or holder or Beneficiary of an Award; provided, however, that no such action shall materially adversely affect the rights of any affected Participant or holder or Beneficiary under any Award theretofore granted under the Plan, except (x) to the extent any such action is made to cause the Plan to comply with applicable law, stock market or exchange rules and regulations or accounting or tax rules and regulations, or (y) to impose any clawback or recoupment provisions on any Awards in accordance with Section 4(d) of the Plan; and provided further, that the Committees authority under this Section 13(b) is limited in the case of Awards subject to Section 9(b), as provided in Section 9(b).
 
(c)    No Repricing.    Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as provided in Section 5(c), no action shall directly or indirectly, through cancellation and regrant or any other method, reduce, or have the effect of reducing, the exercise price of any Award established at the time of grant thereof without approval of the Companys shareholders.
 
Section 14.    Miscellaneous.
 
(a)   No employee, Participant or other person shall have any claim to be granted any Award under the Plan, and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of employees, Participants or holders or Beneficiaries of Awards under the Plan. The terms and conditions of Awards need not be the same with respect to each recipient. Any Award granted under the Plan shall be a one-time Award that does not constitute a promise of future grants. The Company, in its sole discretion, maintains the right to make available future grants under the Plan.
 
(b)   The grant of an Award shall not be construed as giving a Participant the right to be retained in the employ of, or to continue to provide services to, the Company or any Affiliate. Further, the Company or the applicable Affiliate may at any time dismiss a Participant, free from any liability, or any claim under the Plan, unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or in any
 






 
Award Document or in any other agreement binding the parties. The receipt of any Award under the Plan is not intended to confer any rights on the receiving Participant except as set forth in the applicable Award Document.
 
(c)   Nothing contained in the Plan shall prevent the Company from adopting or continuing in effect other or additional compensation arrangements, and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases.
 
(d)   The Company shall be authorized to withhold from any Award granted or any payment due or transfer made under any Award or under the Plan or from any compensation or other amount owing to a Participant the amount (in cash, Shares, other Awards, other property, net settlement, or any combination thereof) of applicable withholding taxes due in respect of an Award, its exercise or settlement or any payment or transfer under such Award or under the Plan and to take such other action (including providing for elective payment of such amounts in cash or Shares by the Participant) as may be necessary in the opinion of the Company to satisfy all obligations for the payment of such taxes; provided that if the Committee allows the withholding or surrender of Shares to satisfy a Participants tax withholding obligations, the aggregate Fair Market Value of such withheld or surrendered Shares shall not exceed the minimum statutory withholding amount for federal and state tax purposes, including payroll taxes.
 
(e)   If any provision of the Plan or any Award Document is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, or as to any person or Award, or would disqualify the Plan or any Award under any law deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to applicable laws, or if it cannot be so construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the Committee, materially altering the intent of the Plan or the Award Document, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction, person or Award, and the remainder of the Plan and any such Award Document shall remain in full force and effect.
 
(f)    Neither the Plan nor any Award shall create or be construed to create a trust or separate fund of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between the Company and a Participant or any other person. To the extent that any person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company pursuant to an Award, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Company.
 
(g)   No fractional Shares shall be issued or delivered pursuant to the Plan or any Award, and the Committee shall determine whether cash or other securities shall be paid or transferred in lieu of any fractional Shares, or whether such fractional Shares or any rights thereto shall be canceled, terminated or otherwise eliminated.
 
Section 15.    Effective Date of the Plan.    The Plan shall be effective as of the Effective Date.
 
Section 16.    Term of the Plan.    No Award shall be granted under the Plan after the earliest to occur of (i) the tenth year anniversary of the Effective Date, (ii) the maximum number of Shares available for issuance under the Plan have been issued or (iii) the Board terminates the Plan in accordance with Section 13(a). However, unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or in an applicable Award Document, any Award theretofore granted may extend beyond such date, and the authority of the Committee to amend, alter, adjust, suspend, discontinue or terminate any such Award, or to waive any conditions or rights under any such Award, and the authority of the Board to amend the Plan, shall extend beyond such date.
 
Section 17.    Section 409A of the Code.    With respect to Awards subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Plan is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and the provisions of the Plan and any Award Document shall be interpreted in a manner that satisfies the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and the Plan shall be operated accordingly. If any provision
 






 
of the Plan or any term or condition of any Award would otherwise frustrate or conflict with this intent, the provision, term or condition will be interpreted and deemed amended so as to avoid this conflict. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, the Company makes no representations or warranty and shall have no liability to the Participant or any other person if any provisions or payments, compensation or other benefits under the Plan are determined to constitute nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code but do not satisfy the provisions thereof.
 
Section 18.    Governing Law.    The Plan and each Award Document shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without application of the conflicts of law principles thereof.
