Lilis and TRW are each, individually, a “Party” and collectively, the “Parties.”

The parties further acknowledge that from and after the date hereof, neither Lilis nor TRW shall have any rights, obligations, or liabilities under or relating to the Investment Banking Agreement, except for Section 4 (Additional Covenants and Undertakings), Section 7 (Confidential Information), Section 8 (Ownership of Proprietary Information), and Section 9 (Indemnification) of the Investment Banking Agreement, which shall survive termination of the Investment Banking Agreement.
