Asset - For purposes of the Base Purchase Price adjustment described in Articles 7 and 8, a particular Asset will be determined pursuant to
the Asset description and value set forth on Exhibit C.

Additional Interests - During the Due Diligence Period, Buyer shall notify Seller in writing if Buyer determines that Seller has (i) a lesser working
interest (without a proportionate decrease in the corresponding net revenue interest) with respect to all or any part of the Assets than shown on Exhibit C, or (ii) a greater net revenue interest with respect to all or any

   -19-









 
7.4.1
Liquidated Charges - If the adjustment is based upon a lien, encumbrance, or other charge upon an Asset which is liquidated in amount or which can be estimated
with reasonable certainty, then the adjustment shall be the sum necessary to be paid to the obligee to remove the encumbrance from the affected Asset.   


 
7.4.2
Ownership Variance -   


 
(a)
If the adjustment is based upon Seller owning a lesser or greater net revenue interest with a corresponding proportionate lesser or greater working interest in an Asset
than that shown on Exhibit C, then the adjustment shall be proportionate to the amount allocated to the affected Asset on Exhibit C. 
 


 
(b)
If the adjustment is based upon a lesser or greater net revenue interest without a corresponding proportionate lesser or greater working interest in an Asset than that
shown on Exhibit C, then the Parties shall use their best efforts to agree upon a mutually acceptable Base Purchase Price adjustment based upon the Allocated Value for such Asset as set forth on Exhibit C.

Valuation of Title Defects -   


 
(a)
If the adjustment is for an item other than as set forth in Sections 7.4.1 or 7.4.2 above, Buyer and Seller shall endeavor to mutually agree on the amount of the
Base Purchase Price adjustment. If the Parties cannot agree to the existence of a Title Defect or Additional Interests or the applicable adjustment, the matter shall be resolved in accordance with the dispute resolution provisions in

and Open Defects do not, in the aggregate, exceed ten (10%) percent of the Base Purchase Price (the Termination Threshold), then Closing shall occur as to the other Assets that are not subject to the dispute (with the portion
of the Assets subject to the dispute being excluded, and the Base Purchase Price reduced for the entire Allocated Values thereof) and Closing shall subsequently occur with respect to the Assets made the subject of the dispute within thirty
(30) days following the final resolution of the dispute.   


 
(b)
Subject to the provisions of Section 7.5, for all Title Defects, Seller shall elect to either: 
   -20-









 
(i)
in the case of Title Defects, either:   


 
(a)
sell to Buyer the entire Asset(s) affected by the Title Defect but reduce the Base Purchase Price by the agreed upon amount associated with such Title Defect; or
  


 
(b)
exclude from this transaction the Assets affected by the Title Defect and reduce the Base Purchase Price for the entire Allocated Value of the Asset(s) so excluded; or
  


 
(c)
if the Asset is excluded from this transaction pursuant to (b) above then Seller shall use reasonable and commercial efforts to attempt to cure the Title Defect within
one hundred eighty (180) days following Closing. If said Title Defect is cured within said one hundred eighty (180) day period then Buyer shall purchase the said excluded Asset for its Allocated Value as of the Effective Time.
  


 
(ii)
in the case of an Additional Interest, sell to Buyer the entire Asset(s) affected by the Additional Interest at the original Allocated Value set forth on Exhibit
C attributable to such Assets proportionately increased to reflect such Additional Interest.   


 
7.5
Deductible for Title Defects - Notwithstanding the provisions set forth above, a Title Defect shall not result in an adjustment to the Base Purchase Price unless
the aggregate net value of the sum of all Title Defects agreed to by the Parties is greater than two percent (2%) of the Base Purchase Price (the Deductible Amount). In such event, the Base Purchase Price on the Closing shall
be adjusted by the aggregate net value of the sum of all Title Defects which collectively exceed the Deductible Amount.

TAXES   


 
12.1
Property Taxes - All ad valorem taxes, property taxes, and similar obligations (Property Taxes) applicable to the Assets with respect to the
2012 Tax period in which the Effective Time occurs (the Current Tax Period) shall be apportioned between Seller and Buyer as of the Effective Time based on the Current Tax Periods assessment. The apportionment method shall
be an allocation based on the number of days the Assets were owned. The amount apportioned to the Seller shall be the number of days the Assets were owned from January 1, 2012 to the day prior to the Effective Time. The amount apportioned to
the Buyer shall be the number of days the Assets were owned from the Effective Time to December 31, 2012. Seller shall reimburse Buyer for Sellers portion of the Current Tax Period at Closing or in connection with any post-closing
settlement provided for herein. Buyer shall file the Tax Return (unless previously filed by Seller) with respect to the Current Tax Period and shall pay any Taxes shown due with respect thereto, subject to Buyers right to reimbursement for the
portion allocable to Seller pursuant to this Section 12.1, regardless of the taxing agencys basis for calculating such Taxes. If Seller pays the Property Taxes assessed for the Current Tax Period, Buyer agrees to reimburse Seller
for Buyers portion of said Taxes at Closing or in connection with any post-closing settlement provided for herein.   


 
12.2
Production Taxes - All Taxes (other than Property Taxes, income, franchise, or similar Taxes) imposed on or with respect to the production of oil, natural gas,
or other hydrocarbons or minerals, or the receipt of proceeds therefrom (including, but not limited to, severance, production and excise Taxes) shall be apportioned between the parties based upon the respective shares of production taken by the
parties. Payment or withholding of all such taxes that have accrued prior to the Effective Time and filing of all statements, returns and documents pertinent thereto shall be the responsibility of Seller. From and after Closing, payment or
withholding of all such Taxes that have accrued from and after the Effective Time and the filing of all statements, returns and documents incident thereto shall be the responsibility of Buyer. In the event any such Taxes attributable to the Assets
and to periods on or after the Effective Time become due and payable prior to Closing, Seller shall timely pay and satisfy the same, and appropriate adjustments therefor shall be made to the Base Purchase Price under Section 3.3 above.
  


 
12.3
Other Taxes - As may be required by relevant taxing agencies, Seller shall collect and Buyer shall pay at Closing all applicable state and local sales tax, use
tax, gross receipts tax, business license tax, and other taxes attributable to the consummation of the 
   -30-









 

transactions under this Agreement except taxes imposed by reason of income to (or capital of) Seller. The tax collected shall be based upon the Allocated Values as provided in Exhibit

12.4

any period ending on or prior to the Closing Date for which a Tax Return has not been filed as of the Effective Time.  ARTICLE 13   


13.
OWNERSHIP OF ASSETS   


 
13.1
Distribution of Production - All oil in storage above the pipeline connection (or less tank bottoms) or gas beyond the meters at the Effective Time shall be
credited to Seller, less applicable royalties and severance taxes. For Seller-operated Assets, Seller has gauged the oil in storage and read all gas meter charts as of the Effective Time. For Seller non-operated Assets, the quantity of such
marketable oil in storage or gas beyond the meters shall be determined on the same basis as that used for Seller-operated Assets based on operator reports or applicable state regulatory agency production reports or records. As part of the Closing
Settlement Statement, the price for such oil in storage shall be at the price that Seller has contracted to sell the oil on the Effective Time. If there is no such price, the price shall be the average of the two highest prices that are posted at
the Effective Time (plus any premium) by other purchasing companies, as determined by Seller in the field or locality where the Assets are located for oil of like grade and gravity. Title to the oil in storage shall pass to Buyer as of the Effective
Time, and an upward adjustment shall be made to the Base Purchase Price due at Closing, less applicable royalties and severance Taxes.   


 
13.2
 Proration of Income and Expenses - Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all proceeds (including proceeds held in suspense or escrow),
receipts, credits, and income attributable to the Assets for all periods of time prior to the Effective Time shall belong to Seller, and all proceeds, receipts, credits, and income attributable to the Assets for all periods of time from and after
the Effective Time shall belong to Buyer. Except as 
   -31-









 

otherwise provided in this Agreement, all costs, expenses, disbursements, and obligations attributable to the Assets for periods of time prior to the Effective Time shall be the obligation of
Seller, and Seller shall promptly pay, or if paid by Buyer, promptly reimburse Buyer for and hold Buyer harmless from and against same. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all costs, expenses, disbursements and obligations attributable
to the Assets for periods of time from and after the Effective Time shall be the obligation of Buyer, and Buyer shall promptly pay, or if paid by Seller, promptly reimburse Seller for and hold Seller harmless from and against same, provided,
however, for the avoidance of doubt, that income, franchise, and similar Taxes of Seller shall not be borne by Buyer.   


 
13.3
Notice to Remitters of Proceeds - Buyer shall be responsible for informing all purchasers of production or other remitters to pay Buyer and obtain from the
remitter revenues accrued after the Effective Time. The remitter shall be informed by Seller and Buyer via Letters-in-Lieu of Transfer Order or such other reasonable documents which remitter may require. 
 


 
13.4
Imbalances - Set forth in Schedule 13.4 is a listing of all gas imbalance volumes derived from the most recent imbalance statement from the Operator of
each Well where a known imbalance exists measured in Mcfs and the aggregate net volume of overproduction or underproduction, as applicable, with respect to the Assets (the Represented Imbalance). As part of the Post Closing
Statement, the Base Purchase Price shall be adjusted, upward or downward as appropriate, to reflect the value of the difference between the aggregate net volume of overproduction or underproduction associated with the Assets set forth on Schedule
13.4 and the aggregate net volume of overproduction or underproduction associated with the Assets as of the Effective Time (the Assumed Imbalances). The value of said difference between the aggregate net volume (less royalties
and other burdens on production) of overproduction or underproduction, as applicable, shall be the product obtained by multiplying $2.00 by the volume of such difference in Mcfs. Buyer shall be solely responsible for any liability and solely
entitled to any benefit from such production imbalances relating to the Assets, whether occurring on, before or after the Effective Time.   


 
13.5
 Pipeline and Other Non Well-head Imbalances - To the extent there exists any imbalances attributable to Hydrocarbons produced from the Assets as
of the Effective Time with respect to any gas pipeline, storage or processing facility (the Pipeline Imbalances), at Closing the Base Purchase Price shall be adjusted upward or downward, as appropriate, to reflect the value of
said Pipeline Imbalance. The value of said Pipeline Imbalance shall be calculated by summing the product(s) obtained by multiplying the volume of each net over-position or under-position, as the case may be, measured in the same manner as it is
measured by the pipeline, storage or processing facility, as applicable, by the value at which the Pipeline Imbalance was either cashed out, made up or sold, or 
   -32-









 

if otherwise undeterminable then using existing fair market value of, or price for, said Hydrocarbons. Buyer shall be solely responsible for any liability and solely entitled to any benefit from
such pipeline imbalances relating to the Assets from and after the Effective Time; provided, that Buyer shall not be liable for any penalties or surcharges payable to the pipeline transport for periods prior to the Effective Time. If the Pipeline
Imbalance cannot be determined by Closing or if the pipeline storage or processing facility makes any adjustments attributable to pre-Effective Time periods subsequent to Closing but prior to the Post Closing Statement, then the value adjustment
associated with any imbalance will be made in connection with the Post Closing Statement.  ARTICLE 14
  


14.
INTERIM OPERATIONS   


 
14.1
Standard of Care - Subject to the additional restrictions set forth in this Section 14.1, Seller shall operate the Seller-operated Assets in

(iii)
not incur costs for discretionary expenditures for operations in excess of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) net to the interest of Seller for which AFEs are not
prepared;

operate, or if Seller is not the operator, use reasonable efforts to ensure that the operator operates the Assets and produces Hydrocarbons therefrom in its ordinary
course of business and in accordance with applicable industry standards and the terms and conditions of all applicable Contracts, laws and regulations;   


 
(v)
not transfer, sell, hypothecate, encumber, abandon or otherwise dispose of any portion of the Assets (other than the sale of Hydrocarbons in the ordinary course of
business or as required in connection with the exercise by third-parties of Preferential Purchase Rights); 
   -33-









 
(vi)
assist the Buyer (without incurring any third party expenses) in preserving the present relationships related to the Assets with Persons having significant business
relations therewith, such as suppliers, customers, brokers, agents or otherwise;   


 
(vii)
take any and all actions necessary to ensure that the Assets are free and clear of all liens and encumbrances as of Closing;

excluded from any coverage provided by an operator for the joint account under an applicable joint operating agreement;   


 
(x)
not incur any indebtedness or take, or fail to take, any actions that would cause a lien or encumbrance to arise or exist on the Assets or otherwise allow a lien to
attach to, or encumber, the Assets or any thereof;   


 
(xi)
pay royalties in the same manner as royalties were paid for such Asset prior to the Effective Time; and 
 


 
(xii)
cause the Assets to be maintained in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable Contracts and applicable laws and regulations and consistent with past
practices, and consult with Buyer with respect to same.   


 
14.2
Liability of Operator - Notwithstanding Section 14.1, Seller shall not be liable to Buyer for any claims, demands, causes of action, damages, or
liabilities arising out of Sellers operation of the Assets pursuant to Section 14.1 after the Effective Time, insofar as Seller continues to operate and maintain the Assets in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and as a
reasonable and prudent operator, insofar as no such Claims, demands, causes of action, damages, or liabilities relating to such interim operation are attributable to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Seller. 
 


 
14.3
Removal of Signs - Buyer shall promptly, but no later than required by applicable rules and regulations or thirty (30) days thereafter, whichever is
earlier, remove any signs and references to Seller and shall erect or install all signs complying with any applicable governmental rules and regulations, including, but not limited to, those showing the Buyer as operator of the Assets.

the operation of the Assets within ten (10) days of Closing. A copy of all such notifications shall be provided to Seller pursuant to the notice provisions contained in Article 18 hereof. 
 


 
14.5
Additional Interests - Seller is currently negotiating with certain third parties concerning acquiring their interests in the Assets (the Third Party
Interest). In the event Seller acquires said Third Party Interest prior to Closing, the Parties shall amend this Agreement to reflect the addition of said Third Party Interest to the Assets. In such an event, the Base Purchase Price for
the Assets shall be increased to reflect the additional Third Party Interest acquired by Seller.  ARTICLE 15
  


15.
EXCHANGE PROVISION 
Seller and Buyer, respectively, shall have the right, prior to Closing, to elect to effect a tax-deferred exchange under Internal Revenue
Code Section 1031 (a Tax Deferred Exchange) for the Assets at any time prior to Closing. If such Party elects to affect a Tax-Deferred Exchange, the other Party agrees to execute escrow instructions, documents, agreements or
instruments to affect the exchange; provided, however, that the other Party shall incur no additional costs, expenses, fees or liabilities as a result of or connected with the exchange. Seller and Buyer, as the case may be, may assign
any of its rights and delegate performance of any of its duties under this Agreement in whole or in part to a third party in order to effect such an exchange; provided, however, that such Seller and/or Buyer shall remain responsible to
the other Party for the full and prompt performance of its respective delegated duties. The electing Party shall indemnify and hold the other Party and its affiliates harmless from and against all claims, expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), loss and liability resulting from its participation in any exchange undertaken pursuant to this Article 15 pursuant to the request of the electing Party.

exceed a deductible equal to one percent (1%) of the Base Purchase Price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Sellers aggregate liability for the indemnification under Section 16.4(i)-(vi) above
shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the Base Purchase Price. 
   -39-









 
16.6
Further Limitation on Indemnification - Neither Party shall have any obligation under Article 16 with respect to any amount which has already been taken
into account and applied to or against the Base Purchase Price in the Closing Settlement Statement or the Post Closing Statement, provided such Party has paid all amounts due pursuant to this Agreement. 
 


 
16.7
Indemnification Procedures   


 
16.7.1
General - All claims for indemnification under this Agreement shall be asserted and resolved pursuant to this Section 16.7. Any person claiming
indemnification hereunder is hereinafter referred to as the Indemnified Party and any person against whom such claims are asserted hereunder is hereinafter referred to as the Indemnifying Party.
  


 
16.7.2
Claim Notice - In the event that a Party wishes to assert a claim for indemnity hereunder, such Party shall with reasonable promptness provide to the
Indemnifying Party a written notice of the indemnity claim it wishes to assert on behalf of itself or another Indemnified Party, including the specific details of and specific basis under this Agreement for its indemnity claim (a Claim
Notice). To the extent any Losses for which indemnification is sought are asserted against or sought to be collected from an Indemnified Party by a third party, such Claim Notice shall include a copy of all papers served on the applicable
Indemnified Party with respect to such claim.   


 
16.7.3
Notice Period - The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from the personal delivery or receipt of the Claim Notice (the Notice
Period) to notify the Indemnified Party (i) whether or not it disputes its liability hereunder with respect to such Losses and/or (ii) with respect to any Losses arising out of, associated with, or relating to third party claims,
whether or not it desires, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, to defend the Indemnified Party against any such Losses. In the event that the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party within the Notice Period that it
desires to defend the Indemnified Party against such Losses, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend all appropriate proceedings with counsel of its own choosing. If the Indemnified Party desires to participate in, but not control, any
such defense or settlement it may do so at its sole cost and expense.   


 
16.7.4
 Cooperation - If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in
contesting any Losses that the Indemnifying Party elects to contest or, if appropriate and related to the claim in question, in making any counterclaims against the third party asserting such Losses, or any cross-complaint against any third party
(other than a Seller Indemnified Party, if the Indemnified Party is a Seller Indemnified Party; and other than 
   -40-









 

a Buyer Indemnified Party, if the Indemnified Party is a Buyer Indemnified Party). Such cooperation shall include the retention and provision to the Indemnifying Party of all records and other
information that are reasonably relevant to the losses at issue.   


 
16.7.5
Settlement - No third party claim that is the subject of indemnification hereunder may be settled or otherwise compromised without the prior written consent of
the Indemnifying Party. No such claim may be settled or compromised by the Indemnifying Party without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party unless such settlement or compromise (i) entails a full and unconditional release of the
Indemnified Party (and any other members of the Indemnified Partys group, i.e., all Seller Indemnified Parties or all Buyer Indemnified Parties) without any admission or finding of fault or liability and (ii) does not impose on the
Indemnified Party any material non-financial obligation or any financial obligation that is not fully paid by the Indemnifying Party.  ARTICLE 17   


17.
CASUALTY LOSS  If prior
to Closing any of the Assets are substantially damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty (Casualty Defect), Seller shall notify Buyer promptly after Seller learns of such event. Seller shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to cure any such Casualty Defect by repairing such damage or, in the case of Equipment, replacing the damaged Equipment with equivalent items, no later than the Closing, insofar as the same are done to Buyers reasonable
satisfaction. If any Casualty Defect exists at Closing, at Sellers option, Buyer shall proceed to purchase the damaged Assets, and the Base Purchase Price shall be reduced by the aggregate reduction in value of all affected Assets on account
of such Casualty Defect. In the event the parties cannot agree on the value, the dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the dispute resolution provisions set forth in Section 20.3. Notwithstanding any of the preceding provisions of
this Article 17, all adjustments applicable to Casualty Defects shall be made prior to Closing which Closing shall be extended until resolution of any disputes relating to the Casualty Defects; provided, however, that if
adjustments for alleged Title Defects, Casualty Defects and Open Defects do not, in the aggregate, exceed the Termination Threshold, then Closing shall occur as to the other Assets that are not subject to the dispute (with the portion of the Assets
subject to the dispute being excluded, and the Base Purchase Price reduced for the entire Allocated Values thereof) and Closing shall subsequently close and consummate the transaction as to the Assets made the subject of the dispute within thirty
(30) days following the final resolution of the dispute. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article 17, Seller shall be entitled to retain all insurance proceeds, if any, and claims against other parties relating
to any such Casualty Defect. For purposes of this provision, normal wear and tear shall not be considered a Casualty Defect.

 ARTICLE 19   


19.
TERMINATION   


 
19.1
Termination - This Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing: 
 


 
(a)
by the mutual written agreement of Buyer and Seller;   


 
(b)
by written notice from either Buyer or Seller if Closing has not occurred on or before December 4, 2012; provided, however, that no Party may
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 19.1(b) if such Partys breach of its representations and warranties or its failure to comply with its obligations or covenants under this Agreement caused the Closing not to occur
on or before the above date; or 
   -42-









 
(c)
by written notice from either Buyer or Seller if the aggregate sum of (i) the Title Defect amounts for all Title Defects timely and properly asserted pursuant to
Article 7, and (ii) the Casualty Defect amounts pursuant to Article 17 exceed the Termination Threshold.   


 
19.2
Liabilities Upon Termination; Deposit Amount - If this Agreement terminates, as described in Section 19.1 above, then the entire Deposit, plus the
actual interest earned thereon, shall be returned and paid to Buyer and all obligations of the Parties under this Agreement shall thereafter terminate and be of no further force and effect, except that the provisions of Sections 20.4 and 20.5
shall survive; provided, however, that if this Agreement is terminated because of either:   


 
(a)
a willful or intentional breach of this Agreement by the Seller or because Buyers conditions to Closing are not satisfied as a result of Sellers willful or
intentional failure to comply with its obligations under this Agreement (and, as a result, Buyer elects to terminate this Agreement under Section 19.1(b) above), then Buyer shall be entitled to the immediate return of the Deposit, plus
the actual interest earned thereon, and shall also be entitled to pursue all remedies available at law for damages or other relief, in equity or otherwise; or 
 


 
(b)
a willful or intentional breach of this Agreement by Buyer or because Sellers conditions to Closing are not satisfied as a result of Buyers willful or
intentional failure to comply with its obligations under this Agreement (and, as a result, Seller elects to terminate this Agreement under Section 19.1(b) above), then Seller shall be entitled to retain the Deposit, plus the actual
interest earned thereon as liquidated damages (and the parties hereby acknowledge that the extent of damages to Seller occasioned by such breach or default or failure to proceed by Buyer would be impossible or extremely impractical to ascertain and
that the Deposit, plus the actual interest earned thereon, is a fair and reasonable estimate of such damage), and pursue its right to obtain specific performance pursuant to Section 20.11. 
   -43-






 ARTICLE 20 
 


20.
MISCELLANEOUS   


 
20.1
Entire Agreement - This Agreement and all Exhibits and Schedules attached hereto and incorporated herein constitute the entire agreement among the Parties. Any
previous negotiations or communications among the Parties are merged herein.   


 
20.2
Survival - This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the undersigned, their successors, heirs, assigns and corporate successors and
may be supplemented, altered, amended, modified, or revoked by writing only, signed by both Parties. The representations made by Seller and Buyer under Articles 5 and 6 shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six
(6) months from and after the Closing Date. All other representations, promises, agreements, releases, and indemnities made in this Agreement or in the Conveyances shall survive Closing. 
 


 
20.3
Selected Arbitration - Any disputes under Sections 7.4.3, 11.3, and 17 that specifically refer to this Section 20.3 shall be resolved by
arbitration to be conducted in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, by a single arbitrator (i) for title matters under Section 7.4(c) who shall be a title attorney, in good standing, with at least ten (10) years experience in oil and gas
title involving properties in the regional area in which the Assets are located, or (ii) for matters under Sections 11.3 or 17 shall be an oil and gas attorney with at least ten (10) years experience in the regional area in which
the Assets are located, who in each case shall be selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller within fifteen (15) Business Days after referral of the disputed matter to arbitration, and absent such agreement, by the Oklahoma City office of
the American Arbitration Association (the Defect Arbitrator). The Defect Arbitrator shall not have been employed by or performed services to any of the Sellers or Buyer for a period of five (5) years prior to the Closing
Date. The arbitration proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this Section 20.3. The Defect
Arbitrators determination shall be made within fifteen (15) Business Days after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding upon the Parties, without right of appeal. Additionally, the Defect Arbitrator may consult
with and engage disinterested third parties to advise the arbitrator, including without limitation petroleum engineers. The Defect Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific dispute referred to the Defect
Arbitrator and may not award damages, interest or penalties to any Party with respect to any matter. Seller and Buyer shall each bear their own respective legal fees and other 
   -44-






 
costs of presenting this case. Seller, on one part, and Buyer, on the other part, shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Defect Arbitrator, including any costs incurred by the
Defect Arbitrator that are attributable to such third party consultation. Except as expressly set forth above, no other dispute under this Agreement shall be resolved by arbitration, except by the mutual agreement of the Parties. 
 


 
20.4
Confidentiality - This Agreement, the terms and provisions hereof and all information associated with the Assets, including the Base Purchase Price, shall be
maintained confidential by Buyer Group until Closing; provided, however, that this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof may be disclosed by Buyer Group (i) to its lenders, bankers and lawyers if any, and any consultants
who are assisting Buyer Group with this transaction to the extent such lenders, bankers, lawyers and consultants agree to keep such information confidential and (ii) to the extent necessary to comply with applicable laws, including, without
limitation, governmental regulatory, disclosure, tax and reporting requirements, including but not limited to the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act of 1934, each as amended. In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Article 19, Buyer Group agrees to keep all of the terms of this transaction confidential for a period of one (1) year following the termination of this Agreement except as otherwise required by applicable law, regulation or legal process
or as required pursuant to a Preferential Purchase Right notice or similar provision.   


 
20.5
Choice of Law - THIS AGREEMENT AND ITS PERFORMANCE SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, AND GOVERNED BY, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA.

Assignment - The rights and obligations under this Agreement may not be assigned prior to Closing by any Party without the prior written consent of the other
Party.   


 
20.7
No Admissions - Neither this Agreement, nor any part hereof, nor any performance under this Agreement shall constitute or be construed as a finding, evidence of,
or an admission or acknowledgment of any liability, fault, or past or present wrongdoing, or violation of any law, rule, regulation, or policy, by either Seller or Buyer or by their respective officers, directors, employees, or agents.
  


 
20.8

20.9
Counterparts This Agreement may be executed by Buyer and Seller in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original instrument, but all of
which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Execution can be evidenced by facsimile transmission of signatures pages with original signature pages to promptly follow in due course. 
 


 
20.10
Third-Party Beneficiaries - Neither this Agreement nor any performances hereunder by Seller or Buyer shall create any right, claim, cause of action, or remedy on
behalf of any person not a party hereto.   


 
20.11
Specific Performance - Subject to the provisions of Article 19, Buyer and Sellers acknowledge and agree that Seller or Buyer would be irreparably damaged if any
of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms and that any breach of this Agreement by the other party could not be adequately compensated in all cases by monetary damages alone. Accordingly, in
addition to any other right or remedy to which Seller and Buyer may be entitled, at law or in equity, they shall be entitled to enforce any provision of this Agreement by a decree of specific performance. 
 


 
20.12
Public Communications - After the Execution Date, either Party may make a press release or public communication concerning this transaction; provided,
however, any such press release or public communication is subject to the other Partys prior review and written approval, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld; provided further, however, that; if Buyer, on the
one hand, or Seller, on the other is required by law or the rules of the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ to make such public announcement or statement, then the same may be made without the approval of the other Parties. 
 


 
20.13

any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement.

transaction contemplated hereby, including brokers fees. Buyer shall be responsible for the cost of all fees for the recording of the Conveyances relating to the Assets. All other costs shall be borne by the Party incurring them.
  


 
20.15
Waiver of Consumer and Other Rights - Seller and Buyer intend that Buyers rights and remedies with respect to the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement and with respect to all acts or practices of Seller, past, present or future, in connection with the transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall be governed by legal principles other than the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Consumer
Protection Act, Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. §17.41, et seq. (Vernon 1987) (the DTPA) or similar laws in other states. BUYER WAIVES IT RIGHTS UNDER THE DTPA SPECIFICALLY INCLUDING SECTION 17.41 ET. SEQ., VERNONS
TEXAS CODE ANNOTATED, BUSINESS AND COMMERCE, A LAW THAT GIVES CONSUMERS SPECIAL RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS, OR ANY SIMILAR STATE OR FEDERAL LAW. AFTER AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY OF ITS OWN SELECTION, BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE
DISCLAIMERS AND WAIVERS GIVEN IN AND UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSIDERED MATERIAL AND INTEGRAL PARTS OF THIS AGREEMENT, WITH CONSIDERATION GIVEN THEREFORE, AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT ALL DISCLAIMERS AND WAIVERS ARE CONSPICUOUS AND HAVE
BEEN BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF BUYER, AND THAT BUYER HAS VOLUNTARILY AND KNOWINGLY CONSENTED TO ALL DISCLAIMERS AND WAIVERS. Buyer hereby warrants and represents to Seller, as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date, that (i) Buyer is
not in a significantly disparate bargaining position, (ii) Buyer has been represented by legal counsel in connection with the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, which transaction does not involve the purchase or lease of a family
residence occupied or to be occupied as a residence, and which transaction is for a consideration paid or to be paid that exceeds $500,000.00 and (iii) Buyer is a business consumer with assets of $5,000,000.00 or more according to Buyers
most recent financial statement prepared in accordance with GAAP and has knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that enable Buyer to evaluate the merits and risks of the transaction. Buyer acknowledges that the Purchase Price is
predicated upon this waiver of the DTPA and similar laws in other states and the inapplicability of the DTPA and similar laws in other states and Buyers representations and warranties contained in this Section 20.15, and the
Seller, in determining to proceed with entering into this Agreement, have expressly relied upon this waiver and the inapplicability of the DTPA and similar laws in other states and Buyers representations and warranties contained in this
Section 20.15.
