Re:


Eos Petro, Inc. Loan and Warrant







Dear Vicki P. Rollins:




Reference is made to the Loan Agreement effective May 22, 2012, as subsequently amended (the “Loan”) by and between Eos Petro, Inc., a Nevada corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Eos Global Petro, Inc. (collectively referred to as “Eos”) and Vicki P. Rollins (“Lender,” collectively referred to with Eos as the “Parties”).




You are hereby requested in this letter (this “Letter Agreement”) to indicate your agreement to, and acknowledgement of, the following:








1.  


The Parties hereby agree that the maturity date of the Loan is extended to December 31, 2014.











2.  


In consideration for Lender initially entering into the Loan, Eos issued to Lender 175,000 warrants to purchase restricted shares of common stock of Eos at an exercise price of $2.50 per share (the “Initial Warrants”). While the Initial Warrants expired on May 22, 2014, in consideration of Lender’s further extension of the Loan maturity date to December 31, 2014 in this Letter Agreement, Eos hereby agrees that, upon receipt of Lender’s signature below, Eos shall provide to Lender a fully executed document representing the issuance of an additional 175,000 warrants to purchase restricted shares of common stock of Eos at $2.50 per share, expiring August 1, 2018, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A.











3.  


The Parties further agree that the principal amount of the Loan shall no longer be deemed to bear any interest, retroactively to the initial date the Loan was made. Moreover, the Loan shall no longer be deemed to start accruing interest at 18% per annum in the event the Loan is not repaid by the new December 31, 2014 maturity date.  In exchange for this total cancellation of accruing interest, Eos  agrees that, upon receipt of Lender’s signature below, Eos shall provide to Lender a fully executed document representing the issuance of an additional 75,000 warrants to purchase restricted shares of common stock of Eos at $4.00 a share, expiring August 1, 2018, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B.











4.  


The Parties hereby acknowledge that the following is a complete and accurate summary of the amount loaned to Eos under the Loan, the interest accruing thereon, the maturity date of the Loan, as amended by this Letter Agreement, and any consideration given or promised to be given to Lender under the Loan through the date first written above:







On May 22, 2012, Eos entered into the Loan to obtain a $350,000 loan from Lender. The maturity date of the Loan is December 31, 2014, and the Loan does not accrue any interest. Eos agreed to issue to Lender 175,000 warrants to purchase common stock with an exercise price of $2.50, which expire August 1, 2018. Moreover, Eos agreed to issue to Lender an additional 75,000 warrants to purchase common stock with an exercise price of $4.00, which expire August 1, 2018. The loan is secured by a subordinate blanket security interest in Eos’ collateral.








5.  


Acknowledgement of Good Standing.  Parties agree and acknowledge that any and all Events of Default which may have occurred under the Loan on or prior to the date hereof are hereby waived, and the Parties further acknowledge that the Loan, as modified by this letter agreement, is in good standing and full force and effect as of the date hereof.

6.  


Further Assurances. The Parties agree to execute and deliver such further instruments and take or cause to be taken such other or further action as may be reasonably requested in order to perfect, confirm or evidence the release of any security interest pursuant to Section 3 above, or of any other obligation evidenced by this letter agreement.

Warrant No. EPW2014-6

 

July 1, 2014

 




EOS PETRO, INC.

 

WARRANT TO PURCHASE COMMON STOCK

 

****175,000 Shares of Common Stock****

 

THIS WARRANT CERTIFIES THAT, for value received, Vicki P. Rollins, or registered assigns (the “Holder”), is entitled to subscribe for and purchase from Eos Petro, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Company”), up to and including the number of fully paid and nonassessable, restricted shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”) of the Company set forth above, at the exercise price of $2.50 per share ( the “Warrant Exercise Price”) (and as adjusted from time to time pursuant to Section III hereof), at any time or from time to time from the date first set forth above (the “Issue Date”) and prior to or upon August 1, 2018 (the “Expiration Date”), subject to the provisions and upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth:

 

I.           Method of Exercise; Cash Payment; Issuance of New Warrant.

 

A.         Subject to the provisions of this Warrant, the purchase right represented by this Warrant may be exercised by the Holder hereof, in whole or in part and from time to time, at the election of the Holder hereof, by the surrender of this Warrant (with the notice of exercise substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A duly completed and executed) at the principal executive offices of the Company and accompanied by payment to the Company, by wire transfer to an account designated by the Company, of an amount equal to the then applicable Warrant Exercise Price multiplied by the number of Warrant Shares then being purchased.

 

B.         The person or persons in whose name(s) any certificate(s) representing the shares of the Company’s capital stock to be issued upon exercise of this Warrant (the “Warrant Shares”) shall be deemed to have become the holder(s) of record of, and shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder(s) of, the shares represented thereby (and such shares shall be deemed to have been issued) immediately prior to the close of business on the date or dates upon which this Warrant is exercised.  In the event of any exercise of the rights represented by this Warrant, certificates for the Warrant Shares so purchased shall be delivered to the Holder hereof as soon as possible and in any event within twenty (20) days after such exercise and, unless this Warrant has been fully exercised or expired, a new warrant having the same terms as this Warrant and representing the remaining portion of such shares, if any, with respect to which this Warrant shall not then have been exercised shall also be issued to the Holder hereof as soon as possible and in any event within such 20-day period.

 

II.           Reservation of Shares.   During the period within which the rights represented by this Warrant may be exercised, the Company will at all times have authorized, and reserved for the purpose of the issuance upon exercise of the purchase rights evidenced by this Warrant a sufficient number of shares of its capital stock to provide for the exercise of the rights represented by this Warrant.



  



 







  



 

III.            Adjustment of Warrant Exercise Price and Number of Shares. The number and kind of securities purchasable upon the exercise of this Warrant and the Warrant Exercise Price shall be subject to adjustment to the nearest whole share (one-half and greater being rounded upward) and nearest cent (one-half cent and greater being rounded upward) from time to time upon the occurrence of certain events, as follows.  Each of the adjustments provided by the subsections below shall be deemed separate adjustments and any adjustment of this Warrant pursuant to one subsection of this Section III shall preclude additional adjustments for the same event or transaction by the remaining subsections.

 

A.      Reclassification.  In case of any reclassification or change of securities of the class issuable upon exercise of this Warrant (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a subdivision or combination) into the same or a different number or class of securities, the Company shall duly execute and deliver to the Holder of this Warrant a new warrant (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Holder of this Warrant), so that the Holder of this Warrant shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon exercise of this Warrant, at a total purchase price not to exceed that payable upon the exercise of the unexercised portion of this Warrant, and in lieu of the shares of Common Stock theretofore issuable upon exercise of this Warrant, the kind and amount of shares of stock, other securities, money and property receivable upon such reclassification or change by a holder of the number of shares then purchasable under this Warrant.  The Company shall deliver such new warrant as soon as possible and in any event within 20 days after such reclassification or change.  Such new warrant shall provide for adjustments that shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Section III.  The provisions of this subparagraph (A) shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications or changes.

 

B.      Stock Splits or Combination of Shares.  If the Company at any time while this Warrant remains outstanding and unexpired shall subdivide (by stock split) or combine (by reverse stock split) its outstanding shares of capital stock of the class into which this Warrant is exercisable, the Warrant Exercise Price shall be proportionately decreased in the case of a subdivision or increased in the case of a combination, effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be proportionately increased in the case of a subdivision or decreased in the case of a combination, and in each case to the nearest whole share, effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective.  The provisions of this subparagraph (B) shall similarly apply to successive subdivisions or combinations of outstanding shares of capital stock into which this Warrant is exercisable.

 

C.      Common Stock Dividends.  If the Company at any time while this Warrant is outstanding and unexpired shall pay a dividend with respect to Common Stock payable in Common Stock, then (i) the Warrant Exercise Price shall be adjusted, from and after the date of determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution (the “Record Date”), to that price determined by multiplying the Warrant Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such date of determination by a fraction (A) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such dividend or distribution, and (B) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such dividend or distribution and (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be proportionately adjusted, to the nearest whole share, from and after the Record Date by multiplying the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable hereunder immediately prior to such Record Date by a fraction (A) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such dividend or distribution, and (B) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such dividend or distribution.  The provisions of this subparagraph (C) shall similarly apply to successive Common Stock dividends by the Company.

 



  



 







  



 

IV.           Notice of Adjustments.  Whenever the Warrant Exercise Price or the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable hereunder shall be adjusted pursuant to Section III above, the Company shall deliver a written notice, setting forth, in reasonable detail, the event requiring the adjustment, the amount of the adjustment, the method by which such adjustment was calculated, and the Warrant Exercise Price and the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable hereunder after giving effect to such adjustment, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause copies of such notice to be delivered to the Holder of this Warrant within twenty (20) days after the occurrence of the event resulting in such adjustment at such Holder’s last known address in accordance with Section IX hereof.

 

V.           Fractional Shares.  No fractional shares will be issued in connection with any exercise hereunder, but in lieu of such fractional shares, the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number.

 

VI.           Compliance with Securities Act of 1933; Transfer of Warrant or Shares.

 

A.      Compliance with Securities Act of 1933.  The Holder of this Warrant, by acceptance hereof, agrees that this Warrant, the Warrant Shares and the capital stock issuable upon conversion of the Warrant Shares (collectively, the “Securities”) are being acquired for investment and that such holder will not offer, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the Securities except under circumstances which will not result in a violation of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) and any applicable state securities laws.  Upon exercise of this Warrant, unless the Warrant Shares being acquired are registered under the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws or an exemption from such registration is available, the Holder hereof shall confirm in writing that the Warrant Shares so purchased are being acquired for investment and not with a view toward distribution or resale in violation of the Securities Act and shall confirm such other matters related thereto as may be reasonably requested by the Company.  The Warrant Shares (unless registered under the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws) shall be stamped or imprinted with a legend in substantially the following form:

 

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “ACT”). THEY MAY NOT BE SOLD, OFFERED FOR SALE, PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED IN THE ABSENCE OF AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT AS TO THE SECURITIES UNDER THE ACT OR EVIDENCE SATISFACTORY TO THE CORPORATION THAT SUCH REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED.

 

Such legend shall be removed by the Company, upon the request of a Holder, at such time as the restrictions on the transfer of the applicable security shall have terminated.

 

B.      Transferability of the Warrant.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Warrants shall be transferable to any other person with the prior written consent of the Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 

C.      Method of Transfer.  With respect to any offer, sale, transfer or other disposition of the Securities, the Holder hereof shall prior to such offer, sale, transfer or other disposition:

 

(i)            surrender this Warrant or certificate representing Warrant Shares at the principal executive offices of the Company or provide evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company of the loss, theft or destruction of this Warrant or certificate representing Warrant Shares and an indemnity agreement reasonable satisfactory to the Company,

 

(ii)            pay any applicable transfer taxes or establish to the satisfaction of the Company that such taxes have been paid,

 

(iii)            deliver a written assignment to the Company in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit B or appropriate stock power duly completed and executed prior to transfer, describing briefly the manner thereof, and

 



  



 







  



 

(iv)            deliver evidence, including a written opinion of such Holder’s counsel if reasonably requested by the Company, to the effect that such offer, sale, transfer or other disposition may be effected without registration or qualification (under the Securities Act as then in effect and any applicable state securities law then in effect) of the Securities.

 

           As soon as reasonably practicable after receiving the items set forth above, the Company shall notify the Holder that it may sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the Securities, all in accordance with the terms of the notice delivered to the Company.  If a determination has been made pursuant to this Section VI.C. that the opinion of counsel for the Holder or other evidence is not reasonably satisfactory to the Company, the Company shall so notify the Holder promptly with details of such determination.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Securities may, as to such federal laws, be offered, sold or otherwise disposed of in accordance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act if the Company satisfied the provisions thereof and provided that the Holder shall furnish such information as the Company may reasonably request to provide a reasonable assurance that the provisions of Rule 144 have been satisfied.  Each certificate representing this Warrant or Warrant Shares thus transferred (except a transfer pursuant to Rule 144 or an effective registration statement) shall bear a legend as to the applicable restrictions on transferability in order to ensure compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws, unless in the aforesaid opinion of counsel to the Holder and to the reasonable satisfaction of the Company, such legend is not required in order to ensure compliance with such laws.  Upon any partial transfer of this Warrant, the Company will issue and deliver to such new holder a new warrant (in form and substance similar to this Warrant) with respect to the portion transferred and will issue and deliver to the Holder a new warrant (in form and substance similar to this Warrant) with respect to the portion not transferred as soon as possible and in any event within 20 days after such transfer.

 

VII.           No Rights as Shareholders; Information.  Prior to exercise of this Warrant, the  Holder of this Warrant, as such, shall not be entitled to vote the Warrant Shares or receive dividends on or be deemed the holder of such shares, nor shall anything contained herein be construed to confer upon the Holder of this Warrant, as such, any of the rights of a shareholder of the Company or any right to vote for the election of directors or upon any matter submitted to shareholders at any meeting thereof, or to receive notice of meetings, or to receive dividends or subscription rights or otherwise until this Warrant shall have been exercised and the shares of Common Stock purchasable upon the exercise hereof shall have become deliverable, as provided herein.

 

VIII.           Modification and Waiver; Effect of Amendment or Waiver.  This Warrant and any provision hereof may be modified, amended, waived, discharged or terminated only by an instrument in writing, designated as an amendment to this Warrant and executed by a duly authorized officer of the Company and the Holder of this Warrant.  Any waiver or amendment effected in accordance with this Section VIII shall be binding upon the Holder, each future holder of this Warrant or of any shares purchased under this Warrant (including securities into which such shares have been converted) and the Company.

 

IX.           Notices.  Any notices or other communications required or permitted to be given under this Warrant must be in writing and addressed to Company or Holder at the addresses below, or at such other address as either party may from time to time designate in writing.  Any notice or communication that is addressed as provided in this Section will be deemed given (a) upon delivery, if delivered personally or via certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested; or (b) on the first business day of the receiving party after the transmission if by facsimile or after the timely delivery to the courier, if delivered by overnight courier.  Other methods of delivery will be acceptable only upon proof of receipt by the party to whom notice is delivered.

XI.           Lost Warrants or Stock Certificates.  Upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Warrant or any stock certificate and, in the case of any such loss, theft or destruction, upon receipt of an indemnity agreement reasonably satisfactory to the Company, or in the case of any such mutilation upon surrender and cancellation of such mutilated Warrant or stock certificate, the Company will issue and deliver a new warrant (containing the same terms as this Warrant) or stock certificate, in lieu of the lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Warrant or stock certificate.

 

XII.           Descriptive Headings.  The descriptive headings of the several paragraphs of this Warrant are inserted for convenience only and do not constitute a part of this Warrant.  The language in this Warrant shall be construed as to its fair meaning without regard to which party drafted this Warrant.

 

XIII.           Governing Law.  This Warrant shall be construed and enforced in accordance with, and the rights of the parties shall be governed by, the laws of the State of Nevada, without reference to principles governing choice or conflicts of laws.

 

XIV.           Entire Agreement.  This Warrant constitutes the full and entire understanding and agreement between the parties with regard to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, representations, and undertakings of the parties, whether oral or written, with respect to such subject matter.

 

XV.           No Impairment.  The Company will not, by an voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed under this Warrant by the Company, but will at all times in good faith assist in carrying out all the provisions of this Warrant and in the taking of all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the rights of the Holder of this Warrant against impairment.

 

XVI.           Issue Taxes.  The Company shall pay any and all issue and other taxes payable in respect of any issue or delivery of Common Stock upon the exercise of this Warrant that may be imposed under the laws of the United States of America or by any state, political subdivision or taxing authority of the United States of America; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to pay any tax or taxes that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue or delivery of any Warrant or certificates for Common Stock in a name other than that of the registered holder of such Warrant, and no such issue or delivery shall be made unless and until the person or entity requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the Company the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been paid.

 

XVII.           Severability.  In the event that any one or more of the provisions contained in this Warrant shall for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such provision(s) shall be ineffective only to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Warrant and such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Warrant, which shall remain in full force and effect.

 

XVIII.           Survival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements.  All representations and warranties of the Company and the Holder hereof shall survive the Issue Date of this Warrant, the exercise or conversion of this Warrant (or any part hereof) or the termination or expiration of rights hereunder.  All agreements of the Company and the Holder hereof contained herein shall survive indefinitely, until by their respective terms, they are no longer operative.

WARRANT TO PURCHASE COMMON STOCK

 

****75,000 Shares of Common Stock****

 

THIS WARRANT CERTIFIES THAT, for value received, Vicki P. Rollins, or registered assigns (the “Holder”), is entitled to subscribe for and purchase from Eos Petro, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Company”), up to and including the number of fully paid and nonassessable, restricted shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”) of the Company set forth above, at the exercise price of $4.00 per share ( the “Warrant Exercise Price”) (and as adjusted from time to time pursuant to Section III hereof), at any time or from time to time from the date first set forth above (the “Issue Date”) and prior to or upon August 1, 2018 (the “Expiration Date”), subject to the provisions and upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth:

 

I.           Method of Exercise; Cash Payment; Issuance of New Warrant.

 

A.         Subject to the provisions of this Warrant, the purchase right represented by this Warrant may be exercised by the Holder hereof, in whole or in part and from time to time, at the election of the Holder hereof, by the surrender of this Warrant (with the notice of exercise substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A duly completed and executed) at the principal executive offices of the Company and accompanied by payment to the Company, by wire transfer to an account designated by the Company, of an amount equal to the then applicable Warrant Exercise Price multiplied by the number of Warrant Shares then being purchased.

 

B.         The person or persons in whose name(s) any certificate(s) representing the shares of the Company’s capital stock to be issued upon exercise of this Warrant (the “Warrant Shares”) shall be deemed to have become the holder(s) of record of, and shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder(s) of, the shares represented thereby (and such shares shall be deemed to have been issued) immediately prior to the close of business on the date or dates upon which this Warrant is exercised.  In the event of any exercise of the rights represented by this Warrant, certificates for the Warrant Shares so purchased shall be delivered to the Holder hereof as soon as possible and in any event within twenty (20) days after such exercise and, unless this Warrant has been fully exercised or expired, a new warrant having the same terms as this Warrant and representing the remaining portion of such shares, if any, with respect to which this Warrant shall not then have been exercised shall also be issued to the Holder hereof as soon as possible and in any event within such 20-day period.

 

II.           Reservation of Shares.   During the period within which the rights represented by this Warrant may be exercised, the Company will at all times have authorized, and reserved for the purpose of the issuance upon exercise of the purchase rights evidenced by this Warrant a sufficient number of shares of its capital stock to provide for the exercise of the rights represented by this Warrant.



  



 







  



 

III.            Adjustment of Warrant Exercise Price and Number of Shares. The number and kind of securities purchasable upon the exercise of this Warrant and the Warrant Exercise Price shall be subject to adjustment to the nearest whole share (one-half and greater being rounded upward) and nearest cent (one-half cent and greater being rounded upward) from time to time upon the occurrence of certain events, as follows.  Each of the adjustments provided by the subsections below shall be deemed separate adjustments and any adjustment of this Warrant pursuant to one subsection of this Section III shall preclude additional adjustments for the same event or transaction by the remaining subsections.

 

A.      Reclassification.  In case of any reclassification or change of securities of the class issuable upon exercise of this Warrant (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a subdivision or combination) into the same or a different number or class of securities, the Company shall duly execute and deliver to the Holder of this Warrant a new warrant (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Holder of this Warrant), so that the Holder of this Warrant shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon exercise of this Warrant, at a total purchase price not to exceed that payable upon the exercise of the unexercised portion of this Warrant, and in lieu of the shares of Common Stock theretofore issuable upon exercise of this Warrant, the kind and amount of shares of stock, other securities, money and property receivable upon such reclassification or change by a holder of the number of shares then purchasable under this Warrant.  The Company shall deliver such new warrant as soon as possible and in any event within 20 days after such reclassification or change.  Such new warrant shall provide for adjustments that shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Section III.  The provisions of this subparagraph (A) shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications or changes.

 

B.      Stock Splits or Combination of Shares.  If the Company at any time while this Warrant remains outstanding and unexpired shall subdivide (by stock split) or combine (by reverse stock split) its outstanding shares of capital stock of the class into which this Warrant is exercisable, the Warrant Exercise Price shall be proportionately decreased in the case of a subdivision or increased in the case of a combination, effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be proportionately increased in the case of a subdivision or decreased in the case of a combination, and in each case to the nearest whole share, effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective.  The provisions of this subparagraph (B) shall similarly apply to successive subdivisions or combinations of outstanding shares of capital stock into which this Warrant is exercisable.

 

C.      Common Stock Dividends.  If the Company at any time while this Warrant is outstanding and unexpired shall pay a dividend with respect to Common Stock payable in Common Stock, then (i) the Warrant Exercise Price shall be adjusted, from and after the date of determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution (the “Record Date”), to that price determined by multiplying the Warrant Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such date of determination by a fraction (A) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such dividend or distribution, and (B) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such dividend or distribution and (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be proportionately adjusted, to the nearest whole share, from and after the Record Date by multiplying the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable hereunder immediately prior to such Record Date by a fraction (A) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such dividend or distribution, and (B) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such dividend or distribution.  The provisions of this subparagraph (C) shall similarly apply to successive Common Stock dividends by the Company.

 



  



 







  



 

IV.           Notice of Adjustments.  Whenever the Warrant Exercise Price or the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable hereunder shall be adjusted pursuant to Section III above, the Company shall deliver a written notice, setting forth, in reasonable detail, the event requiring the adjustment, the amount of the adjustment, the method by which such adjustment was calculated, and the Warrant Exercise Price and the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable hereunder after giving effect to such adjustment, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause copies of such notice to be delivered to the Holder of this Warrant within twenty (20) days after the occurrence of the event resulting in such adjustment at such Holder’s last known address in accordance with Section IX hereof.

 

V.           Fractional Shares.  No fractional shares will be issued in connection with any exercise hereunder, but in lieu of such fractional shares, the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number.

 

VI.           Compliance with Securities Act of 1933; Transfer of Warrant or Shares.

 

A.      Compliance with Securities Act of 1933.  The Holder of this Warrant, by acceptance hereof, agrees that this Warrant, the Warrant Shares and the capital stock issuable upon conversion of the Warrant Shares (collectively, the “Securities”) are being acquired for investment and that such holder will not offer, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the Securities except under circumstances which will not result in a violation of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) and any applicable state securities laws.  Upon exercise of this Warrant, unless the Warrant Shares being acquired are registered under the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws or an exemption from such registration is available, the Holder hereof shall confirm in writing that the Warrant Shares so purchased are being acquired for investment and not with a view toward distribution or resale in violation of the Securities Act and shall confirm such other matters related thereto as may be reasonably requested by the Company.  The Warrant Shares (unless registered under the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws) shall be stamped or imprinted with a legend in substantially the following form:

 

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “ACT”). THEY MAY NOT BE SOLD, OFFERED FOR SALE, PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED IN THE ABSENCE OF AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT AS TO THE SECURITIES UNDER THE ACT OR EVIDENCE SATISFACTORY TO THE CORPORATION THAT SUCH REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED.

 

Such legend shall be removed by the Company, upon the request of a Holder, at such time as the restrictions on the transfer of the applicable security shall have terminated.

 

B.      Transferability of the Warrant.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Warrants shall be transferable to any other person with the prior written consent of the Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 

C.      Method of Transfer.  With respect to any offer, sale, transfer or other disposition of the Securities, the Holder hereof shall prior to such offer, sale, transfer or other disposition:

 

(i)            surrender this Warrant or certificate representing Warrant Shares at the principal executive offices of the Company or provide evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company of the loss, theft or destruction of this Warrant or certificate representing Warrant Shares and an indemnity agreement reasonable satisfactory to the Company,

 

(ii)            pay any applicable transfer taxes or establish to the satisfaction of the Company that such taxes have been paid,

 

(iii)            deliver a written assignment to the Company in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit B or appropriate stock power duly completed and executed prior to transfer, describing briefly the manner thereof, and

 



  



 







  



 

(iv)            deliver evidence, including a written opinion of such Holder’s counsel if reasonably requested by the Company, to the effect that such offer, sale, transfer or other disposition may be effected without registration or qualification (under the Securities Act as then in effect and any applicable state securities law then in effect) of the Securities.

 

           As soon as reasonably practicable after receiving the items set forth above, the Company shall notify the Holder that it may sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the Securities, all in accordance with the terms of the notice delivered to the Company.  If a determination has been made pursuant to this Section VI.C. that the opinion of counsel for the Holder or other evidence is not reasonably satisfactory to the Company, the Company shall so notify the Holder promptly with details of such determination.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Securities may, as to such federal laws, be offered, sold or otherwise disposed of in accordance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act if the Company satisfied the provisions thereof and provided that the Holder shall furnish such information as the Company may reasonably request to provide a reasonable assurance that the provisions of Rule 144 have been satisfied.  Each certificate representing this Warrant or Warrant Shares thus transferred (except a transfer pursuant to Rule 144 or an effective registration statement) shall bear a legend as to the applicable restrictions on transferability in order to ensure compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws, unless in the aforesaid opinion of counsel to the Holder and to the reasonable satisfaction of the Company, such legend is not required in order to ensure compliance with such laws.  Upon any partial transfer of this Warrant, the Company will issue and deliver to such new holder a new warrant (in form and substance similar to this Warrant) with respect to the portion transferred and will issue and deliver to the Holder a new warrant (in form and substance similar to this Warrant) with respect to the portion not transferred as soon as possible and in any event within 20 days after such transfer.

 

VII.           No Rights as Shareholders; Information.  Prior to exercise of this Warrant, the  Holder of this Warrant, as such, shall not be entitled to vote the Warrant Shares or receive dividends on or be deemed the holder of such shares, nor shall anything contained herein be construed to confer upon the Holder of this Warrant, as such, any of the rights of a shareholder of the Company or any right to vote for the election of directors or upon any matter submitted to shareholders at any meeting thereof, or to receive notice of meetings, or to receive dividends or subscription rights or otherwise until this Warrant shall have been exercised and the shares of Common Stock purchasable upon the exercise hereof shall have become deliverable, as provided herein.

 

VIII.           Modification and Waiver; Effect of Amendment or Waiver.  This Warrant and any provision hereof may be modified, amended, waived, discharged or terminated only by an instrument in writing, designated as an amendment to this Warrant and executed by a duly authorized officer of the Company and the Holder of this Warrant.  Any waiver or amendment effected in accordance with this Section VIII shall be binding upon the Holder, each future holder of this Warrant or of any shares purchased under this Warrant (including securities into which such shares have been converted) and the Company.

 

IX.           Notices.  Any notices or other communications required or permitted to be given under this Warrant must be in writing and addressed to Company or Holder at the addresses below, or at such other address as either party may from time to time designate in writing.  Any notice or communication that is addressed as provided in this Section will be deemed given (a) upon delivery, if delivered personally or via certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested; or (b) on the first business day of the receiving party after the transmission if by facsimile or after the timely delivery to the courier, if delivered by overnight courier.  Other methods of delivery will be acceptable only upon proof of receipt by the party to whom notice is delivered.

X.           Reorganizations.  In case of any reorganization of the Company, or in case of the consolidation or merger of the Company with or into any other legal entity (other than a merger or consolidation in which the Company is the continuing legal entity) or of the sale of the properties and assets of the Company as, or substantially as, an entirety to any other legal entity (collectively, "Reorganizations"), each Warrant shall after such Reorganization be exercisable, upon the terms and conditions specified in this Warrant Certificate, for the stock or other securities or property (including cash) to which a holder of the number of Common Shares purchasable (at the time of such Reorganization) upon exercise of such Warrant would have been entitled upon such Reorganization if such Warrant had been exercised in full immediately prior to such Reorganization; and in any such case, if necessary, the provisions set forth in this Section X with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the holders of the Warrants shall be appropriately adjusted so as to be applicable, as nearly as may reasonably be, to any such stock or other securities or property thereafter deliverable upon exercise of the Warrants.

 

XI.           Lost Warrants or Stock Certificates.  Upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Warrant or any stock certificate and, in the case of any such loss, theft or destruction, upon receipt of an indemnity agreement reasonably satisfactory to the Company, or in the case of any such mutilation upon surrender and cancellation of such mutilated Warrant or stock certificate, the Company will issue and deliver a new warrant (containing the same terms as this Warrant) or stock certificate, in lieu of the lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Warrant or stock certificate.

 

XII.           Descriptive Headings.  The descriptive headings of the several paragraphs of this Warrant are inserted for convenience only and do not constitute a part of this Warrant.  The language in this Warrant shall be construed as to its fair meaning without regard to which party drafted this Warrant.

 

XIII.           Governing Law.  This Warrant shall be construed and enforced in accordance with, and the rights of the parties shall be governed by, the laws of the State of Nevada, without reference to principles governing choice or conflicts of laws.

 

XIV.           Entire Agreement.  This Warrant constitutes the full and entire understanding and agreement between the parties with regard to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, representations, and undertakings of the parties, whether oral or written, with respect to such subject matter.

 

XV.           No Impairment.  The Company will not, by an voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed under this Warrant by the Company, but will at all times in good faith assist in carrying out all the provisions of this Warrant and in the taking of all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the rights of the Holder of this Warrant against impairment.

 

XVI.           Issue Taxes.  The Company shall pay any and all issue and other taxes payable in respect of any issue or delivery of Common Stock upon the exercise of this Warrant that may be imposed under the laws of the United States of America or by any state, political subdivision or taxing authority of the United States of America; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to pay any tax or taxes that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue or delivery of any Warrant or certificates for Common Stock in a name other than that of the registered holder of such Warrant, and no such issue or delivery shall be made unless and until the person or entity requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the Company the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been paid.

 

XVII.           Severability.  In the event that any one or more of the provisions contained in this Warrant shall for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such provision(s) shall be ineffective only to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Warrant and such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Warrant, which shall remain in full force and effect.

 

XVIII.           Survival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements.  All representations and warranties of the Company and the Holder hereof shall survive the Issue Date of this Warrant, the exercise or conversion of this Warrant (or any part hereof) or the termination or expiration of rights hereunder.  All agreements of the Company and the Holder hereof contained herein shall survive indefinitely, until by their respective terms, they are no longer operative.

 

XIX.           Counterparts.  This Warrant may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be an original, and all of which together shall constitute one instrument.
