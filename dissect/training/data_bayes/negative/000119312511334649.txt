offer is limited to a shorter period of time in which case the indemnifying party shall have such shorter period of time in which to accept or reject the proposed settlement. Failure of the indemnifying party to accept or reject such settlement

therefor as to (and only as to) liabilities with respect to which the indemnifying party has recognized its liability.
