(a)           Section 1.01 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by adding the following new defined terms:
 
Commodity Exchange Act means the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.), as amended from time to time, and any successor statute.
 
Excluded Swap Obligations means, with respect to any Obligor other than the Borrower, any Swap Obligations if, and to the extent that, all or a portion of the guarantee of such Obligor of, or the grant by such Obligor of a security interest to secure, such Swap Obligation (or any guarantee thereof) is or becomes illegal under the Commodity Exchange Act or any rule, regulation or order of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (or the application or official interpretation of any thereof) by virtue of such Obligors failure for any reason to constitute an eligible contract participant as defined in the Commodity Exchange Act and the regulations thereunder at the time the guarantee of such Obligor or the grant of such security interest becomes effective with respect to such Swap Obligation.  If a Swap Obligation arises under a master agreement governing more than one swap, such exclusion shall apply only to the portion of such Swap Obligation that is attributable to swaps for which such guarantee or security interest is or becomes illegal.
 
Qualified ECP Guarantor means, in respect of any Swap Obligation, each Obligor that has total assets exceeding $10,000,000 at the time the relevant Guaranty or grant of the relevant security interest becomes effective with respect to such Swap Obligation or such other Person as constitutes an eligible contract participant under the Commodity Exchange Act or any regulations promulgated thereunder and

Swap Obligation means, with respect to any Guarantor, any obligation to pay or perform under any agreement, contract or transaction that constitutes a swap within the meaning of section 1a(47) of the Commodity Exchange Act.
 
(b)           The definition of Obligations in Section 1.01 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by adding the following new sentence to the end thereof:

(c)           Section 7.06 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by adding the following new sentence to the end thereof:
 
Excluded Swap Obligations with respect to any Guarantor shall not be paid with amounts received from such Guarantor or its assets, but appropriate adjustments shall be made with respect to payments from other Obligors to preserve the allocation to Obligations otherwise set forth above in this Section.
 
(d)           The Credit Agreement is hereby amended by deleting Section 10.16 in its entirety and replacing it with the following new Section 10.16:
 
Section 10.16       Keepwell.  Each Qualified ECP Guarantor hereby jointly and severally absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to provide such funds or other support as may be needed from time to time by each other Obligor to honor all of its obligations under this Agreement in respect of Swap Obligations (provided, however, that each Qualified ECP Guarantor shall only be liable under this Section 10.16 for the maximum amount of such liability that can be hereby incurred without rendering its obligations under this Section 10.16, or otherwise under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not for any greater amount).  The obligations of each Qualified ECP Guarantor under this Section 10.16 shall remain in full force and effect until the termination of all Commitments and payment in full of all Obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations) and the expiration or termination of all Letters of Credit (other than Letters of Credit as to which other arrangements satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender have been made). Each Qualified ECP Guarantor intends that this Section 10.16 constitute, and this Section 10.16 shall be deemed to constitute, a keepwell, support, or other agreement for the benefit of each other Obligor for all purposes of Section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the Commodity Exchange Act.
