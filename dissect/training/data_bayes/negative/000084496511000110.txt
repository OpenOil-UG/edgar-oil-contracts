(ii)  


an amount equal to all operating and capital costs, expenses and other expenditures (whether capitalized or expensed), actually paid by Buyer that are, in accordance with GAAP, attributable to the ownership or operation of the Assets prior to the Effective Time, including, without duplication, all Royalties, rentals and other burdens on production, transportation and other fees and expenses relating to the transportation, processing and marketing of Hydrocarbons produced prior to the Effective Time; rentals and other similar charges; expenses under applicable joint operating agreements or other contracts or agreements, including without

(iii)

(iv)  


to the extent the Assets are, in the aggregate, overproduced, the value of such net Imbalance, calculated as provided in Section 3.4;

Seller’s share of the amount of all ad valorem, severance, property or other taxes (other than income and sales or use taxes) paid or payable with respect to or attributable to the Assets (“Asset Taxes”) for the tax period in which the Effective Time occurs (the “Current Tax Period”) which are unpaid as of the Closing Date, to the extent attributable to periods prior to the Effective Time, which amount shall, where possible, be computed based upon the tax rate and values applicable to the tax assessment period in question; otherwise, the amount of the adjustment under this paragraph shall be estimated based upon such taxes assessed against the applicable portion of the Assets for the immediately preceding tax assessment period just ended; and




 





(vii)  


any other amount agreed upon in writing by Seller and Buyer.




 

3.2 Closing Statement.  Seller shall prepare, in accordance with the provisions of this Article 3, a statement (the “Closing Adjustment Statement”) setting forth each adjustment to the Base Purchase Price.  Seller shall submit the Closing Adjustment Statement to Buyer, together with reasonable documentation supporting the calculation of amounts presented on the Closing Adjustment Statement, no later than five (5) business days prior to the scheduled Closing Date.  In the event Buyer believes that the Closing Adjustment Statement does not accurately set forth the Purchase Price and/or the adjustments thereto, Buyer shall communicate to Seller in writing such inaccuracies no later than three (3) business days prior to Closing. The Parties shall cooperate to prepare a mutually agreeable Closing Adjustment Statement on or before the date that is two (2) days prior to Closing.  When available, actual figures will be used for the adjustments at Closing.  To the extent actual figures are not available, estimates shall be used, subject to final adjustments as described in Section 3.3 below.

 

3.3 Post-Closing Adjustments.

(A)  


A post-closing adjustment statement (the “Post-Closing Adjustment Statement”) based on the actual income and expenses shall be prepared and delivered by Seller to Buyer within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing Date, proposing further adjustments to the calculation of the Purchase Price based on the information then available.  Seller and Buyer shall each be given access to and shall be entitled to review and audit the other Party’s records pertaining to the computation of amounts in such Post-Closing Adjustment Statement.




 





(B)  


Within one hundred fifty (150) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a written statement describing in reasonable detail its objections (if any) to any amounts or items set forth on or omitted from the Post-Closing Adjustment Statement.  If Buyer does not raise objections within such period, then the Post-Closing Adjustment Statement shall become final and binding upon the Parties at the end of such period.




 





(C)  


If Buyer raises objections, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such objections.  If the Parties are unable to resolve any disputed item within fifteen (15) days after Seller’s receipt of Buyer’s written objections to the Post-Closing Adjustment Statement, any such disputed item shall be submitted to a nationally recognized independent accounting firm mutually agreeable to the Parties (the “Accounting Referee”) who shall be instructed to resolve such disputed item within thirty (30) days.  The resolution of disputes by the Accounting Referee shall be set forth in writing and shall be conclusive, binding upon and non-appealable by the Parties.  The fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee shall be paid one-half by Buyer and one-half by Seller.




 





(D)  


Within five (5) days after the Post-Closing Adjustment Statement has become final and binding on the Parties or, if applicable, the issuance of the Accounting Referee’s decision, then, (i) in the event the estimated Purchase Price paid at Closing is greater than the final Purchase Price, as finally determined in the Post-Closing Adjustment Statement or by the Accounting Referee, as applicable, then Seller shall pay the amount of such difference to Buyer; and (ii) in the event the estimated Purchase Price paid at Closing is less than the final Purchase Price, as finally determined in the Post-Closing Adjustment Statement or by the Accounting Referee, as applicable, then Buyer shall pay the amount of such difference to Seller.




 

3.4 Imbalances.  Buyer shall assume all rights and obligations of Seller arising from Imbalances pertaining to the Assets from and after the Effective Time (whether overproduced or underproduced). The Net Imbalances attributable to the Assets as of the Effective Time are estimated to be as set forth on Schedule 3.4 (the “Agreed Imbalance”), notwithstanding that the actual Imbalance may be less or greater.  Seller shall use reasonable efforts to attempt to determine the actual net Imbalances in preparation of the Post-Closing Adjustment Statement.  The Base Purchase Price shall be increased in the Post-Closing Adjustment Statement by the 

 



  



9







  



 

actual Imbalance as of the Effective Time in the manner set forth below if the Assets are underproduced and shall be decreased in the same manner if the Assets are overproduced, in each case as provided in Section 3.1.  Such Imbalances shall be accounted for between the Parties at the price of $4.00 per MMBtu for gas and $90.00 per barrel for oil (and associated Hydrocarbons).  Such settlement shall be final and neither Party thereafter shall make claim upon the other concerning the Imbalances of the Assets, each Party hereby waiving any such claim to the extent permitted by applicable law.  The term “Imbalance” means any Hydrocarbons production or pipeline imbalance existing as of the Effective Time with respect to any of the Assets, together with any related rights or obligations as to future cash and/or gas or product balancing, as a result of, production or pipeline delivery imbalances.

(B)  


Audit Adjustments.  Seller shall retain all rights and obligations relating to adjustments resulting from any operating agreement and other audit claims asserted by or against third party operators to the extent attributable to ownership or operation of the Assets prior to the Effective Time.  Any credit received by Buyer pertaining to such an audit claim shall be paid to Seller within thirty (30) days after receipt.




 





(C)  


Refunds of Asset Taxes.  Refunds of Asset Taxes shall be promptly paid as follows (or to the extent payable but not paid due to offset against other Taxes shall be promptly paid (or retained, as appropriate) by the Party receiving the benefit of the offset as follows):  (i) to Seller to the extent attributable to periods prior to the Effective Time; and (ii) to Buyer to the extent attributable to periods from and after the Effective Time.




 





(D)  


Other Proceeds and Expenses.  Upon and after Closing, subject to and except as otherwise provided herein and except to the extent an adjustment or an accounting with respect thereto has previously been made, (A) all monies, refunds, proceeds, receipts, credits, receivables, accounts and income attributable to the Assets conveyed hereunder (i) for all periods of time from and after the Effective Time shall be the property and

5.2 Notice of Title Defects.  If Buyer discovers any Title Defect affecting any of the Assets, Buyer shall notify Seller promptly, but in any event prior to the Defect Notice Deadline, of such alleged Title Defect.  To be effective, such notice (“Title Defect Notice”) must (i) be in writing, (ii) be received by Seller prior to the Defect Notice Deadline, (iii) describe the Title Defect in reasonable detail, (iv) identify the specific Asset(s) affected by such Title Defect, and (v) include Buyer’s reasonable estimate of the Title Defect Value.  Any matters that may otherwise constitute Title Defects, but of which Seller has not been specifically notified by Buyer in accordance with the foregoing, shall be deemed to have been waived by Buyer for all purposes.

 

5.3 Remedies for Title Defects.  Upon the receipt of a Title Defect Notice from Buyer delivered in accordance with Section 5.2, Seller shall have the option, but not the obligation, to attempt to cure such Title Defect at any time prior to the Closing.  The cost of such cure or attempted cure of such Title Defect shall be borne by Seller.  If Seller is unable or unwilling to cure the Title Defect before Closing, then Buyer and Seller will have the following rights and remedies with respect to the uncured Title Defect(s):

 





(A)  


Buyer may waive the uncured Title Defect and proceed with Closing without adjustment to the Base Purchase Price.




 





(B)  


If the aggregate Title Defect Values of uncured, unwaived Title Defects together with the aggregate Environmental Defect Values of uncured, unwaived Adverse Environmental Conditions are less than or equal to the Defect Deductible, Seller and Buyer shall proceed with Closing as to all of the Assets without curative action by Seller with respect to such Title Defects and without adjustment to the Base Purchase Price.




 





(C)  


If the aggregate Title Defect Values of uncured, unwaived Title Defects together with the aggregate Environmental Defect Values of uncured, unwaived Adverse Environmental Conditions exceeds the Defect Deductible, then the Base Purchase Price shall be reduced by the amount by which the aggregate Title Defect Values and Environmental Defect Values agreed to by the Parties exceed the Defect Deductible.  If the Parties are unable to agree on whether a Title Defect exists or the Title Defect Value attributable thereto, then (i) if the Title Defect Value of an 




 



  



15







  



 






 


Asset exceeds the Allocated Value for such Asset, Buyer or Seller may, at such Party’s election, exclude the affected Asset from this transaction and reduce the Base Purchase Price by the Allocated Value of the excluded Asset, without application of the Defect Deductible that might otherwise limit the reduction of the Base Purchase Price associated with a Title Defect; or (ii) either party may refer the dispute to an Independent Expert, as defined hereinafter, for determination, in which case the affected Asset shall be included in the Assets delivered at Closing, and, in the event the Title Defect Value(s), as determined by the Independent Expert, when aggregated with all other Title Defect Values and Environmental Defect Values, exceeds the Defect Deductible, the Base Purchase Price shall be adjusted with respect thereto in the Post-Closing Adjustment Statement.




 






(D)  


The remedies set forth in this Section 5.3 are Buyer’s exclusive remedies for all Title Defects, and Seller shall have no other liability to Buyer with respect to Title Defects.




 

5.4 Title Benefits.  If, prior to the Defect Notice Deadline, Buyer identifies a Title Benefit affecting the Assets, Buyer shall notify Seller of such Title Benefit.  Subject to the limitations set out below, Seller shall be entitled to an upward adjustment to the Base Purchase Price with respect to all Title Benefits of which either Party provides (or is required to provide) notice to the other Party (a “Title Benefit Notice”) prior to the Defect Notice Deadline.  If the Title Benefit is in the nature of Seller’s Net Revenue Interest in an Asset being greater than the Net Revenue Interest set forth on Exhibit 1.1(A) and the Working Interest is also proportionately increased, then Buyer and Seller agree that, subject to the limitation set out below, the Base Purchase Price shall be increased by an amount (the “Title Benefit Amount”) equal to the Allocated Value for the relevant Asset multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the increase in such Net Revenue Interest as a result of such Title Benefit and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest specified for such Asset on Exhibit 1.1(A).  No adjustment shall be made with respect to any Title Benefit unless the Title Benefit Amount attributable thereto exceeds $50,000. If with respect to a timely asserted Title Benefit the Parties have not agreed on the validity of the Title Benefit or the Title Benefit Amount attributable thereto on or before Closing, either Party shall have the right to elect by written notice to the other Party to have the validity of the Title Benefit and/or the Title Benefit Amount determined by an Independent Expert pursuant to Article 7.

(D)  


“Environmental Laws” means any statute, law, ordinance, rule, regulation, code, order, judicial writ, injunction, notice to lessees or decree issued by any federal, state, or local governmental authority in effect as of the Effective Time relating to the control of any pollutant or protection of the air, water, land, or environment or the release or disposal of hazardous materials, hazardous substances or waste materials.

6.3 Remedies for Adverse Environmental Conditions.  Upon the receipt of a notice of Adverse Environmental Condition from Buyer delivered in accordance with Section 6.2, Seller shall have the option, but not the obligation, to attempt to cure such Adverse Environmental Condition at any time prior to the Closing.  The cost of such cure or attempted cure of such Adverse Environmental Condition shall be borne by Seller.  If Seller is unable or unwilling to cure the Adverse Environmental Condition before Closing, then Buyer and Seller will have the following rights and remedies with respect to the uncured Adverse Environmental Condition(s):

 





(A)  


Buyer may waive the uncured Adverse Environmental Condition and proceed with Closing without adjustment to the Base Purchase Price.




 



  



17







  



 





(B)  


If the aggregate Environmental Defect Values of uncured, unwaived Adverse Environmental Conditions together with the aggregate Title Defect Values of uncured, unwaived Title Defects are less than or equal to the Defect Deductible, the Parties will be obligated to proceed with Closing without curative action by Seller with respect to such Adverse Environmental Conditions and without adjustment to the Base Purchase Price.




 





(C)  


If the aggregate Environmental Defect Values of uncured, unwaived Adverse Environmental Conditions together with the aggregate Title Defect Values of uncured, unwaived Title Defects exceeds the Defect Deductible, then the Base Purchase Price shall be reduced by the amount by which the aggregate Environmental Defect Values and Title Defect Values agreed to by the Parties exceeds the Defect Deductible.  If the Parties are unable to agree on whether an Adverse Environmental Condition exists or the Environmental Defect Value attributable thereto, then (i) if the Environmental Defect Value of an Asset exceeds the Allocated Value for such Asset, Buyer or Seller may, at such Party’s election, exclude the Asset affected thereby from this transaction and reduce the Base Purchase Price by the Allocated Value of the excluded Asset, without application of the Defect Deductible that might otherwise limit the reduction of the Base Purchase Price associated with an Environmental Defect; or (ii) either Party may refer the dispute to an Independent Expert, for determination, in which case the affected Asset shall be included in the Assets delivered at Closing, and, in the event the Environmental Defect Value(s), as determined by the Independent Expert, when aggregated with all other Environmental Defect Values and Title Defect Values, exceeds the Defect Deductible,  the Base Purchase Price shall be adjusted with respect thereto post-Closing.




 





(D)  


The remedies set forth in this Section 6.3 are the sole and exclusive remedies of Buyer with respect to any adverse environmental condition attributable to the Assets.




 

ARTICLE 7

INDEPENDENT EXPERT.

 

7.1 Independent Expert.  Each party shall have the right to submit disputes regarding the matters covered by Article 5, Article 6 (including the nature or calculation of Title Defects, Title Benefits and Environmental Defects), Article 8, or the pre-Closing Date representations in Sections 10.1(P) and (Q) to an independent expert appointed in accordance with this Section 7.1 (each, an “Independent Expert”), who shall serve as sole arbitrator of such dispute.  An Independent Expert shall be appointed by mutual agreement of Seller and Buyer from among candidates with experience and expertise in the area that is the subject of such dispute, and failing such agreement, such Independent Expert for such dispute shall be selected in accordance with the Rules (as hereinafter defined).  The cost of any such Independent Expert will be borne one-half by Seller and one-half by Buyer.  For any dispute resolution proceeding under this 

 



  



18







  



 

Section 7.1, Seller and Buyer will present a written statement of their respective positions on the dispute to the Independent Expert as soon as practicable after, but in any event within thirty (30) days after, the Independent Expert is selected.  As soon as practicable after, but in any event within thirty (30) days after, receipt of such statements, the Independent Expert will make a determination of all points of disagreement in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  The decision and determination of the value of the Title Defect, Title Benefit or Environmental Defect, as applicable, made by the Independent Expert shall be binding upon the Parties as an award under the Federal Arbitration Act and final and nonappealable to the maximum extent permitted by law, and judgment thereon may be entered in a court of competent jurisdiction and enforced by either Party as a final judgment of such court.

 

ARTICLE 8

CASUALTY LOSS

 

8.1 Casualty Losses and Government Takings.  If, prior to Closing, all or part of an Asset is damaged or destroyed by an act of God, terrorist action, fire, explosion, earthquake, wind storm, hurricane, tornado, tidal surge, flood, drought, condemnation, or other accident (a “Casualty Loss”), or is taken in condemnation or under the right of eminent domain, or if proceedings for such purposes shall be pending or threatened (a “Government Taking”), Seller shall promptly notify Buyer in writing of the nature and extent of the Casualty Loss or Government Taking and Seller’s estimate of the cost required to repair or replace that portion of the Assets affected by the Casualty Loss or value of the Asset taken by the Government Taking.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no individual matter described above shall be deemed to be or constitute a Casualty Loss or a Government Taking unless the estimate of the cost required to repair or replace that portion of the Asset affected by the Casualty Loss or value of the Asset taken by the Government Taking exceeds $50,000, net to Seller’s interest therein.  No Casualty Loss or Government Taking will be considered a Title Defect.  As used herein, a Casualty Loss does not include depletion due to normal production or depreciation or failure of equipment or casing under normal operating conditions.

 

8.2 Remedies for Casualty Losses and Government Takings.  The Base Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by the greater of the mutually agreed (i) amount by which the value of the affected Assets has been diminished as a result of Casualty Loss or Government Taking, or (ii) amount necessary to repair or replace the damaged, destroyed or taken Asset, in each case as such amount is determined by mutual agreement of the Parties (the “Casualty Loss Amount”).  Seller shall retain (i) all insurance proceeds payable to Seller with respect to any such Casualty Loss; (ii) all sums paid to Seller by third parties by reason of any such Casualty Loss; (iii) all compensation paid with respect to any such Government Taking; and (iv) all other right, title and interest of Seller in and to any unpaid awards or other payments from third parties arising out of the damage, destruction or taking of such Assets.  If the Parties are unable to agree upon the Casualty Loss Amount or the existence of a Casualty Loss, then either Party may refer the determination of the existence of a Casualty Loss and/or the amount of the Casualty Loss Amount to an Independent Expert pursuant to Section 7.1.

19







  



 

collapse or sand infiltration of any well, the depreciation of personal property through ordinary wear and tear, and changes arising from operations conducted by Seller pursuant to Section 12.1 in the absence of gross negligence on the part of Seller.  None of such events or conditions occurring after the Effective Time will be considered a Casualty Loss, nor will they be cause for any reduction in the Base Purchase Price, or give rise to any right to terminate this Agreement.

 

ARTICLE 9

PREFERENTIAL RIGHTS AND CONSENTS

 

9.1 Consents.  Promptly after the Parties’ execution of this Agreement, Seller shall commence, and Buyer and Seller shall thereafter exercise, commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all such permissions, approvals and consents from third parties (other than governmental consents customarily obtained post-closing) which may be required in connection with the transfer of any of the Assets to Buyer at Closing.  The Parties hereby acknowledge that “commercially reasonable efforts” shall not include any obligation to expend any money or other consideration in exchange for any consent or approval.  In the event any consent is not obtained prior to the date on which Closing is scheduled to occur, then either Buyer or Seller may, upon written notice to the other Party, extend the Closing for up to thirty (30) days in an effort to obtain such required consent.  In the event such required consent has not been obtained prior to the extended Closing Date then, unless waived by both Parties, the affected Asset shall be excluded from the Assets delivered at Closing and the Base Purchase Price shall be adjusted by the Allocated Value of such Asset (it being understood that, in the event the affected Asset has a negative Allocated Value, the exclusion thereof may result in an increase in the Base Purchase Price).

ARTICLE 19

TAXES

 

19.1 Asset Taxes.

 





(A)  


All Asset Taxes shall be prorated between Buyer and Seller as of the Effective Time for all taxable periods that include the Effective Time.  All Asset Taxes attributable to periods, including partial periods, prior to the Effective Time are the obligation of, and shall be borne by, Seller.  All Asset Taxes attributable to periods, including partial periods, from and after the Effective Time shall be borne by Buyer.  The Base Purchase Price shall be adjusted as provided in Section 3.1(A)(iii) and Section 3.1(B)(ii) with respect to the proration of Asset Taxes for the Current Tax Period that are paid prior to the Closing Date.  With respect to Asset Taxes for the Current Tax Period that are not paid prior to the Closing Date, a proration shall be made between the Parties as an adjustment to the Base Purchase Price pursuant to Section 3.1(B)(iv) based on the best current information available as of Closing, subject to further adjustment in the Post-Closing Adjustment Statement based on then-current information.  If actual Asset Taxes with respect to the Current Tax Period (“Actual Asset Taxes”) are greater than the amounts estimated for purposes of the Post-Closing Adjustment Statement pursuant to Section 3.3 (the “Estimated Asset Taxes”), then Seller shall pay Buyer an amount equal to such difference (the “Underestimated Amount”), multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the Current Tax Period which are prior to the Effective Time and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the Current Tax Period (“Seller’s Pro Rata Share”).  Seller shall pay such amount to Buyer within ten (10) business days of Seller’s receipt of Buyer’s invoice therefor.  If Actual Asset Taxes are less than Estimated Asset Taxes, then Buyer shall pay Seller an amount equal to such difference (the “Overestimated Amount”) multiplied by Seller’s Pro Rata Share.  Buyer shall pay such amount to Seller within ten (10) business days after Buyer’s receipt of statements setting out the amount of Actual Asset Taxes.




 





(B)  


For the Current Tax Period, Seller agrees to immediately forward to Buyer any tax reports and returns received by Seller after Closing and to provide Buyer with any information in Seller’s possession that is necessary for Buyer to timely file any required tax reports and returns.  With respect to taxable periods that include the Effective Time, Buyer shall file all tax returns and reports applicable to the Assets required to be filed after the Closing Date and shall indemnify the Seller against liability for the payment of Asset Taxes with respect to such tax returns and reports and the filing of such tax returns and reports.




 



  



38







  



 

19.2 Tax Reporting.  Prior to Closing, Buyer and Seller shall confer and cooperate in the allocation of the Base Purchase Price among the Properties in accordance with Section 1060 of the Internal Revenue Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (and any similar provision of state, local or foreign law, as appropriate) (the “Allocation”).  Buyer and Seller shall confer and cooperate on any revisions to the Allocation (the “Revised Allocation”) so as to report any matters related to the Allocation that require updating (including adjustments to the Base Purchase Price) to be consistent with the agreed allocation.  Seller and Buyer shall report the transactions contemplated hereby on all tax returns, including, but not limited to Form 8594, in a manner consistent with the Allocation or, if applicable, the Revised Allocation.

 

19.3 Transfer Taxes.  The Parties believe that no sales, transfer or similar tax is applicable to the transactions contemplated herein and, accordingly, no such tax will be collected at Closing from Buyer in connection with this transaction.  If, however, this transaction is later deemed to be subject to sales, transfer or similar tax, for any reason, Buyer agrees to be solely responsible, and shall indemnify and hold Seller (and its affiliates, and its and their directors, officers, employees, attorneys, contractors and agents) harmless, for any and all sales, transfer or other similar taxes (including related penalty, interest or legal costs) due by virtue of this transaction on the Assets transferred pursuant hereto and the Buyer shall remit such taxes at that time.  Seller and Buyer agree to cooperate with each other in demonstrating that the requirements for exemptions from such taxes have been met.

 

19.4 Income and Franchise Taxes.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each Party shall be responsible for its own federal, state, local and foreign income and franchise taxes, if any, that are attributable to its ownership of the Properties or that may result from the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

If, within five (5) years after Closing, Seller decides to negotiate with Chevron U.S.A.

20.2 Indemnification By Buyer.  From and after the Closing, Buyer shall assume, indemnify and hold Seller and its affiliates, and its and their respective directors, officers, employees, attorneys, contractors and agents harmless from and against any and all claims, actions, causes of action, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses (including, without limitation, court costs and consultants’ and attorneys’ fees) of any kind or character (“Damages”) (individually a “Seller’s Indemnified Claim” and collectively “Seller’s Indemnified Claims”) arising out of:

In addition, in no event shall Seller’s aggregate liability arising out of or related to Buyer’s Indemnified Claims exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the Base Purchase Price (the “Indemnity Cap”).

to indemnify, describing in reasonable detail the factual basis for such claim, and shall allow the indemnifying Party to assume and conduct the defense of the claim or action with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee, and shall cooperate with the indemnifying Party in the defense thereof; provided, however, that the omission to give such notice to the indemnifying Party shall not relieve the indemnifying Party from any liability which it may have to the Indemnitee, except to the extent that the indemnifying Party is prejudiced by the failure to give such notice and as otherwise provided in Section 20.5.  The Indemnitee shall have the right to employ separate counsel to represent the Indemnitee if the Indemnitee is advised by counsel that an actual conflict of interest makes it advisable for the Indemnitee to be represented by separate counsel and the reasonable expenses and fees of such separate counsel shall be paid by the indemnifying Party.

 

20.7 Exclusive Remedy.  Upon Closing, the terms and provisions of this Article 20 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of each of the Parties indemnified hereunder with respect to the claims described in Sections 20.2 and 20.3, including, without limitation, claims arising from breaches of the representations and warranties of the Parties set forth in this Agreement and the other documents executed and delivered hereunder, regardless of whether such claims are based on contract, tort, securities laws, strict liability, or other principles.

 

ARTICLE 21

MEDIATION AND ARBITRATION

 

21.1 Mediation and Arbitration.

 





(A)  


If a dispute (other than an accounting dispute subject to Section 3.3 or a dispute subject to Article 7) arises out of or in connection with this Agreement, and if the dispute cannot be settled through negotiation, the Parties agree first to try in good faith to settle the dispute by mediation under the Commercial Mediation Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) before resorting to arbitration under this Section or any other Section in this Agreement.




 





(B)  


Except as provided in Section 21.1(A) and for the accounting dispute procedures of Section 3.3 and the Independent Expert procedures of Article 7, the Parties hereby agree to submit all other controversies, claims and matters of difference arising from or relating to this Agreement (“Disputes”) to arbitration.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following shall be considered Disputes for this purpose:  (1) all questions relating to the interpretation or breach of this Agreement, (2) all questions relating to any representations, negotiations and other proceedings leading to the execution hereof, and (3) all questions as to whether the right to arbitrate any question exists.




 





(C)  


Arbitration may be initiated by a Party (“Claimant”) serving written notice on the other Party (the “Respondent”) that Claimant elects to refer the Dispute to binding arbitration.  Disputes involving claims in an amount less than $500,000.00 shall be determined by a single arbitrator, who shall




 



  



43







  



 






 


be selected by mutual agreement of the Parties.  In the event the Parties are unable to agree within fourteen (14) days on an arbitrator, either Party may request the AAA to appoint an arbitrator, giving due regard to the selection criteria set out below.  Disputes involving claims in an amount of $500,000 or greater shall be determined by a panel of three (3) arbitrators.  Claimant’s notice initiating binding arbitration must identify the arbitrator Claimant has appointed. Respondent shall respond to Claimant within thirty (30) days after receipt of Claimant’s notice, identifying the arbitrator Respondent has appointed. If Respondent fails for any reason to name an arbitrator within the thirty (30) day period, Claimant will name the arbitrator for Respondent’s account. The two (2) arbitrators so chosen shall select a third arbitrator (who must have not less than ten (10) years experience as an oil and gas lawyer) within thirty (30) days after the second arbitrator has been appointed. If the two (2) arbitrators are unable to agree on a third arbitrator within sixty (60) days from initiation of arbitration, then a third arbitrator shall be selected by the AAA office administering the Dispute, with due regard given to the selection criteria above and input from the Parties and other arbitrators. The AAA shall select the third arbitrator not later than ninety (90) days from initiation of arbitration.  In the event AAA should fail to select the third arbitrator within ninety (90) days from initiation of arbitration, then either Party may petition the Chief United States District Judge for the Southern District of Texas to select the third arbitrator.  Due regard shall be given to the selection criteria above and input from the Parties and other arbitrators.




 






(D)  


All matters arbitrated hereunder shall be arbitrated in Houston, Texas, shall be governed by Texas law, without reference to any choice of law rules, and shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA (the “Rules”).  The arbitrators shall conduct a hearing no later than sixty (60) days after submission of the matter to arbitration, and a decision shall be rendered by the arbitrators within fifteen (15) days of the hearing.  At the hearing, the Parties shall present such evidence and witnesses as they may choose, with or without counsel.  Adherence to formal rules of evidence shall not be required but the arbitration panel shall consider any evidence and testimony that it determines to be relevant, in accordance with procedures that it determines to be appropriate.  Any award entered in an arbitration shall be made by a written opinion stating the reasons for the award made.




 





(E)  


This submission and agreement to arbitrate shall be specifically enforceable.  Arbitration may proceed in the absence of any Party if notice of the proceedings has been given to such Party.  The Parties agree to abide by all awards rendered in such proceedings.  Such awards shall be final and binding on all Parties to the extent and in the manner permitted under Texas law.  All awards may be filed with the clerk of one or more courts, state, federal or foreign having jurisdiction over the Party against whom such award is rendered or its property, as a basis of judgment and 




 



  



44







  



 






 


of the issuance of execution for its collection.  No Party shall be considered in default hereunder during the pendency of arbitration proceedings relating to such default, but nothing herein shall be deemed to toll the effectiveness of contract provisions relating to the accruing of or rate of interest on amounts not paid when due.




 






(F)  


The arbitrators may award legal and equitable relief, including but not limited to the award of specific performance.  With regard to the award of damages, the arbitrators are empowered to award only compensatory damages (which term may include attorney’s fees and costs and compensation for the time value of money).  EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF COMPENSATORY DAMAGES, INCLUDING WAIVER OF PUNITIVE AND MULTIPLE DAMAGES.  Nothing herein shall prevent a Party from seeking a preliminary injunction or similar preliminary judicial relief if in the good faith judgment of the Party such action is necessary to avoid irreparable damage.  Such Party must, however, continue to participate in good faith in the dispute resolution proceedings specified in this Section.

22.3 Press Releases and Public Announcements.  No Party shall issue any press release or make any public announcement relating to the subject matter of this Agreement without the prior written approval of the other Party; provided, however, that any Party may make any public disclosure it believes in good faith is required by applicable law or any listing or trading agreement concerning its or its affiliates’ publicly-traded securities (in which case the disclosing

Party shall use all reasonable efforts to advise the other Party, and give the other Party an opportunity to comment on the proposed disclosure, prior to making the disclosure).

 

22.4 COMPLIANCE WITH EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE RULE.  THE PARTIES AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS MAY OTHERWISE BE EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN, THE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS OF THE INDEMNIFYING PARTY SHALL BE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY OF THE INDEMNIFIED PERSON(S), WHETHER THE NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY IS ACTIVE, PASSIVE, JOINT, CONCURRENT OR SOLE.

 

22.5 Governing Law.  This Agreement is governed by and must be construed according to the laws of the State of Texas, excluding any conflicts-of-law rule or principle that might apply the law of another jurisdiction.

 

22.6 Exhibits.  The Exhibits attached to this Agreement are incorporated into and made a part of this Agreement.

 

22.7 Fees, Expenses, and Recording.

 





(A)  


Each Party shall be solely responsible for all costs and expenses incurred by it in connection with this transaction (including, but not limited to fees and expenses of its counsel and accountants) and shall not be entitled to any reimbursements from the other Party, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement.




 





(B)  


Buyer shall, at its own cost, promptly record all instruments of conveyance and sale in the appropriate office of the state and parish offshore which the lands covered by such instrument are located.  Buyer shall promptly file for and obtain the necessary approval of all federal or state government agencies to the assignment of the Assets.  The assignment of any state or federal oil and gas leases shall be filed in the appropriate governmental offices on a form required and in compliance with the applicable rules of the applicable government agencies.  Buyer shall supply Seller with a true and accurate photocopy reflecting the recording information of all the recorded and filed assignments within a reasonable period of time after their recording and filing.




 

22.8 Assignment.  Neither this Agreement nor any part hereof (including without limitation any indemnification rights or any obligations or benefits hereunder) may be assigned by either Party without the prior written consent of the other Party and any transfer in absence of such consent shall be null and void; provided, however, upon notice to the other Party, either Party shall have the right to assign all or part of its rights (but none of its obligations) under this Agreement in order to qualify a transfer of the Assets as a “like-kind” exchange for federal tax purposes.  After Closing, any permitted assignment of this Agreement by a Party shall not relieve such assigning Party of any of its obligations and responsibilities to the non-assigning Party unless expressly released from same in writing by such non-assigning Party.  Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement is binding upon the Parties hereto and their respective successors and 

 



  



47







  



 

assigns.  Notwithstanding the restrictions and requirements of this Section 22.8, prior to Closing, Buyer shall have the right, without Seller’s consent, to assign all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to an affiliate of Buyer, so long as such affiliated assignee of Buyer has the financial ability to perform Buyer’s obligations under this Agreement.  The restrictions on or requirements for assignment in this Section 22.8 shall not limit or apply to Buyer’s (or its successors’ or assigns’) ability to assign all or part of its interest in the Assets after Closing.

 

22.9 Buyer’s Parent as a Party.  Each of Buyer and Seller acknowledges and agrees that Buyer’s Parent is joined in the execution of this Agreement for the sole purpose of ensuring Buyer’s compliance with Section 11.1(G), and Buyer’s Parent shall have no other duties, obligations, responsibilities or liabilities of any kind whatsoever to Seller or otherwise arising out of this Agreement.

 

22.10 Seller’s Parent as a Party.  Each of Buyer and Seller acknowledges and agrees that Seller’s Parent is joined in the execution of this Agreement for the sole purpose of ensuring Seller’s compliance with Section 1.2(N), Section 18.8, Section 18.9, and, only to the extent related thereto, Section 20.5, and Seller’s Parent shall have no other duties, obligations, responsibilities or liabilities of any kind whatsoever to Buyer or otherwise arising out of this Agreement.

 

22.11 Entire Agreement.  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement reached by the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, superseding all prior negotiations, discussions, agreements and understandings, whether oral or written, relating to such subject matter, except the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

 

22.12 Severability.  In the event that any one or more covenants, clauses or provisions of this Agreement shall be held invalid or illegal, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this Agreement.

 

22.13 Captions.  The captions in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not be considered a part of or affect the construction or interpretation of any provision of this Agreement.

 

22.14 Counterpart Execution.  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, and each such counterpart hereof shall be deemed to be an original, and all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

 

22.15 Waiver of Certain Damages.  The indemnification obligations of the Parties under Article 20 shall be limited to actual losses, and shall not include, and each of the Parties hereby waives and agrees not to seek incidental, consequential, indirect, punitive or exemplary damages with respect to any claim, controversy, or dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach thereof, except in the event such damages are awarded to a third party.

 

22.16 Amendments and Waivers.  This Agreement may not be modified or amended except by an instrument in writing signed by both Parties.  Any Party hereto may, only by an instrument in writing, waive compliance by another Party with any term or provision of this Agreement on the part of such other Party hereto to be performed or complied with.  The waiver 

 



  



48







  



 

by any Party hereto of a breach of any term or provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach.

 

22.17 Seller’s Knowledge.  For all purposes of this Agreement, “Seller’s knowledge” or words of similar import shall mean  the actual knowledge of one or more of the following officers of Seller:  Edgar A. Anderson, Mark A. Gregory, Herb Cole, Mike Simon, and Van Goff.

 

22.18 Like-Kind Exchanges.  Buyer shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by Seller, in connection with the transactions contemplated herein to make such modifications as may be necessary, but at no cost or liability to Buyer, to qualify such transactions, in whole or in part, as a “like-kind” exchange pursuant to Section 1031 of the Code.

 

22.19 Further Cooperation.  At the Closing, and thereafter as may be necessary, Seller and Buyer shall execute and deliver such other instruments and documents and take such other actions as may be reasonably necessary to evidence and effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Certificate as to Non-Foreign Status

 

Section 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), provides that a buyer of a U.S. real property interest must withhold tax if the transferor is a “foreign person” as defined in the Code.  For U.S. tax purposes (including section 1445 of the Code), the owner of a disregarded entity (which has legal title to a U.S. real property interest under local law) will be the transferor of the property and not the disregarded entity.  To inform the transferee, Tana Exploration Company LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Buyer”), that withholding of tax is not required upon the disposition by Maritech Resources, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Seller”), of a U.S. real property interest in various offshore Louisiana and Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas leases and related properties, the undersigned hereby certifies the following on behalf of Seller:

 





1.  


Seller is not a foreign corporation, foreign partnership, foreign trust, or foreign estate (as those terms are defined in the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder);




 





2.  


Seller is not a disregarded entity as defined in Treasury Regulation §1.1445-2(b)(2)(iii);




 





3.  


Seller’s U.S. employer identification number is ___________________; and




 





4.  


Seller’s office address is:




 

Maritech Resources, Inc.

24955 Interstate 45 North

The Woodlands, TX 77380




Seller understands that this certification may be disclosed to the Internal Revenue Service by Buyer and that any false statement contained herein could be punished by fine, imprisonment, or both.

 

Under penalties of perjury I, the undersigned, declare that I have examined this certification and to the best of my knowledge and belief it is true, correct and complete, and I further declare that I have authority to sign this document on behalf of Seller.

Gentlemen:




Buyer intends for this letter to serve as an amendment to the PSA.  Capitalized terms not defined in this letter agreement shall have the meanings given in the PSA.




Buyer proposes that the following actions be taken at the Closing of the transaction contemplated by the PSA, in addition to those already called for in the PSA:








1)


Seller will credit to Buyer, at Closing as a Purchase Price Adjustment, an amount equal to $80,960.53, being the total of all “Total Closing Statement Adjustments” for all employees shown on Exhibit 1.

3)


Buyer will credit each employee with or deposit for the benefit of such employee, as applicable, the amount of positive flex spending account (“FSA”) funds indicated for such employee in the column with the heading “FSA Balance to be Transferred to Buyer” on Exhibit 1.  Such credit or deposit in Buyer’s FSA program will be effective immediately upon such employee being eligible for Buyer’s FSA program.







Seller states that it has distributed to all of the employees listed on Exhibit 1 a copy of the Disclosure and PTO Election Form in the form attached as Exhibit 2 to this letter, and all of such forms received by Seller from an employee listed on Exhibit 1 have been delivered to Buyer.




If this correctly reflects Seller’s understanding of Buyer’s and Seller’s agreements regarding the matters covered by this letter agreement, please acknowledge Seller’s agreement to the terms hereof by executing below.

Re:


Third Second Amendment to Purchase and Sale Agreement (“PSA”) dated April 1, 2011 by and between Maritech Resources, Inc. (“Seller”) and Tana Exploration Company LLC (“Buyer”) regarding Employee Related Closing Adjustments




 

Gentlemen:




Buyer intends, subject to Seller’s agreement, for this letter to serve as an amendment to the PSA to reflect certain agreements reached regarding the Assets.  Capitalized terms not defined in this letter agreement shall have the meanings given in the PSA.  Buyer proposes that the following amendments to the PSA be made:








1.  


The following language shall be added to the end of Section 1.1(I) of the PSA: “, including, without limitation, those listed on Exhibit 1.1(I);”.  Exhibit 1.1(I) attached to this letter agreement is agreed to be Exhibit 1.1(I) to the PSA.











2.  


The following language shall be added to the end of Section 3.2 of the PSA:







For purposes of the Closing Adjustment Statement, the estimated amount by which the Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward at Closing pursuant to Section 3.1(B)(i) for the production during the month of May 2011 is $12,994,090.00, and the estimated amount by which the Purchase Price shall be adjusted upward at Closing pursuant to Section 3.1(A)(iii) for costs, expenses or other expenditures related to operations during the month of May 2011 is $3,077,932.62.  To the extent that after Closing and prior to July 15, 2011 Buyer receives proceeds covered by Section 3.1(B)(i) and attributable to production during the month of May 2011, Buyer shall pay such proceeds to Seller on or before July 29, 2011.  To the extent that after Closing and prior to July 15, 2011 Buyer pays for costs, expenses or other expenditures covered by Section 3.1(A)(iii) and attributable to operations during the month of May 2011, Seller shall reimburse Buyer for such costs, expenses and other expenditures on or before July 29, 2011.  Payments due under the two preceding sentences shall be offset to the effect that only one net payment shall be made by the applicable Party for the net amount due.  The adjustments set forth herein are intended to reflect the Parties’ approximation of the May 2011 production revenues and expenses in the Closing Adjustment Statement, but nothing herein shall otherwise affect the procedure set forth in Sections 3.1 and Section 3.3 for purposes of calculating the Post-Closing Adjustment Statement.








3.  


Section 18.10 of the PSA shall be amended by replacing “, at a market rate per square foot on a month-to-month basis for up to eighteen (18) months, with such other terms as are standard for commercial office space leases for comparable space in the area” with “on the terms and conditions reflected in the Leases Agreement attached as Exhibit 18.10.”  Exhibit 18.10 attached to this letter agreement is agreed to be Exhibit 18.10 to the PSA.











4.  


The existing Exhibits and Schedules to the PSA referenced in Exhibit A to this letter agreement shall be amended as noted in such Exhibit A.











5.  


The Parties agree the Seismic Micro-Technology, Inc.’s Software License Assignment Agreement (the “License Assignment”) attached to this letter agreement as a part of Exhibit B shall be executed by the Parties at Closing.  Seller represents and warrants that the Maintenance Fee(s) (as defined in the License Assignment) and any transfer and administrative fees applicable to the License Assignment or the underlying licenses are current and paid in full or will be paid in full within five (5) days after Closing.  Seller further agrees and acknowledges that the total amount due under the “Purchase Letter” attached to this letter agreement as a part of Exhibit B and all amounts due as administrative fees applicable to the License Assignment or the underlying licenses are included in the $133,551.76 paid to Seller by Buyer at Closing, and any portion of such amount due and payable to Seismic Micro-Technology, Inc. shall be paid by Seller within five (5) days after Closing.




 
 

If this correctly reflects Seller’s understanding of Buyer’s and Seller’s agreements regarding the matters covered by this letter agreement, please acknowledge Seller’s agreement to the terms hereof by executing below.

Re:


Third Amendment to Purchase and Sale Agreement (“PSA”) dated April 1, 2011 by and between Maritech Resources, Inc. (”Seller”) and Tana Exploration Company LLC (“Buyer”)







Gentlemen:




Buyer intends for this letter to serve as an amendment to the PSA.  Capitalized terms not defined in this letter agreement shall have the meanings given in the PSA.




Section 20.1(E) of the PSA contemplates that Buyer will substitute the Buyer’s Letter of Credit in place of Seller’s Parent Letter of Credit on or before the Closing, and in such case the Base Purchase Price will be reduced by $2,000,000.  Section 20.1(E) further provides that if the Buyer’s Letter of Credit does not replace Seller’s Parent Letter of Credit on or before the Closing, the Base Purchase Price will be increased by $750,000.




Buyer has not substituted the Buyer’s Letter of Credit, but believes it will be able to do so very soon.  Accordingly the Parties have agreed to close the transaction contemplated by the PSA using a Base Purchase Price reduced by $2,000,000.  The Parties will cooperate with one another in an effort to obtain Chevron’s agreement to accept the substitution of the Buyer’s Letter of Credit; provided, however, that if Seller has not received notification that the Seller’s Parent Letter of Credit has been terminated by Tuesday, June 14, 2011 at 5:00 PM, then upon request by Seller, Buyer shall pay by wire transfer to an account specified by Seller the amount of $2,750,000 by not later than Wednesday, June 15, 2011.  Except as modified herein, Section 20.1(E) of the PSA remains in full force and effect.




If this correctly reflects Seller’s understanding of Buyer’s and Seller’s agreements regarding the matters covered by this letter agreement, please acknowledge Seller’s agreement to the terms hereof by executing below.
