3.2      Representations and Warranties of each Purchaser.  Each Purchaser, severally and not jointly, represents and warrants with respect to only itself, as of the Closing Date, that:

 

(a)           The Purchaser is either an individual or an entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Legal Requirements of the jurisdiction of its organization with full right, corporate, partnership or limited liability company power and authority to enter into and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to carry out its obligations hereunder.  The execution and delivery of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party, and the performance by the Purchaser of the transactions contemplated by such Transaction Documents, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate, partnership, limited liability company or similar action, as applicable, on the part of the Purchaser.  Each of the Transaction Documents to which the Purchaser is a party has been duly executed by the Purchaser, and when delivered by the Purchaser in accordance with the terms of such Transaction Document, will constitute the valid and legally binding obligation of the Purchaser, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except: (i) as limited by general equitable principles and applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other laws of general application affecting enforcement of creditors’ rights generally, (ii) as limited by laws relating to the availability of specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies and (iii) insofar as indemnification and contribution provisions may be limited by applicable law.

 

(b)           The execution, delivery and performance by the Purchaser of each of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party, and the consummation by the Purchaser of the transactions contemplated by each such Transaction Document, do not and will not (i) conflict with or violate any provision of the Purchaser’s certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational or charter documents, or (ii) conflict with or result in a violation of any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, injunction, decree or other restriction of any court or Governmental Entity to which the Purchaser is subject (including federal and state securities laws and regulations), or by which any property or asset of the Purchaser is bound or affected.

 

(c)           The Purchaser is acquiring the Securities as principal for its own account and not with a view to or for distributing or reselling such Securities or any part thereof in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable state securities law, has no present intention of




  



21







  




distributing any of such Securities in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable state securities law and has no direct or indirect arrangement or understandings with any other persons to distribute or regarding the distribution of such Units in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable state securities law (this representation and warranty not limiting the Purchaser’s right to sell the Securities or any part thereof in compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws).  The Purchaser is acquiring the Securities hereunder in the ordinary course of its business.

 

(d)           Other than consummating the transactions contemplated hereunder, the Purchaser has not, nor has any Person acting on behalf of or pursuant to any understanding with the Purchaser, directly or indirectly executed any purchases or sales, including Short Sales, of the securities of the Company during the period commencing as of the time that the Purchaser first became aware of the proposed transactions contemplated hereunder and ending immediately prior to the execution hereof.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of a Purchaser that is a multi-managed investment vehicle whereby separate portfolio managers manage separate portions of the Purchaser’s assets and the portfolio managers have no direct knowledge of the investment decisions made by the portfolio managers managing other portions of the Purchaser’s assets, the representation set forth above shall only apply with respect to the portion of assets managed by the portfolio manager that made the investment decision to purchase the Units covered by this Agreement.  Other than to other Persons party to this Agreement and its Affiliates and their respective investment advisors, agents, counsel and other advisors, the Purchaser has maintained the confidentiality of all disclosures made to it in connection with this transaction (including the existence and terms of this transaction). Notwithstanding the foregoing, for avoidance of doubt, nothing contained herein shall constitute a representation or warranty, or preclude any actions, with respect to the identification of the availability of, or securing of, available shares to borrow in order to effect Short Sales or similar transactions in the future.

 

(e)           At the time such Purchaser was offered the Securities, it was, and as of the date hereof it is, and on each date on which it exercises any Warrants, it will be either: (i) an “accredited investor” as defined in Rule 501 under the Securities Act or (ii) a “qualified institutional buyer” as defined in Rule 144A(a) under the Securities Act.  Such Purchaser is not required to be registered as a broker-dealer under Section 15 of the Exchange Act. Such Purchaser, either alone or together with its representatives, has such knowledge, sophistication and experience in business and financial matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the prospective investment in the Securities and has so evaluated the merits and risks of such investment.  Such Purchaser is able to bear the economic risk of an investment in the Securities and, at the present time, is able to afford a complete loss of such investment.

 

(f)           Such Purchaser understands that the Securities are being offered and sold to it in reliance on specific exemptions from the registration requirements of United States federal and state securities laws and that the Company is relying in part upon the truth and accuracy of, and such Purchaser’s compliance with, the representations, warranties, agreements, acknowledgments and understandings of such Purchaser set forth herein in order to determine the availability of such exemptions and the eligibility of such Purchaser to acquire the Securities.

 

(g)           Such Purchaser and its advisors, if any, have been furnished with all materials relating to the business, finances and operations of the Company and materials relating to the offer and sale of the Securities that have been requested by such Purchaser.  Such Purchaser and its advisors, if any, in acquiring the Securities, have relied solely on their independent investigation of the Company and have been afforded the opportunity to ask questions of the Company.  Neither such inquiries nor any other due diligence investigations conducted by such Purchaser or its advisors, if any, or its representatives shall modify, amend or affect such Purchaser’s right to rely on the Company’s representations and warranties contained herein.  Purchaser is not relying on any oral or written representation or statement made by the Company other than those contained herein, in the other Transaction Documents and in the Commission Reports.  Such Purchaser understands that its investment in the Securities involves a high degree of risk.  Such Purchaser has sought such accounting, legal and tax advice as it has considered necessary to make an informed investment decision with respect to its acquisition of the Securities.

(h)           Such Purchaser understands that no United States federal or state agency or any other government or Governmental Entity has passed on or made any recommendation or endorsement of the Securities or the fairness or suitability of the investment in the Securities nor have such authorities passed upon or endorsed the merits of the offering of the Securities.

 

(i)            Such Purchaser is a resident of that jurisdiction specified beneath the Purchaser’s name on the signature pages hereto.

 

(j)            Such Purchaser understands that except as provided in the Registration Rights Agreement: (i) the Securities have not been and are not being registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws, and may not be offered for sale, sold, assigned or transferred unless (A) subsequently registered thereunder, (B) such Purchaser shall have delivered to the Company an opinion of counsel, in a generally acceptable form, to the effect that such Securities to be sold, assigned or transferred may be sold, assigned or transferred pursuant to an exemption from such registration, or (C) such Purchaser provides the Company with reasonable assurance that such Securities can be sold, assigned or transferred pursuant to Rule 144 or Rule 144A promulgated under the Securities Act (or a successor rule thereto) (collectively, “Rule 144”); (ii) any sale of the Securities made in reliance on Rule 144 may be made only in accordance with the terms of Rule 144 and further, if Rule 144 is not applicable, any resale of the Securities under circumstances in which the seller (or the Person through whom the sale is made) may be deemed to be an underwriter (as that term is defined in the Securities Act) may require compliance with some other exemption under the Securities Act or the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder; and (iii) neither the Company nor any other Person is under any obligation to register the Securities under the Securities Act or any state securities laws or to comply with the terms and conditions of any exemption thereunder.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Securities may be pledged in connection with a bona fide margin account or other loan or financing arrangement secured by the Securities and such pledge of Securities shall not be deemed to be a transfer, sale or assignment of the Securities hereunder, and no Purchaser effecting a pledge of Securities shall be required to provide the Company with any notice thereof or otherwise make any delivery to the Company pursuant to this Agreement or any other Transaction Document.

 

(k)           Such Purchaser understands that the Securities are “restricted securities” and that the certificates or other instruments representing the Securities shall, until such time as the resale of the Common Shares and Warrant Shares have been registered under the Securities Act as contemplated by the Registration Rights Agreement, shall bear any applicable legend as required by the “blue sky” laws of any state and a restrictive legend in substantially the following form (and a stop-transfer order may be placed against transfer of such stock certificates):

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “SECURITIES ACT”), OR APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS.  THE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE OFFERED FOR SALE, SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR ASSIGNED (I) IN THE ABSENCE OF (A) AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR THE SECURITIES UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, OR (B) AN OPINION OF COUNSEL, IN A GENERALLY ACCEPTABLE FORM, THAT REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER SAID ACT (II) UNLESS SOLD OR TRANSFERRED TO A “QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER” WITHIN THE MEANING OF RULE 144A UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR (III) UNLESS SOLD PURSUANT TO RULE 144 OR RULE 144A UNDER SAID ACT.  NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE SECURITIES MAY BE PLEDGED IN CONNECTION WITH A BONA FIDE MARGIN ACCOUNT OR OTHER LOAN OR FINANCING ARRANGEMENT SECURED BY THE SECURITIES.

 

(l)            Such Purchaser acknowledges to the Placement Agent that the Placement Agent is acting as placement agent for the Units being offered hereby and will be compensated by the Company for acting in such capacity.  Such Purchaser further acknowledges that the Placement Agent has acted solely as placement agent in connection with the offering of the Units by the Company, that the information and data provided to such Purchaser in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby have not been subjected to independent verification or investigation by the Placement Agent, and that the Placement Agent makes no representation or warranty with respect to the accuracy or completeness of such information, data or other related disclosure material, nor shall the Placement Agent or any of its directors, officers, employees, representatives, controlling persons or agents be liable for any loss or damages of any kind resulting from the use of such information, data or related disclosure material except as set forth below.  Such Purchaser further acknowledges that in making its decision to enter into this Agreement and purchase the Units, it has not relied on information provided by the Placement Agent but has conducted its own investigation and has relied on its own examination of the Company and the terms of, and consequences, of holding the Securities.  Such Purchaser further acknowledges that the provisions of this Section 3.2(l) are for the benefit of, and may be enforced by, and only by, the Placement Agent and the Company to the extent applicable.

 

(m)           Such Purchaser is not purchasing the Securities as a result of any advertisement, article, notice or other communication regarding the Securities published in any newspaper, magazine or similar media or broadcast over television or radio or presented at any seminar or any other general solicitation or general advertisement.

 

The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Purchaser does not make or has not made any representations or warranties with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby other than those specifically set forth in this Section 3.2.

4.2      Non-Public Information.  Except with respect to the material terms and conditions of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement which will subsequently become public information in accordance with Section 4.1, the Company covenants and agrees that neither it, nor any other Person acting on its behalf, will provide the Purchasers or their agents or counsel with any information that the Company believes constitutes material non-public information, unless prior thereto each of the Purchasers shall have executed a written agreement with the Company regarding the confidentiality and use of such information.  The Company understands and confirms that the Purchasers shall be relying on the foregoing covenant in effecting transactions in securities of the Company.

 

4.3      Use of Proceeds.  The Company shall use the net proceeds from the sale of the Units hereunder for general business and working capital purposes. The Company shall not use such proceeds for the redemption of any Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents.

 

4.4      Indemnification of Purchaser.  Subject to the provisions of this Section 4.4 and to the extent permitted by law, the Company will indemnify and hold the Purchaser, its Affiliates, and their respective directors, managers, officers, stockholders, members, partners, employees and agents (and any other Persons with a functionally equivalent role of a Person holding such titles notwithstanding a lack of such title or any other title), each Person who controls the Purchaser (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act), and the directors, managers, officers, stockholders, agents, members, partners, employees and agents (and any other Persons with a functionally equivalent role of a Person holding such titles notwithstanding a lack of such title or any other title) of such controlling persons (each, a “Purchaser Party”) harmless from any and all losses, liabilities, obligations, contingencies, damages, costs and expenses, including all judgments, amounts paid in settlements, court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of investigation (“Damages”) that any Purchaser Party may suffer or incur due to a claim by a third party as a result of or relating to (a) any breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements made by the Company in this Agreement or (b) any action instituted against a Purchaser in any capacity, or any of them or their respective Affiliates, by any stockholder of the Company who is not an Affiliate of the Purchaser Party, with respect to any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (except to the extent such Damages are based upon a breach of the Purchaser’s representations, warranties or covenants under this Agreement or any agreements or understandings the Purchaser Party may have with any such stockholder or any violations by the Purchaser Party of state or federal securities laws or any conduct by the Purchaser which constitutes fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct or malfeasance).  If any action shall be brought against the Purchaser Party in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to this Agreement, the Purchaser Party shall promptly notify the Company in writing, and the Company shall have the right to assume the defense thereof with counsel of its own choosing reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser Party.  The Purchaser Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Purchaser Party except to the extent that (i) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the Company in writing, (ii) the Company has failed after a reasonable period of time to assume such defense and to employ counsel or (iii) in such action there is, in the reasonable opinion of counsel, a material conflict on any material issue between the position of the Company and the position of the Purchaser Party, in which case the Company shall be responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses of no more than one such separate counsel (together with any necessary local counsel).  The Company will not be liable to the Purchaser Party under this Agreement (y) for any settlement by a Purchaser Party effected without the Company’s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; or (z) to the extent, but only to the extent that a loss, claim, damage or liability is attributable to the Purchaser Party’s breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements made by the Purchaser Party in this Agreement.  The Company will not settle any such claim, action or proceeding without the prior written consent of the Purchaser Party, which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, however, that such consent shall not be required if the settlement includes a full and unconditional release satisfactory to the Purchaser Party from all liability arising or that may arise out of such claim or proceeding and does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of the Purchaser Party.

 



  



25







  



 

4.5      Reservation of Common Stock.  As of the date hereof, the Company has reserved and the Company shall continue to reserve and keep available at all times, free of any Liens, a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock for the purpose of enabling the Company to issue shares of Common Stock issued (i) as part of the Units purchased pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) upon the exercise of the Warrants issued as part of the Units purchased pursuant to this Agreement.

 

4.6      Reporting Status.  Until the earlier of (i) the date on which the Purchaser shall have sold all of the Securities and (ii) the date on which the Purchaser may sell all of the Securities without restriction pursuant to Rule 144 and without the requirement to be in compliance with Rule 144(c)(1) (or any successor thereto) promulgated under the Securities Act (the “Reporting Period”), the Company shall timely file all reports required to be filed with the Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act, and the Company shall not terminate its status as an issuer required to file reports under the Exchange Act even if the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder would no longer require or otherwise permit such termination.

 

4.7      Equal Treatment of Purchaser.  The sale and purchase of the Units to a Purchaser under this Agreement is, and shall be, on the same terms and conditions offered all other Purchasers of the Units in the Offering.  If the Company offers better terms to any other purchaser of Units in the Offering than are being offered to the Purchasers under this Agreement, including, without limitation, by amendment or modification to this Agreement or otherwise, then the Company shall offer to sell the Units to the Purchaser on the same terms.

 

4.8      Certain Transactions and Confidentiality. Each Purchaser covenants that neither it nor any Affiliate acting on its behalf or pursuant to any understanding with it will execute any purchases or sales, including Short Sales, of any of the Company’s securities during the period commencing with the execution of this Agreement and ending at such time that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are first publicly announced pursuant to the initial press release as described in Section 4.1.  Each Purchaser covenants that until such time as the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are publicly disclosed by the Company pursuant to the initial press release as described in Section 4.1, such Purchaser will maintain the confidentiality of the existence and terms of this transaction.  Notwithstanding the foregoing and notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company expressly acknowledges and agrees that (i) no Purchaser makes any representation, warranty or covenant hereby that it will not engage in effecting transactions in any securities of the Company after the time that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are first publicly announced pursuant to the initial press release as described in Section 4.1, (ii) no Purchaser shall be restricted or prohibited from effecting any transactions in any securities of the Company in accordance with applicable securities laws from and after the time that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are first publicly announced pursuant to the initial press release as described in Section 4.1 and (iii) no Purchaser shall have any duty of confidentiality to the Company or its subsidiaries after the issuance of the initial press release as described in Section 4.1.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of a Purchaser that is a multi-managed investment vehicle whereby separate portfolio managers manage separate portions of the Purchaser’s assets and the portfolio managers have no direct knowledge of the investment decisions made by the portfolio managers managing other portions of the Purchaser’s assets, the covenants and agreements set forth in the first two sentences of this Section 4.8 shall only apply with respect to the portion of assets managed by the portfolio manager that made the investment decision to purchase the Securities covered by this Agreement.

4.9      Right of First Refusal.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 4.9, if the Company proposes to offer or sell any newly issued shares of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents in a transaction the principal purpose of which is to raise equity capital (collectively, “New Securities”), the Company shall first offer such New Securities to the Purchasers (the “Offer”) subject to each Purchaser’s pro rata equity investment in the Offering.

 

(a)         The Company shall give notice (the “Offer Notice”) to the Purchasers, stating (i) its bona fide intention to offer such New Securities, (ii) the number of such New Securities to be offered, and (iii) the price and terms, if any, upon which it proposes to offer such New Securities.

 

(b)         To accept an Offer, in whole or in part, a Purchaser must deliver a written notice (“Notice of Acceptance”) to the Company prior to the end of the second (2nd) Trading Day after such Purchaser’s receipt of the Offer Notice (the “Offer Period”), setting forth the amount of New Securities that such Purchaser elects to purchase or otherwise acquire (at the price and on the terms specified in the Offer Notice), which amount can be up to that portion of the New Securities equal to the Purchaser’s pro rata equity investment in the Offering (provided, for purposes of this Section 4.9, the Purchaser’s “pro rata equity investment in the Offering” shall mean the ratio of (i) the total number of shares of Units held by the Purchaser to (ii) the total number of Units sold by the Company in the Offering).

 

(c)         The Company shall have 60 days after expiration of the Offer Period to sell or enter into an agreement (pursuant to which the sale of New Securities covered thereby shall be closed, if at all, within 30 days from the date of said agreement) to sell all or any part of such New Securities as to which a Notice of Acceptance has not been given by a Purchaser (the “Refused Securities”), but only to the offerees described in the Offer Notice (if so described therein) and only upon terms and conditions that are not more favorable to the acquiring person or persons or less favorable to the Company than those set forth in the Offer Notice.

 

(d)         Upon the closing of the issuance, sale or exchange of all or less than all of the Refused Securities, a Purchaser shall acquire from the Company, and the Company shall issue to such Purchaser, the number or amount of New Securities specified in the Notice of Acceptance, upon the terms and conditions specified in the Offer. The purchase by a Purchaser of any Offered Securities is subject in all cases to the preparation, execution and delivery by the Company and such Purchaser of a purchase agreement relating to such New Securities reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Company and such Purchaser.

 

(e)         In the event that all of the Purchasers executing this Agreement elect, in the aggregate, to tender a Notice of Acceptance with respect to all of the New Securities described in an Offer Notice, then the Company and each such Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to consummate the purchase and sale of such New Securities as expeditiously as possible, but in no event later than 30 days following the expiration of the Offer Period.

 

(f)         The right of first refusal in this Section 4.9 shall not apply in connection with the issuance of any Excluded Securities.

 

(g)         The obligations of the Company under this Section 4.9 shall terminate on the earlier to occur of the following: (i) a sale, merger, consolidation or reorganization of the Company; or (ii) the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date.

 

(h)         The right of first refusal set forth in this Section 4.9 is nonassignable, except that (a) such right is assignable by a Purchaser to any Affiliate of the Purchaser, (b) upon the death of any individual Purchaser, such right shall pass to the beneficiaries under the deceased Purchaser’s last will and testament or to the distributees of the deceased Purchaser’s estate, and (c) such right is assignable by a partnership or limited liability company to its partners or members, as applicable.

4.10           Integration.  The Company shall not sell, offer for sale or solicit offers to buy or otherwise negotiate in respect of any security (as defined in Section 2 of the Securities Act) that would be integrated with the offer or sale of the Securities to the Purchasers in a manner that would require the registration under the Securities Act of the sale of the Securities to the Purchasers.

 

4.11           Transfer Restrictions. The Securities may only be disposed of in compliance with state and federal securities laws. In connection with any transfer of Securities other than pursuant to an effective registration statement, to the Company or to an affiliate of a Purchaser or to an entity managed by a Purchaser (provided, in such case the prospective transferee agrees in all such instances in writing to be subject to the terms hereof to the same extent as if he or she were an original Purchaser hereunder), the Company may require the transferor thereof to provide to the Company an opinion of counsel, the form and substance of which opinion shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to the effect that such transfer does not require registration of such transferred Securities under the Securities Act. As a condition of transfer, any such transferee shall agree in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement and shall have the rights of a Purchaser under this Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement.

 

ARTICLE V.

After the Closing, no provision of this Agreement may be waived, modified, supplemented or amended except in a written instrument signed, in the case of an amendment, by the Company and the Purchasers holding at least 50% of the outstanding Securities or, in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom enforcement of any such waived provision is sought.  No waiver of any default with respect to any provision, condition or requirement of this Agreement shall be deemed to be a continuing waiver in the future or a waiver of any subsequent default or a waiver of any other provision, condition or requirement hereof, nor shall any delay or omission of any party to exercise any right hereunder in any manner impair the exercise of any such right.

 



  



28







  



 

5.6      Headings.  The headings herein are for convenience only, do not constitute a part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or affect any of the provisions hereof.

5.8      No Third-Party Beneficiaries.  This Agreement is intended for the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns and the Purchaser Parties (with respect to Section 4.4) and is not for the benefit of, nor may any provision hereof be enforced by, any other Person.

 

5.9      Governing Law.  All questions concerning the construction, validity, enforcement and interpretation of this Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Texas, without regard to the principles of conflicts of law thereof, and federal law, if applicable.  Each party agrees that all legal proceedings concerning the interpretations, enforcement and defense of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (whether brought against a party hereto or its respective Affiliates, directors, officers, stockholders, employees or agents) shall be commenced exclusively in the state and federal courts sitting in the City of Austin. Each party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts sitting in the City of Austin for the adjudication of any dispute hereunder or in connection herewith or with any transaction contemplated hereby or discussed herein, and hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert in any suit, action or proceeding, any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of any such court, that such suit, action or proceeding is improper or is an inconvenient venue for such proceeding.  Each party hereby irrevocably waives personal service of process and consents to process being served in any such suit, action or proceeding by mailing a copy thereof via registered or certified mail or overnight delivery (with evidence of delivery) to such party at the address in effect for notices to it under this Agreement and agrees that such service shall constitute good and sufficient service of process and notice thereof.  Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to limit in any way any right to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.  If either party shall commence an action or proceeding to enforce any provisions of this Agreement, then the prevailing party in such action or proceeding shall be reimbursed by the other party for its reasonable attorneys’ fees and other costs and expenses incurred with the investigation, preparation and prosecution of such action or proceeding.

5.11           Severability.  If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions set forth herein shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and the parties hereto shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to find and employ an alternative means to achieve the same or substantially the same result as that contemplated by such term, provision, covenant or restriction. It is hereby stipulated and declared to be the intention of the parties that they would have executed the remaining terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions without including any of such that may be hereafter declared invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable.

 

5.12           Replacement of Certificates.  If any certificate evidencing the securities issued or issuable hereunder is mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, the Company shall issue or cause to be issued in exchange and substitution for and upon cancellation thereof (in the case of mutilation), or in lieu of and substitution therefor, a new certificate, but only upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company of such loss, theft or destruction and customary and reasonable indemnity or security, if requested.  The applicant for a new certificate under such circumstances shall also pay any reasonable third-party costs (including customary indemnity) associated with the issuance of such replacement certificates.

 

5.13           Remedies.  In addition to being entitled to exercise all rights provided herein or granted by law, including recovery of damages, each of the Purchasers and the Company will be entitled to specific performance under this Agreement.  The parties agree that monetary damages may not be adequate compensation for any loss incurred by reason of any breach of obligations contained in this Agreement and hereby agree to waive and not to assert in any action for specific performance of any such obligation the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate.

 

5.14           Construction.  The parties agree that each of them and/or their respective counsel has reviewed and had an opportunity to revise this Agreement and, therefore, the normal rule of construction to the effect that any ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall not be employed in the interpretation of this Agreement or any amendments hereto.  In addition, each and every reference to share prices and shares of capital stock in this Agreement shall be subject to adjustment for reverse and forward stock splits, stock dividends, stock combinations and other similar transactions of the Common Stock that occur after the date of this Agreement.

 

5.15           WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.  IN ANY ACTION, SUIT, OR PROCEEDING IN ANY JURISDICTION BROUGHT BY ANY PARTY AGAINST ANY OTHER PARTY, THE PARTIES EACH KNOWINGLY AND INTENTIONALLY, TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, HEREBY ABSOLUTELY, UNCONDITIONALLY, IRREVOCABLY AND EXPRESSLY WAIVES FOREVER TRIAL BY JURY.

 

5.16           Survival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements. All representations and warranties made by the Company and each of the Purchasers herein will survive the execution of this Agreement, the Closing and the delivery to the Purchasers of the Units being purchased and the payment therefor until the first anniversary of the Closing Date, except for those representations and warranties which speak as of a specific date.  All covenants and other agreements set forth in this Agreement shall survive the Closing for the respective periods set forth therein and if no such period is specified until the first anniversary of the Closing Date.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Sections 4.1, 4.4, and 5.5 shall survive for the applicable statute of limitations.

 

5.17           Independent Nature of Purchasers’ Obligations and Rights.  The obligations of each Purchaser under any Transaction Document are several and not joint with the obligations of any other Purchaser, and no Purchaser shall be responsible in any way for the performance or non-performance of the obligations of any other Purchaser under any Transaction Document.  Nothing contained herein or in any other Transaction Document, and no action taken by any Purchaser pursuant thereto, shall be deemed to constitute the Purchasers as a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any other kind of entity, or create a presumption that the Purchasers are in any way acting in concert or as a group with respect to such obligations or the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents.  Each Purchaser shall be entitled to independently protect and enforce its rights, including, without limitation, the rights arising out of this Agreement or out of the other Transaction Documents, and it shall not be necessary for any other Purchaser to be joined as an additional party in any proceeding for such purpose.  Each Purchaser has been represented by its own separate legal counsel in their review and negotiation of the Transaction Documents.  For reasons of administrative convenience only, Purchasers and their respective counsel have chosen to communicate with the Company through K&L Gates LLP.  K&L Gates LLP does not represent any of the Purchasers, but rather only the Placement Agent.
