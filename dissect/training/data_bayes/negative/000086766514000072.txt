B.

C. Said Note and Deed of Trust Liens having been previously modified by that one   certain Second Modification, Renewal and Extension of Promissory Note and Deed of Trust   Liens dated to be effective March 13, 2013 and filed of record in Document No. 20130068021,   Official Public Records of Real Property of Bexar County, Texas.      D. Borrower has requested that Lender modify certain provisions of the Note, as   hereinafter provided, and in consideration thereof Borrower has made certain agreements with   Lender as hereinafter more fully set forth.      E. Lender has agreed to such requests, subject to the terms and conditions set forth   herein.      NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of Ten and No/100 Dollars ($10.00) and   other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby     

 





2      acknowledged and agreed, Borrower and Lender hereby agree as follows:      1. Acknowledgment of Outstanding Balance of Note. The parties hereto acknowledge   that the outstanding principal balance of the Note is FOUR MILLION SIX HUNDRED THIRTY-   EIGHT THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY-SEVEN AND 06/100 DOLLARS   ($4,638,727.06).      2. Maturity Date: The Maturity Date under the Note is July 13, 2023 (the “Maturity   Date”).       3. Annual Interest Rate on Unpaid Principal from Date:  Until  July 13, 2018, the   Note shall bear interest, except on past due sums, at a per annum rate equal to the lesser of   FOUR AND ONE-QUARTER OF ONE PERCENT (4.25%) fixed, or the Maximum Lawful Rate   (as hereinafter defined) permitted by applicable law. Beginning August 13, 2018 and thereafter   during the term hereof, the Note, the interest rate shall adjust to the then current Prime Rate   plus ONE PERCENT (1.0%), floating, or the Maximum Lawful Rate permitted by applicable law,   provided however that the interest rate shall never be less than FOUR AND ONE-QUARTER   OF ONE PERCENT (4.25%) per annum, nor more than SEVEN AND ONE-QUARTER OF ONE   PERCENT (7.25%) per annum. Interest shall be calculated on the basis of a three hundred sixty   (360) day year and the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day, but excluding the   last day), unless such rate would result in a usurious rate, in which case, interest shall be   calculated on the basis of three hundred sixty-five (365) or three hundred sixty-six (366) days,   as appropriate.  "Prime Rate" as used herein shall mean the rate of interest publicly announced   as the prime lending rate on corporate loans at large U.S. money center commercial banks, as   published on the each business day in the Southwest Edition of the Wall Street Journal.  In the   event that the Wall Street Journal ceases to be published or ceases to publish such prime rate,   then the "Prime Rate" shall thereafter be the prime rate published or announced each business   day in the largest newspaper of general circulation in San Antonio, Texas.  Without notice to the   Borrower or any other person, the Prime Rate shall automatically fluctuate.  It is expressly   agreed and understood that the Prime Rate is an index chosen by Lender as a general   reference rate of interest, taking into account such factors as Lender may deem appropriate, it   being understood that many of Lender's commercial or other loans are priced in relation to the   Prime Rate, that the use of the Prime Rate is not to be construed as a warranty or   representation that such rate is more favorable than another rate or index, that rates on other   loans or credit facilities may be based on indices other than on the Prime Rate, or that rates on   loans to others may be made below the Prime Rate.    4. Annual Interest Rate on Matured, Unpaid Amounts:  All past due sums, including   principal and interest of this Note, whether due as the result of acceleration of maturity or   otherwise, shall bear interest at the Maximum Lawful Rate, or if applicable law shall not provide   for a Maximum Lawful Rate, at a rate per annum equal to the eighteen percent (18.0%) from the   date the payment thereof shall have become due until the same have been fully discharged by   payment.  In addition, Lender may charge and collect a late fee of five percent (5.0%) of any   scheduled installment that is ten (10) days past due, except for the payment due at maturity.    5. Modification of Payments. From and after the effective date of this Agreement,   principal and interest shall be due and payable under the Note as follows:       Principal and accrued interest payments in the amount of THIRTY-FOUR THOUSAND   THREE HUNDRED FIFTY-THREE AND 89/100 DOLLARS ($34,353.89) each, are due and     

 





3      payable monthly beginning on or before one month after the effective date hereof and   continuing regularly and monthly thereafter on the same day of each month until July 13, 2018.   Borrower acknowledges that the initial payment amount has been computed based on the   annual interest rate in effect on the date hereof amortized over a period of one hundred eighty-   four (184) months.  Beginning August 13, 2018, the monthly principal and accrued interest   payments will adjust based on the interest rate in effect on that date, based on the same one   hundred eighty-four (184) month amortization, and will be due and payable monthly on the   same day of each month until July 13, 2023 (the “Maturity Date”).  At that time, the entire   amount of principal and accrued interest remaining unpaid will be payable. Interest will be   calculated on the unpaid principal to the date of each payment made.  Payments will be credited   first to accrued unpaid interest and then to reduction of principal.      6. Usury.  No provisions of this Agreement or the Note or any instrument evidencing or   securing the Note, or otherwise relating to the indebtedness evidenced by the Note, shall   require the payment or permit the collection, application or receipt of interest in excess of the   maximum permitted by applicable state or federal law. If any excess of interest in such respect   is herein or in any such other instrument provided for, or shall be adjudicated to be so provided   for herein or in any such instrument, the provisions of this paragraph shall govern and neither   Borrower nor any endorsers of the Note nor their respective heirs or personal representatives   shall be obligated to pay the amount of such interest to the extent it is in excess of the amount   permitted by applicable law. It is expressly stipulated and agreed to be the intent of Borrower   and Lender to at all times comply with the usury and other laws relating to the Note, the Deed of   Trust, and any subsequent revisions, repeals or judicial interpretations thereof; to the extent   applicable thereto. In the event Lender or other holder of the Note ever receives, collects or   applies as interest any such excess, such amount which would be excessive interest shall be   applied to the reduction of the unpaid principal balance of the Note, and, if upon such   application the principal balance of the Note is paid in full, any remaining excess shall be   forthwith paid to Borrower and the provisions of the Note or the Deed of Trust shall immediately   be deemed reformed and the amounts thereafter collectable thereunder reduced, without the   necessity of execution of any new document, so as to comply with the then applicable law, but   so as to permit the recovery of the fullest amount otherwise called for thereunder. In determining   whether or not the interest paid or payable under any specific contingency exceeds the   maximum interest allowed to be charged by applicable law, Borrower and Lender or other   holder hereof shall, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, amortize, prorate,   allocate and spread the total amount of interest throughout the entire term of the Note so that   the amount or rate of interest charged for any and all periods of time during the term of the Note   is to the greatest extent possible less than the maximum amount or rate of interest allowed to be   charged by law during the relevant period of time. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, if at any   time applicable laws shall be changed so as to permit a higher rate or amount of interest to be   charged than that permitted prior to such change, then unless prohibited by law, references in   the Note to “applicable law” for purposes of determining the maximum interest or rate of interest   that can be charged shall be deemed to refer to such applicable law as so amended to allow the   greater amount or rate of interest.      7. Release and Waiver of Usury Claims. In consideration of the benefits received by   Borrower hereunder, Borrower hereby waives, releases and terminates all claims, or right to   claim, whether known or unknown, that Lender has charged, collected or received usurious   interest under the Note or the Deed of Trust and hereby waives and releases any right or power   to bring any claim against Lender for usury or to pursue any cause of action against Lender   based on any claim or usury.     

 





4         8. Reaffirmation of Representations, Etc. Borrower hereby reaffirms to Lender each of   the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of Borrower set forth in the Note   and the Deed of Trust.       9. Federal Small Business Certification.  Borrower represents, warrants and certifies,   that none of the principals of Borrower or Borrower’s affiliates have been convicted of, or   pleaded nolo contender to, any offense covered by 42 U.S.C. §16911(7).

Enforceable Obligations. Borrower hereby ratifies, affirms, reaffirms, acknowledges,   confirms and agrees that the Note represents a valid and enforceable obligation of Borrower,   and Borrower further acknowledges that there are no existing claims, defenses, personal or   otherwise, or rights of setoff whatsoever with respect to the Note, and Borrower further   acknowledges and represents that no event has occurred and no condition exists which would   constitute a default under the Note, the Deed of Trust, or this Agreement, either with or without   notice or lapse of time, or both.      11. No Release of Liens. This Agreement in no way acts as a release or relinquishment   of the liens, security interests and rights (the “Liens”) created or evidenced by the Deed of Trust.   The Liens are hereby ratified and confirmed by Borrower in all respects and are hereby renewed   and extended to secure (i) the principal amount of the Note, (ii) all interest, charges and other   sums payable with respect thereto, and (iii) the performance of all other obligations under the   Deed of Trust.      12. Additional Modifications. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein   or inferred hereby or in any other instrument executed by Borrower or in any other action or   conduct undertaken by Borrower on or before the date hereof, the agreements, covenants and   provisions contained herein shall constitute the only evidence of Lender’s consent to modify the   terms and provisions of the Note, No express or implied consent to any further modifications   involving any of the matters set forth in this Agreement or otherwise, shall be inferred or implied   from Lender’s execution of this Agreement. Further, Lender’s execution of this Agreement shall   not constitute a waiver (either express or implied) of the requirement that any further   modifications of the Note shall require the express written approval of Lender, no such approval   (either express or implied) having been given as of the date hereof.      13. Miscellaneous.      (a) As modified hereby, the provisions of the Note and the Deed of Trust shall   continue in full force and effect, and the Borrower acknowledges and reaffirms its liability to   Lender thereunder.

(b) Borrower hereby agrees to pay all costs and expenses incurred by Lender in     

 





5      connection with the execution and administration of this Agreement and the modification of the   Note including, but not limited to, all appraisal costs, title insurance costs, legal fees incurred by   Lender and filing fees.      (c) Any default by Borrower in the performance of its obligations herein contained   shall constitute a default under the Note and the Deed of Trust and shall allow Lender to   exercise all of its remedies set forth in the Note and the Deed of Trust.      (d) Lender does not, by its execution of this Agreement, waive any rights it may   have against any person not a party thereto.      (e) Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees that the present unpaid principal   balance of the Note, and any future advances of principal drawn off of the Note by Borrower, if   any, together with accrued but unpaid interest thereon at the rate provided for in the Note, is   due and payable upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and that Lender is   under no obligation to refinance the Note or further modify the Maturity Date.      (f) In case any of the provisions of this Agreement shall for any reason be held to   be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect   any other provision hereof, and this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or   unenforceable provision had never been contained herein.      (g) This Agreement, the Deed of Trust and all other documents and instruments   executed in connection with the Note shall be governed and construed according to the laws of   the State of Texas and the applicable laws of the United States.

(k) All other terms, conditions and provisions of the Note and the Deed of Trust   shall remain in full force and effect as of the date thereof.      NOTICE TO OBLIGOR      THIS WRITTEN LOAN AGREEMENT REPRESENTS THE FINAL   AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND MAY NOT BE   CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS,   OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES.
