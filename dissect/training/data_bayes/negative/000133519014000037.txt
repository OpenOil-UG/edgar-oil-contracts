ARTICLE II -    The Loans and Letters of CreditSection 2.1.    Commitments to Lend; Notes.  Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each Lender agrees to make loans to Borrower (herein called such Lender’s “Loans”) upon Borrower’s request from time to time during the Commitment Period, provided that (a) subject to Sections 3.3, 3.4 and 3.6, Loans of the same Type shall be made by Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages and as part of the same Borrowing, and (b) after giving effect to such Loans, the Facility Usage does not exceed the Aggregate Commitment then in effect.  The aggregate amount of all Loans (other than Loans made pursuant to Section 2.11(b)) in any Borrowing must be greater than or equal to (a) in the case of Eurodollar Loans, $1,000,000 or any higher integral multiple of $500,000 or (b) in the case of Base Rate Loans, $500,000 or any higher integral multiple of $100,000 or must equal the remaining availability under the Aggregate Commitment.  Borrower may have no more than eight (8) Borrowings of Eurodollar Loans outstanding at any time.  Interest on each Loan shall accrue and be due and payable as provided herein.  Each Loan shall be due and payable as provided herein, and shall be due and payable in full on the Maturity Date.  Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Borrower may borrow, repay, and reborrow Loans hereunder.  The obligation of Borrower to repay to each Lender the aggregate amount of all Loans made by such Lender, together with interest accruing in connection therewith, may, at the option and upon the request of a Lender, be evidenced by a single promissory note (herein called such Lender’s “Note”) made by Borrower payable to such Lender or its registered assigns in the form of Exhibit A with appropriate insertions.  The amount of principal owing on any Lender’s Note at any given time shall be the aggregate amount of all Loans theretofore made by such Lender minus all payments of principal theretofore received by such Lender on such Note.Section 2.2.    Requests for New Loans.  Borrower must give to Administrative Agent written or electronic notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) of any requested Borrowing of new Loans to be advanced by Lenders.  Each such notice constitutes a “Borrowing Notice” hereunder and must:(a)    specify (i) the aggregate amount of any such Borrowing of new Base Rate Loans and the date on which such Base Rate Loans are to be advanced, or (ii) the aggregate amount of any such Borrowing of new Eurodollar Loans, the date on which such Eurodollar Loans are to be advanced (which date shall be the first day of the Interest Period that is to apply thereto), and the length of the applicable Interest Period; and(b)    be received by Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. on (i) the day on which any such Base Rate Loans are to be made, or (ii) the 3rd Business Day preceding the day on which any such Eurodollar Loans are to be made.Each such written request or confirmation must be made in the form and substance of the “Borrowing Notice” attached hereto as Exhibit B.  Each such telephonic request shall be deemed a representation and warranty by Borrower as to the matters that are required to be set out in such written confirmation.  Upon receipt of any such Borrowing Notice, Administrative Agent shall give each Lender prompt notice of the terms thereof.  If all conditions precedent to such new Loans have been met, each Lender will on the date requested promptly remit to Administrative Agent at Administrative Agent’s office in New York City the amount of such Lender’s new Loan in immediately available funds, and upon receipt of such funds, unless to its actual knowledge any conditions precedent to such Loans have been neither met nor waived as provided herein, Administrative Agent shall promptly make such Loans available to Borrower.  Unless Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Borrowing, Administrative Agent may in its discretion assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with this Section 2.2 and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to Borrower a corresponding amount.  In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and Borrower severally agree to pay to Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (ii) in the case of a payment to be made by Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans.  If Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to Borrower the amount of such interest paid by Borrower for such period.  If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in such Borrowing.  Section 2.3.    Continuations and Conversions of Existing Loans.  Borrower may make the following elections with respect to Loans already outstanding: to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Loans, to convert Eurodollar Loans to Base Rate Loans on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, and to continue Eurodollar Loans beyond the expiration of such Interest Period by designating a new Interest Period to take effect at the time of such expiration.  In making such elections, Borrower may combine existing Loans made pursuant to separate Borrowings into one new Borrowing or divide existing Loans made pursuant to one Borrowing into separate new Borrowings, provided that Borrower may have no more than eight (8) Borrowings of Eurodollar Loans outstanding at any time.  To make any such election, Borrower must give to Administrative Agent written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) of any such Conversion or Continuation of existing Loans, with a separate notice given for each new Borrowing.  Each such notice constitutes a “Continuation/Conversion Notice” hereunder and must:(a)    specify the existing Loans that are to be Continued or Converted;(b)    specify (i) the aggregate amount of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans into which such existing Loans are to be continued or converted and the date on which such Continuation or Conversion is to occur, or (ii) the aggregate amount of any Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans into which such existing Loans are to be continued or converted, the date on which such Continuation or Conversion is to occur (which date shall be the first day of the Interest Period that is to apply to such Eurodollar Loans), and the length of the applicable Interest Period; and(c)    be received by Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. on (i) the day on which any such Continuation or Conversion to Base Rate Loans is to occur, or (ii) the 3rd Business Day preceding the day on which any such Continuation or Conversion to Eurodollar Loans is to occur.Each such written request or confirmation must be made in the form and substance of the “Continuation/Conversion Notice” attached hereto as Exhibit C.  Each such telephonic request shall be deemed a representation and warranty by Borrower as to the matters that are required to be set out in such written confirmation.  Upon receipt of any such Continuation/Conversion Notice, Administrative Agent shall give each Lender prompt notice of the terms thereof.  Each Continuation/Conversion Notice shall be irrevocable and binding on Borrower.  During the continuance of any Default, Borrower may not make any election to convert existing Loans into Eurodollar Loans or continue existing Loans as Eurodollar Loans unless Administrative Agent and Lenders shall have otherwise consented in writing.  If (due to the existence of a Default or for any other reason) Borrower fails to give any Continuation/Conversion Notice with respect to a Borrowing of existing Eurodollar Loans by the time specified in clause (c) above, such Eurodollar Loans shall automatically be converted into Base Rate Loans at the end of such Interest Period.  No new funds shall be repaid by Borrower or advanced by any Lender in connection with any Continuation or Conversion of existing Loans pursuant to this section, and no such Continuation or Conversion shall be deemed to be a new advance of funds for any purpose; such Continuations and Conversions merely constitute a change in the interest rate applicable to already outstanding Loans.Section 2.4.    Use of Proceeds.  Borrower shall use all Loans (a) to refinance existing indebtedness outstanding on the Closing Date, including the term loans, prepayment premiums and other obligation owed under the Existing Loan Agreement, (b) to pay fees and expenses payable in connection with the closing of this Agreement and the funding of the initial Loans hereunder, (c) to finance maintenance and expansion capital expenditures related to their Systems, (d) to finance acquisitions permitted under the terms of this Agreement, (e) to refinance from time to time Matured LC Obligations, (f) provide working capital for its operations and (g) for other general business purposes.  Borrower shall use all Letters of Credit for its general corporate purposes.  In no event shall the funds from any Loan or any Letter of Credit be used directly or indirectly by any Person for personal, family, household or agricultural purposes or for the purpose, whether immediate, incidental or ultimate, of purchasing, acquiring or carrying any “margin stock” (as such term is defined in Regulation U promulgated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) or to extend credit to others directly or indirectly for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any such margin stock.  No part of the proceeds of any Loan, directly or indirectly, will be used for the purpose of financing the activities of any Person currently subject to any U.S. sanctions administered by OFAC.Section 2.5.    Interest Rates and Fees; Payment Dates; Retroactive Adjustments of Applicable Interest Rates.(a)    Interest Rates.  Subject to subsection (b) below, (i) each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on each day outstanding at the Adjusted Base Rate in effect on such day, and (ii) each Eurodollar Loan shall bear interest on each day during the related Interest Period at the related Adjusted Eurodollar Rate in effect on such day.  Subject to subsection (b) below, all other Obligations that are not paid when due shall bear interest on each day outstanding at Adjusted Base Rate in effect on such day.(b)    Default Rate.  If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing under Section 8.1(i)(i), (i)(ii), or (i)(iii), all outstanding Obligations shall bear interest at the applicable Default Rate.  In addition, if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing (other than under Section 8.1(i)(i), (i)(ii), or (i)(iii)), Required Lenders (or Administrative Agent at the direction of Required Lenders) may, by notice to Borrower, elect to have the outstanding Obligations bear interest at the applicable Default Rate, whereupon such Obligations shall bear interest at the applicable Default Rate until the earlier of (i) the first date thereafter upon which there shall be no Event of Default continuing and (ii) the date upon which Required Lenders shall have rescinded such notice.    (c)    Commitment Fees.  In consideration of each Lender’s commitment to make Loans, Borrower will pay to Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a commitment fee determined on a daily basis by applying the Commitment Fee Rate to such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of the Unused Availability determined at the end of each day during the Commitment Period.  This commitment fee shall be due and payable in arrears on the last day of each Fiscal Quarter and at the end of the Commitment Period.  (d)    Administrative Agent’s Fees.  In addition to all other amounts due to Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents, Borrower will pay fees to Administrative Agent as described in the Fee Letter.(e)    Payment Dates.  On each Interest Payment Date relating to Base Rate Loans, Borrower shall pay to Lenders all unpaid interest that has accrued on the Base Rate Loans to but not including such Interest Payment Date.  On each Interest Payment Date relating to a Eurodollar Loan, Borrower shall pay to Lenders all unpaid interest that has accrued on such Eurodollar Loan to but not including such Interest Payment Date. (f)    Retroactive Adjustments of Applicable Interest Rates.  If, as a result of any restatement of or other adjustment to the financial statements of Borrower or for any other reason, Borrower or Required Lenders determine that (i) the Consolidated Leverage Ratio as calculated by Borrower as of any applicable date was inaccurate and (ii) a proper calculation of the Consolidated Leverage Ratio would have resulted in higher pricing for such period, Borrower shall immediately and retroactively be obligated to pay to Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Lenders, promptly on demand by Administrative Agent (or, after the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code, automatically and without further action by Administrative Agent, any Lender or LC Issuer), an amount equal to the excess of the amount of interest and fees that should have been paid for such period over the amount of interest and fees actually paid for such period.  This paragraph shall not limit the rights of Administrative Agent, any Lender or LC Issuer, as the case may be, under this Section 2.5 or Section 2.11(a) or under Article VIII.  Borrower’s obligations under this paragraph shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and the repayment of all other Obligations hereunder.  Section 2.6.    Optional Prepayments.  Borrower may, from time to time and without premium or penalty prepay the Loans, in whole or in part, upon prior written notice to Administrative Agent, provided that (i) such notice must be received by Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (A) on the day on which any Base Rate Loan is to be prepaid and (B) on the 3rd Business Day preceding the day on which any Eurodollar Loan is to be prepaid, (ii) the aggregate amounts of all partial prepayments of principal on the Loans equals $1,000,000 or any higher integral multiple of $100,000 and (iii) if Borrower prepays any Eurodollar Loan on any day other than the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, it shall pay to Lenders any amounts due under Section 3.4.  Each prepayment of principal under this section shall be accompanied by all interest then accrued and unpaid on the principal so prepaid.  Any principal or interest prepaid pursuant to this section shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, all payments otherwise required to be paid under the Loan Documents at the time of such prepayment.Section 2.7.    Mandatory Prepayments.  (a)    If at any time the Facility Usage exceeds the Aggregate Commitment (whether due to a reduction in the Aggregate Commitment in accordance with this Agreement, or otherwise), Borrower shall immediately upon demand prepay the principal of the Loans (and after all Loans are repaid in full, Cash Collateralize the LC Obligations in accordance with Section 2.16) in an amount at least equal to such excess.(b)    If any Restricted Person Disposes of any property (other than any Disposition of any property permitted by clauses (a) through (j) of Section 7.5) that results in the realization by such Person of Net Cash Proceeds, Borrower shall prepay an aggregate principal amount of Loans equal to such Net Cash Proceeds immediately upon receipt thereof by such Person; provided, however, that, with respect to any Net Cash Proceeds realized under a Disposition described in this Section 2.7(b), at the election of Borrower (as notified by Borrower to Administrative Agent on or prior to the date of such Disposition), and so long as no Default shall have occurred and be continuing, such Restricted Person may reinvest all or any portion of such Net Cash Proceeds in the purchase of capital assets so long as within 180 days after the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds a definitive agreement shall have been entered into in respect of such purchase and within 270 days after the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds such purchase shall have been consummated (as certified by Borrower in writing to Administrative Agent) and pending such consummation such Net Cash Proceeds remain on deposit in an account subject to Administrative Agent’s control; and provided further, however, that any Net Cash Proceeds not so reinvested shall be immediately applied to the prepayment of the Loans as set forth in this Section 2.7(b).Section 2.8.    Commitment Reductions.  Borrower may, upon notice to Administrative Agent, terminate the Aggregate Commitment, or from time to time permanently reduce the Aggregate Commitment; provided that (i) any such notice shall be received by Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. three (3) Business Days prior to the date of termination or reduction, (ii) any such partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount of $5,000,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, (iii) Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Aggregate Commitment if, after giving effect thereto and to any concurrent prepayments hereunder, the Facility Usage would exceed the Aggregate Commitment, and (iv) if, after giving effect to any reduction of the Aggregate Commitment, the LC Sublimit exceeds the amount of the Aggregate Commitment, each such sublimit shall be automatically reduced by the amount of such excess.  Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Lenders of any such notice of termination or reduction of the Aggregate Commitment.  Any reduction of the Aggregate Commitment shall be applied to the Commitment of each Lender according to its Applicable Percentage.  All fees accrued until the effective date of any termination of the Aggregate Commitments shall be paid on the effective date of such termination.Section 2.9.    Letters of Credit.  Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Borrower may at any time during the Commitment Period request LC Issuer to issue, increase the amount of or otherwise amend or extend, one or more Letters of Credit, provided that:(a)    after taking such Letter of Credit into account, the Facility Usage does not exceed the Aggregate Commitment at such time; (b)    after taking such Letter of Credit into account, the aggregate amount of LC Obligations at such time does not exceed the LC Sublimit; (c)    the expiration date of such Letter of Credit (as extended, if applicable) is prior to the earliest to occur of (i) 12 months after the issuance thereof (subject to Section 2.10(b)), and (ii) the Letter of Credit Termination Date;(d)    such Letter of Credit is to be used for general business purposes of a Restricted Person that is a U.S. Person or is to be denominated in a currency other than Dollars; (e)    the issuance of such Letter of Credit would not violate one or more policies of the LC Issuer applicable to letters of credit generally;  (f)    such Letter of Credit does not contain any provisions for automatic reinstatement of the stated amount after any drawing thereunder;  (g)    no order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the LC Issuer from issuing such Letter of Credit, and no Law applicable to the LC Issuer or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the LC Issuer shall prohibit, or request that the LC Issuer refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon the LC Issuer with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which the LC Issuer is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or shall impose upon the LC Issuer any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the Closing Date and which the LC Issuer in good faith deems material to it;(h)    the form and terms of such Letter of Credit are acceptable to LC Issuer in its discretion; and(i)    all other conditions in this Agreement to the issuance of such Letter of Credit have been satisfied.LC Issuer will honor any such request if the foregoing conditions (a) through (i) (the “LC Conditions”) have been met as of the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, LC Issuer shall not at any time be obligated to issue, amend, renew or extend any Letter of Credit if any Lender is at that time a Defaulting Lender, unless LC Issuer has entered into arrangements, including the delivery of Cash Collateral, satisfactory to LC Issuer (in its discretion) with Borrower or such Lender to eliminate LC Issuer’s actual or potential Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to Section 2.17(a)(iv)) with respect to the Defaulting Lender arising from either the Letter of Credit then proposed to be issued or that Letter of Credit and all other LC Obligations as to which LC Issuer has actual or potential Fronting Exposure, as it may elect in its discretion.Borrower may also at any time during the Commitment Period request that LC Issuer extend the expiration date of an existing Letter of Credit or modify an existing Letter of Credit (other than an increase or extension) and LC Issuer will honor such request if the LC Conditions set forth in subsection (c) of this Section 2.9 are met; provided that in the case of any such modification (other than an increase or extension), LC Issuer shall have approved such modification.LC Issuer shall have at all times the benefits and immunities (a) provided to Administrative Agent in Article IX with respect to any acts taken or omissions suffered by LC Issuer in connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by it and documents pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term “Administrative Agent” as used in Article IX included LC Issuer with respect to such acts or omissions, and (b) as additionally provided herein with respect to LC Issuer.Section 2.10.    Requesting Letters of Credit.  (a)    Borrower must make written application for any Letter of Credit or amendment or extension of any Letter of Credit at least three (3) Business Days (or such shorter period as LC Issuer may in its discretion from time to time agree) before the date on which Borrower desires for LC Issuer to issue such Letter of Credit.  By making any such written application, unless otherwise expressly stated therein, Borrower shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that the LC Conditions described in Section 2.9 will be met as of the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit.  Each such written application for a Letter of Credit must be made in writing in the form customarily used by LC Issuer, the terms and provisions of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference (or in such other form as may mutually be agreed upon by LC Issuer and Borrower).  (b)    If Borrower so requests in any applicable LC Application, LC Issuer may, in its discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic extension provisions (each, an “Auto-Extension Letter of Credit”); provided that any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit must permit LC Issuer to prevent any such extension at least once in each 12 month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the “Non-Extension Notice Date”) in each such 12 month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued.  Unless otherwise directed by LC Issuer, Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to LC Issuer for any such extension.  Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) LC Issuer to permit the extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the Letter of Credit Termination Date; provided, however, that LC Issuer shall not permit any such extension if (i) LC Issuer has determined that it would not be permitted, or would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its revised form (as extended) under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of Section 2.9 or otherwise), or (ii) it has received notice (which notice may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is 5 Business Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date (1) from Administrative Agent that Required Lenders have elected not to permit such extension or (2) from Administrative Agent, any Lender or Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 4.2 is not then satisfied, and in each such case directing LC Issuer not to permit such extension.(c)    Upon satisfaction of the LC Conditions for a Letter of Credit (or if LC Issuer otherwise desires to issue such Letter of Credit earlier), LC Issuer will issue such Letter of Credit at LC Issuer’s office in New York City.  If any provisions of any LC Application conflict with any provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall govern and control.  Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of noncompliance with Borrower’s instructions or other irregularity, Borrower will immediately notify LC Issuer.Section 2.11.    Reimbursement and Participations.(a)    Reimbursement by Borrower.  Each Matured LC Obligation shall constitute a loan by LC Issuer to Borrower.  Borrower promises to pay to LC Issuer, or to LC Issuer’s order, on demand, the full amount of each Matured LC Obligation, together with interest thereon (i) at the rate applicable to Base Rate Loans to and including the first Business Day after such demand is made by LC Issuer and (ii) to the extent imposed pursuant to Section 2.5(a) of this Agreement, at the Default Rate applicable to Base Rate Loans on each day thereafter.  The obligation of Borrower to reimburse LC Issuer for each Matured LC Obligation shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (including any LC Application) under all circumstances, including the following: (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto; (ii) the existence of any claim, counterclaim, set-off, defense or other right that Borrower may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), LC Issuer or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction; (iii) any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit; (iv) any payment by LC Issuer under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; (v) compliance with any laws, customs and regulations which may be effective in countries of issuance, presentation under, negotiation and/or payment of any Letter of Credit or any ruling of any court or governmental authority or agency, or any control or restriction rightfully or wrongfully exercised by any government or group asserting or exercising governmental or paramount powers; (vi) the acceptance by LC Issuer as complying with the applicable Letter of Credit of any draft or document drawn, issued or presented under such Letter of Credit which is issued or purportedly issued by an agent, executor, trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative or successor of the party identified in such Letter of Credit as the party permitted to draw, issue or present such draft or document (or any transferee thereof); (vii) any error, neglect, insolvency, failure of business or default of any of LC Issuer’s Nominated Persons; (viii) any delay, omission, interruption, loss in transit, or mutilation or other errors arising in (A) transmission, dispatch or delivery of any document or draft or proceeds thereof or (B) transmission, dispatch or delivery of any messages by mail, cable, telegraph, wireless or otherwise, whether or not they be in code; (ix) the description, weight, existence, character, quality, quantity, condition, packing, value or delivery of the property, services or performance purporting to be represented by documents, or errors in translation or errors in interpretation of technical terms; (x) any difference in character, quality, quantity, condition or value of the property from that expressed in documents; (xi) the time, place, manner or order in which shipment is made; (xii) any partial or incomplete shipment or failure or omission to ship any or all of the property referred to in any Letter of Credit; (xiii) the character, adequacy, validity or genuineness of any insurance; (xiv) the solvency or responsibility of any insurer, or the acts or omissions, performance or standing of any insurer, or any other risk connected with insurance; (xv) any deviation from instructions, delay, default or fraud by the shipper or anyone else in connection with the property or the shipping thereof; (xvi) the solvency, responsibility, performance or standing of, or the acts or omissions of, any consignor, carrier, forwarder or consignee of any goods or any other Person; (xvii) any delay in arrival or failure to arrive of either the property or any of the documents relating thereto; (xviii) any delay in giving or failure to give notice of arrival or any other notice; (xix) any claim, breach of contract or dispute between the beneficiary, shippers or vendors and Borrower; (xx) any waiver of any requirement in a Letter of Credit that exists for LC Issuer’s protection and not the protection of Borrower or any waiver which does not in fact materially prejudice Borrower; (xxi) any payment made in respect of a draft or document presented after the date specified as the expiration date of, or the date by which documents must be received under, such Letter of Credit if payment after such date is authorized by the UCC, the UCP or the ISP, as applicable; (xxii) without limiting the foregoing, any consequences arising (A) from the interruption of LC Issuer’s business, acts of God, riots, civil commotions, insurrections, war, acts of terrorism, strikes, lockouts, or other causes beyond LC Issuer’s control, (B) from any act or omission by LC Issuer or any of its Nominated Persons, Affiliates or agents or any bank whose services are utilized for the purpose of giving effect to Borrower’s instructions, in each case if not done or omitted with LC Issuer’s gross negligence or willful misconduct, or (C) from the failure of another bank to carry out instructions transmitted by LC Issuer, whether such other bank was selected by Borrower, LC Issuer or any other Person; or (xxiii) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; and none of the above shall affect, impair or prevent the vesting of any of LC Issuer’s rights or powers hereunder.  If any Letter of Credit provides that payments are to be made by the applicable LC Issuer’s Nominated Person, neither LC Issuer nor such Nominated Person shall be responsible for the failure of any of the documents specified in such Letter of Credit to come into LC Issuer’s possession or for any delay in connection therewith, and Borrower’s obligations under this Agreement shall not be affected by such failure or delay in the receipt by LC Issuer of any such documents.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is expressly agreed that the absolute and unconditional nature of Borrower’s obligations under this section to reimburse LC Issuer for each drawing under a Letter of Credit will not be excused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of LC Issuer.  However, the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse LC Issuer from liability to Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable Law) suffered by Borrower that are caused by LC Issuer’s gross negligence or willful misconduct in determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof.In addition to the exculpatory provisions contained in the UCP, the ISP and/or the UCC, as applicable, the LC Issuer and LC Issuer’s Nominated Persons shall not be responsible for, and Borrower’s obligation to reimburse LC Issuer for each Matured LC Obligation shall not be affected or reduced by, any action or inaction required or permitted under the UCC, the UCP or the ISP, in each case as applicable.(b)    Letter of Credit Advances.  If the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit makes a draft or other demand for payment thereunder then, unless Borrower shall have notified LC Issuer and Administrative Agent prior to 11:00 a.m., on the Business Day on which such drawing is honored that Borrower intends to reimburse the LC Issuer for the amount of such drawing in funds other than from the proceeds of a Loan, Borrower shall be deemed to have timely given a Notice of Borrowing to Administrative Agent requesting Lenders to make a Base Rate Loan on the date on which such drawing is honored in an exact amount due to LC Issuer; provided that for purposes solely of such Loan, the minimum amounts for Loan set forth in Section 2.1 and the conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.2 hereof shall not be applicable and for the purposes of the first sentence of Section 2.1, the amount of such Loans shall be considered, but the amount of the Matured LC Obligation to be concurrently paid by such Loans shall not be considered. (c)    Participation by Lenders.  LC Issuer irrevocably agrees to grant and hereby grants to each Lender, and, to induce LC Issuer to issue Letters of Credit hereunder, each Lender irrevocably agrees to accept and purchase and hereby accepts and purchases from LC Issuer, on the terms and conditions hereinafter stated and for such Lender’s own account and risk, an undivided interest equal to such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of LC Issuer’s obligations and rights under each Letter of Credit issued hereunder and the amount of each Matured LC Obligation paid by LC Issuer thereunder.  Each Lender unconditionally and irrevocably agrees with LC Issuer that, if a Matured LC Obligation is paid under any Letter of Credit for which LC Issuer is not reimbursed in full by Borrower in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the related LC Application (including any reimbursement by means of concurrent Loans or by the application of Cash Collateral), such Lender shall (in all circumstances and without set-off or counterclaim) pay to LC Issuer on demand (and Administrative Agent may apply Cash Collateral provided for this purpose), in immediately available funds at LC Issuer’s address for notices hereunder, such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of such Matured LC Obligation (or any portion thereof that has not been reimbursed by Borrower).  Each Lender’s obligation to pay LC Issuer pursuant to the terms of this subsection is irrevocable and unconditional.  If any amount required to be paid by any Lender to LC Issuer pursuant to this subsection is paid by such Lender to LC Issuer within 3 Business Days after the date such payment is due, LC Issuer shall in addition to such amount be entitled to recover from such Lender, on demand, interest thereon calculated from such due date at the Federal Funds Rate.  If any amount required to be paid by any Lender to LC Issuer pursuant to this subsection is not paid by such Lender to LC Issuer within 3 Business Days after the date such payment is due, LC Issuer shall in addition to such amount be entitled to recover from such Lender, on demand, interest thereon calculated from such due date at the Default Rate applicable to Base Rate Loans.(d)    Distributions to Participants.  Whenever LC Issuer has in accordance with this section received from any Lender payment of such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of any Matured LC Obligation, if LC Issuer thereafter receives any payment of such Matured LC Obligation or any payment of interest thereon (whether directly from Borrower or by application of Cash Collateral or otherwise, and excluding only interest for any period prior to LC Issuer’s demand that such Lender make such payment of its Applicable Percentage), LC Issuer will distribute to such Lender its Applicable Percentage of the amounts so received by LC Issuer; provided, however, that if any such payment received by LC Issuer must thereafter be returned by LC Issuer, such Lender shall return to LC Issuer the portion thereof that LC Issuer has previously distributed to it.(e)    Calculations.  A written advice setting forth in reasonable detail the amounts owing under this section, submitted by LC Issuer to Borrower or any Lender from time to time, shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, as to the amounts thereof.Section 2.12.    Letter of Credit Fees.  In consideration of LC Issuer’s issuance of any Letter of Credit, Borrower agrees to pay (a) to Administrative Agent, for the account of all Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages, a letter of credit issuance fee at a rate equal to the Letter of Credit Fee Rate then in effect (which fee shall be increased by 2.0% per annum during any period in which interest on the Loans accrues at the Default Rate), and (b) to such LC Issuer for its own account, a letter of credit fronting fee at a rate equal to 0.20% per annum times the face amount of such Letter of Credit; provided, however, any Letter of Credit Fees otherwise payable for the account of a Defaulting Lender with respect to any Letter of Credit as to which such Defaulting Lender has not provided Cash Collateral satisfactory to LC Issuer pursuant to Section 2.9 shall be payable, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, to the other Lenders in accordance with the upward adjustments in their respective Applicable Percentages allocable to such Letter of Credit pursuant to Section 2.17(a)(iv), with the balance of such fee, if any, payable to LC Issuer for its own account.  In addition, Borrower will pay to LC Issuer LC Issuer’s customary fees for issuance, amendment and drawing of each Letter of Credit.  The letter of credit fee and the letter of credit fronting fee will be calculated on the undrawn face amount of each Letter of Credit outstanding on each day at the above-applicable rates and will be due and payable in arrears on the last Business Day of each Fiscal Quarter and at the end of the Commitment Period.  Section 2.13.    No Duty to Inquire.(a)    Drafts and Demands.  LC Issuer is authorized and instructed to accept and pay drafts and demands for payment under any Letter of Credit without requiring, and without responsibility for, any determination as to the existence of any event giving rise to said draft, either at the time of acceptance or payment or thereafter.  LC Issuer is under no duty to determine the proper identity of anyone presenting such a draft or making such a demand (whether by tested telex or otherwise) as the officer, representative or agent of any beneficiary under any Letter of Credit, and payment by LC Issuer to any such beneficiary when requested by any such purported officer, representative or agent is hereby authorized and approved.  LC Issuer shall have the right, in its discretion, to decline to accept documents and to make such payment if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.  Borrower releases LC Issuer from, and agrees to hold LC Issuer harmless and indemnified against, any liability or claim in connection with or arising out of the subject matter of this section, which indemnity shall apply whether or not any such liability or claim is in any way or to any extent caused, in whole or in part, by any negligent act or omission of any kind by LC Issuer, provided only that LC Issuer shall not be released from or entitled to indemnification for that portion, if any, of any liability or claim that is proximately caused by or results from its own individual gross negligence or willful misconduct or breach in bad faith of its obligations under any Loan Document, as determined in a final judgment.  (b)    Extension of Maturity.  If the maturity of any Letter of Credit is extended by its terms or by Law or governmental action, if any extension of the maturity or time for presentation of drafts or any other modification of the terms of any Letter of Credit is made at the request of any Restricted Person, or if the amount of any Letter of Credit is increased at the request of any Restricted Person, this Agreement shall be binding upon all Restricted Persons with respect to such Letter of Credit as so extended, increased or otherwise modified, with respect to drafts and property covered thereby, and with respect to any action taken by LC Issuer, LC Issuer’s correspondents, or any Lender Party in accordance with such extension, increase or other modification.(c)    Transferees of Letters of Credit.  If any Letter of Credit provides that it is transferable, LC Issuer shall have no duty to determine the proper identity of anyone appearing as transferee of such Letter of Credit, nor shall LC Issuer be charged with responsibility of any nature or character for the validity or correctness of any transfer or successive transfers, and payment by LC Issuer to any purported transferee or transferees as determined by LC Issuer is hereby authorized and approved, and Borrower releases LC Issuer from, and agrees to hold LC Issuer harmless and indemnified against, any liability or claim in connection with or arising out of the foregoing, which indemnity shall apply whether or not any such liability or claim is in any way or to any extent caused, in whole or in part, by any negligent act or omission of any kind by LC Issuer, provided only that LC Issuer shall not be released from or entitled to indemnification for that portion, if any, of any liability or claim that is proximately caused by or results from its own individual gross negligence or willful misconduct or breach in bad faith of its obligations under any Loan Document, as determined in a final judgment.  Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit; provided, however, that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude Borrower from pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against such beneficiary or transferee.(d)    Role of the LC Issuer.  (i)    The responsibility of LC Issuer to Borrower in connection with any draft presented for payment under any Letter of Credit issued on behalf of Borrower shall, in addition to any payment obligation expressly provided for in such Letter of Credit, be limited to determining that the documents (including each draft) delivered by or on behalf of the beneficiary under such Letter of Credit in connection with such presentment appear on their face to be in conformity with such Letter of Credit.  In addition, the Lenders and Borrower agree that, in paying any drawing or demand for payment under any Letter of Credit, LC Issuer shall not have any responsibility to inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any document presented in connection with such drawing or demand for payment or the authority of the Person executing or delivering the same.(ii)    Neither LC Issuer nor any of the respective correspondents, participants or assignees of LC Issuer shall be liable to any Lender for: (A) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith in respect of any Letter of Credit at the request or with the approval or deemed approval of the Required Lenders; (B) any action taken or omitted in respect of any Letter of Credit in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct;  or (C) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or any document delivered in connection with the issuance or payment of such Letter of Credit. Section 2.14.    Sharing of Payments by Lenders.  If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Loans made by it, or the participations in LC Obligations resulting in such Lender’s receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such Loans or participations and accrued interest thereon greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and subparticipations in LC Obligations of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and other amounts owing them (except that with respect to any other Lender that is a Defaulting Lender by virtue of such Lender failing to fund its required share (if any) of any Loan or LC Obligation, such Defaulting Lender’s pro rata share of the excess payment shall be allocated to the Lender (or the Lenders, pro rata) that funded such Defaulting Lender’s required share (if any)), provided that:(i)    if any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and(ii)    the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by or on behalf of Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender), (y) the application of Cash Collateral provided for in Section 2.16, or (z) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or subparticipations in LC Obligations to any assignee or participant, other than an assignment to Borrower or any Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply).Each Restricted Person consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Restricted Person rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Restricted Person in the amount of such participation.Section 2.15.    Obligations of Lenders Several.  The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and to make payments pursuant to Section 2.2 are several and not joint.  The failure of any Lender to make any Loan; to fund any such participation or to make any payment under Section 10.4(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section 10.4(c). Section 2.16.    Cash Collateral.  (a)    Certain Credit Support Events.  Upon the request of Administrative Agent or LC Issuer (i) if LC Issuer has honored any full or partial drawing request under any Letter of Credit and such drawing has resulted in a Matured LC Obligation, or (ii) if, as of the Letter of Credit Termination Date, any LC Obligation for any reason remains outstanding, Borrower shall, in each case, immediately Cash Collateralize the then Outstanding Amount of all LC Obligations.  If, after the making of all mandatory prepayments required under Section 2.7, the outstanding LC Obligations will exceed the Aggregate Commitments, then in addition to prepayment of the entire principal balance of the Loans required under Section 2.7, Borrower shall immediately Cash Collateralize the then outstanding LC Obligations in an amount equal to such excess.  At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, immediately upon the request of Administrative Agent or LC Issuer, Borrower shall deliver Cash Collateral to Administrative Agent in an amount sufficient to cover all Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to Section 2.17(a)(iv) and any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender).  (b)    Grant of Security Interest.  All Cash Collateral (other than credit support not constituting funds subject to deposit) shall be maintained in blocked deposit accounts at Administrative Agent.  Borrower, and to the extent provided by any Lender, such Lender, hereby grants to (and subjects to the control of) Administrative Agent, for the benefit of Administrative Agent, LC Issuer and the Lenders, and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein, and all other property so provided as collateral pursuant hereto, and in all proceeds of the foregoing, all as security for the obligations to which such Cash Collateral may be applied pursuant to Section 2.16(c).  If at any time Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than Administrative Agent as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the applicable Fronting Exposure and other obligations secured thereby, Borrower or the relevant Defaulting Lender will, promptly upon demand by Administrative Agent, pay or provide to Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency.(c)    Application.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under any of this Section 2.16 or Section 2.7, 2.9, 2.17, or 8.3 in respect of Letters of Credit shall be held and applied to the satisfaction of the specific LC Obligations, obligations to fund participations therein (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) and other obligations for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may be provided for herein.  (d)    Release.  Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce Fronting Exposure or other obligations shall be released promptly following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure or other obligations giving rise thereto (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender (or, as appropriate, its assignee following compliance with Section 10.5(h))) or (ii) Administrative Agent’s good faith determination that there exists excess Cash Collateral; provided, however, (x) that Cash Collateral furnished by or on behalf of a Restricted Person shall not be released during the continuance of an Event of Default (and following application as provided in this Section 2.16 may be otherwise applied in accordance with Section 8.3), and (y) the Person providing Cash Collateral and LC Issuer may agree that Cash Collateral shall not be released but instead held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other obligations.  Section 2.17.    Defaulting Lenders.  (a)    Adjustments.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable Law:(i)    Waivers and Amendments.  That Defaulting Lender’s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in Section 10.1.(ii)    Reallocation of Payments.  Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by Administrative Agent for the account of that Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article III or VIII or otherwise, and including any amounts made available to Administrative Agent by that Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 10.14), shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by that Defaulting Lender to Administrative Agent hereunder; second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by that Defaulting Lender to LC Issuer hereunder; third, if so determined by Administrative Agent or requested by LC Issuer, to be held as Cash Collateral for future funding obligations of that Defaulting Lender of any participation in any Letter of Credit; fourth, as Borrower may request (so long as no Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by Administrative Agent; fifth, if so determined by Administrative Agent and Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and released in order to satisfy obligations of that Defaulting Lender to fund Loans under this Agreement; sixth, to the payment of any amounts owing to Lenders or LC Issuer as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender or LC Issuer against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; seventh, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by Borrower against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and eighth, to that Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or Matured LC Obligations in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share and (y) such Loans or Matured LC Obligations were made at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.2 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and Matured LC Obligations owed to, all non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or Matured LC Obligations owed to, that Defaulting Lender.  Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.17(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by that Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.  (iii)    Certain Fees.  That Defaulting Lender (x) shall not be entitled to receive any commitment fee pursuant to Section 2.5(c) for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender) and (y) shall be limited in its right to receive Letter of Credit Fees as provided in Section 2.12. (iv)    Reallocation of Applicable Percentages to Reduce Fronting Exposure.  All or any part of that Defaulting Lender’s participation in LC Obligations shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages (calculated without regard to that Defaulting Lender’s Commitment) but only to the extent that (x) the conditions set forth in Section 4.2 are satisfied at the time of such reallocation, and (y) such reallocation does not cause the aggregate amount of the Loans and participations in LC Obligations of any non-Defaulting Lender to exceed the lesser of (1) such non-Defaulting Lender’s Commitment and (2) such non-Defaulting Lender’s Applicable Percentage of the Aggregate Commitment (calculated without giving effect to any reallocations pursuant to this clause (iv)).  No reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such non-Defaulting Lender’s increased exposure following such reallocation. (b)    Defaulting Lender Cure.  If Borrower, Administrative Agent and LC Issuer agree in writing in their discretion that a Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which conditions may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders in accordance with their Applicable Percentages (without giving effect to Section 2.17(a)(iv)), whereupon that Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.Section 2.18.    Increase of Aggregate Commitments.(a)    If no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Borrower may at any time during the Availability Period request one or more increases of the Aggregate Commitments by notice to Administrative Agent in writing of the amount of such proposed increase (an “Increase Notice”); provided, however, that (i) the Commitment of any Lender may not be increased without such Lender’s consent, (ii) the minimum amount of any such increase shall be $5,000,000 and (iii) the amount of the Aggregate Commitments, after giving effect to any such increase, shall not exceed $150,000,000.(b)    Following any Increase Notice, Borrower may, in its discretion, but with the consent of Administrative Agent and LC Issuer as to any Person that is not at such time a Lender (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), offer to any existing Lender or to one or more additional banks or financial institutions the opportunity to participate in all or a portion of the increased Aggregate Commitments pursuant to Section 2.18(c) below, by notifying Administrative Agent.  Administrative Agent shall promptly deliver such notice on behalf of Borrower to the one or more Lenders and, to the extent so consented to by Administrative Agent and LC Issuer, additional banks or financial institutions selected by Borrower.(c)    Any existing Lender that Borrower selects to offer such a participation in the increased Aggregate Commitments and any additional bank or financial institution that Borrower selects to offer a participation in the increased Aggregate Commitments and so consented to by Administrative Agent and LC Issuer, in each case that agrees to participate in the increased Aggregate Commitments shall notify Administrative Agent of its agreement to participate in the increased Aggregate Commitments within such time as Borrower and Administrative Agent shall have specified in the notice of such offer.  (d)    Any such additional bank or financial institution agreeing to participate in such increased Aggregate Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.18 shall execute and deliver to Administrative Agent a joinder agreement in form and substance satisfactory to Administrative Agent and its counsel setting forth the Commitment of such bank or financial institution and, upon the effectiveness of such joinder agreement, such bank or financial institution (a “New Lender”) shall become a Lender for all purposes and to the same extent as if originally a party hereto and shall be bound by and entitled to the benefits of this Agreement and the signature pages hereof shall be deemed to be amended to add the name of such New Lender and Annex 1 and the definition of Aggregate Commitments in Section 1.1 shall be deemed amended to increase the Aggregate Commitments by the Commitment of such New Lender; provided that the Commitment of any New Lender shall be in an amount not less than $5,000,000.(e)    Any existing Lender that accepts an offer to it by Borrower to increase its Commitment pursuant to this Section 2.18 shall execute and deliver to Administrative Agent a commitment increase agreement in form and substance satisfactory to Administrative Agent and its counsel, whereupon such Lender shall be bound by and entitled to the benefits of this Agreement with respect to the full amount of its Commitment as so increased, and Annex 1 and the definition of Aggregate Commitments in Section 1.1 shall be deemed to reflect such increase.(f)    The effectiveness of any such joinder agreement of a New Lender or any such commitment increase agreement of an existing Lender shall be contingent upon receipt by Administrative Agent of such corporate resolutions of Borrower authorizing such increase, and such other documents and opinions reasonably requested by Administrative Agent, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent.   (g)    If any bank or financial institution becomes a New Lender pursuant to paragraph (d) above or any Lender’s Commitment is increased pursuant to paragraph (e) above, Loans made on or after the effectiveness thereof (the “Re-Allocation Date”) shall be made pro rata based on the Lenders’ Commitments in effect on and after such Re-Allocation Date. (h)    If on any Re-Allocation Date there is an unpaid principal amount of Loans, Borrower and Lenders authorize Administrative Agent and Borrower to make non-ratable borrowings and prepayments of the Loans, and if any such prepayment requires the payment of Eurodollar Rate Loans other than on the last day of the applicable Interest Period, Borrower shall pay any required amounts pursuant to Section 3.4, in order to keep the outstanding Loans ratable with any revised Applicable Percentages arising from any nonratable increase in the Commitments and from the Commitments of a New Lender.ARTICLE III -    Payments to LendersSection 3.1.    General Procedures.  Borrower will make each payment that it owes under the Loan Documents to Administrative Agent for the account of the Lender Party to whom such payment is owed, in lawful money of the United States of America, without set-off, deduction or counterclaim, and in immediately available funds.  Each such payment must be received by Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 (noon) on the date such payment becomes due and payable.  Any payment received by Administrative Agent after such time will be deemed to have been made on the next following Business Day.  Should any such payment become due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity of such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of a payment of principal or past due interest, interest shall accrue and be payable thereon for the period of such extension as provided in the Loan Document under which such payment is due.  Each payment under a Loan Document shall be due and payable at the place set forth for Administrative Agent on the Lenders Schedule. When Administrative Agent collects or receives money on account of the Obligations, Administrative Agent shall distribute all money so collected or received, and each Lender Party shall apply all such money so distributed (except as otherwise provided in Section 8.3) for the payment of all Obligations that are then due (and if such money is insufficient to pay all such Obligations, first to any reimbursements due to Administrative Agent under Section 6.9 or 10.4 and then to the partial payment of all other Obligations then due in proportion to the amounts thereof, or as Lender Parties shall otherwise agree).All payments applied to principal or interest shall be applied first to any interest then due and payable, then to principal then due and payable, and last to any prepayment of principal and interest in compliance with Sections 2.6 and 2.7.  All distributions of amounts described above shall be made by Administrative Agent pro rata to each Lender Party then owed Obligations in proportion to all amounts owed to all Lender Parties; provided that if any Lender then owes payments to LC Issuer for the purchase of a participation under Section 2.11(c) or to Administrative Agent under Section 10.4(c), any amounts otherwise distributable under this section to such Lender shall be deemed to belong to LC Issuer, or Administrative Agent, respectively, to the extent of such unpaid payments, and Administrative Agent shall apply such amounts to make such unpaid payments rather than distribute such amounts to such Lender.Section 3.2.    Increased Costs.(a)    Increased Costs Generally.  If any Change in Law shall:(i)    impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any Reserve Requirement reflected in the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate) or LC Issuer; (ii)    subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) with respect to this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, any participation in any Letter of Credit, any Commitment, any Eurodollar Loan made by it, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities, or capital attributable thereto; or(iii)    impose on any Lender or LC Issuer or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein (other than with respect to Excluded Taxes or Indemnified Taxes addressed in Section 3.5); and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender or LC Issuer of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or LC Issuer hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender or LC Issuer, Borrower will pay to such Lender or LC Issuer within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of such notice and demand, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or LC Issuer, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.(b)    Capital Requirements.  If any Lender or LC Issuer determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or LC Issuer or any lending office of such Lender or such Lender’s or LC Issuer’s holding company, if any, regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s or LC Issuer’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s or LC Issuer’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by LC Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or LC Issuer or such Lender’s or LC Issuer’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s or LC Issuer’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s or LC Issuer’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time with written notice and demand with respect to such reduced amounts, and within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of such notice and demand, Borrower will pay to such Lender or LC Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or LC Issuer or such Lender’s or LC Issuer’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.(c)    Certificates for Reimbursement.  A certificate of a Lender or LC Issuer setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or LC Issuer or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsections (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  (d)    Delay in Requests.  Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or LC Issuer to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s or LC Issuer’s right to demand such compensation, provided that Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or LC Issuer pursuant to this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than 9 months prior to the date that such Lender or LC Issuer, as the case may be, notifies Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s or LC Issuer’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 9 month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).Section 3.3.    Illegality.  If any Change in Law after the date hereof shall make it unlawful for any Lender to fund or maintain Eurodollar Loans, then, upon notice by such Lender Party to Borrower and Administrative Agent until such Lender notifies Administrative Agent and Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, (a) Borrower’s right to elect Eurodollar Loans from such Lender Party shall be suspended to the extent and for the duration of such illegality, (b) all Eurodollar Loans of such Lender Party that are then the subject of any Borrowing Notice and that cannot be lawfully funded shall be funded as Base Rate Loans of such Lender Party, and (c) all Eurodollar Loans of such Lender Party shall be converted automatically to Base Rate Loans on the respective last days of the then current Interest Periods with respect to such Loans or within such earlier period as required by Law.  If any such conversion of a Eurodollar Loan occurs on a day that is not the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto, Borrower shall pay to such Lender Party such amounts, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 3.4.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the affected Lender shall, prior to giving such notice to Administrative Agent, designate a different Applicable Lending Officer if such designation would avoid the need for giving such notice and if such designation would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender in the good faith exercise of its discretion.Section 3.4.    Funding Losses.  In addition to its other obligations hereunder, Borrower will reimburse each Lender within ten (10) Business Days after written demand from such Lender for any loss or expense incurred or sustained by such Lender (including any loss or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by a Lender to fund or maintain Eurodollar Loans), as a result of (a) any payment or prepayment (whether authorized or required hereunder or otherwise) of all or a portion of a Eurodollar Loan on a day other than the day on which the applicable Interest Period ends, (b) any payment or prepayment, whether required hereunder or otherwise, of a Loan made after the delivery, but before the effective date, of a Continuation/Conversion Notice requesting the continuation of outstanding Eurodollar Loans as, or the conversion of outstanding Base Rate Loans to, Eurodollar Loans, if such payment or prepayment prevents such Continuation/ Conversion Notice from becoming fully effective, (c) the failure of any Loan to be made or of any Continuation/Conversion Notice requesting the continuation of outstanding Eurodollar Loans as, or the conversion of outstanding Base Rate Loans to, Eurodollar Loans to become effective due to any condition precedent not being satisfied or due to any other action or inaction of any Restricted Person, (d) any Conversion (whether authorized or required hereunder or otherwise) of all or any portion of any Eurodollar Loan into a Base Rate Loan or into a different Eurodollar Loan on a day other than the day on which the applicable Interest Period ends, or (e) any assignment of a Eurodollar Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by Borrower pursuant to Section 3.7(b).Section 3.5.    Taxes.(a)    LC Issuer.  For purposes of this Section 3.5, the term “Lender” includes any LC Issuer and the term “applicable Law” includes FATCA.(b)    Payments Free of Taxes.  Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable Law.  If any applicable Law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then (i) the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law and, (ii) if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.(c)    Payment of Other Taxes by Borrower.  Without limiting the provisions of subsection (b) above, Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law, or at the option of Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.(d)    Indemnification by Borrower.  Borrower shall indemnify each Recipient, within 10 Business Days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority; provided that Recipient has made written demand within 180 days of the date on which Recipient received written notice of such Indemnified Tax from the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to Administrative Agent), or by Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.(e)    Indemnification by Lenders.  Each Lender shall severally indemnify Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that Borrower has not already indemnified Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of Borrower to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 10.5(d) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Lender hereby authorizes Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to Administrative Agent under this subsection (e).(f)    Evidence of Payments.  As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by Borrower to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 3.5, Borrower shall deliver to Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent.(g)    Status of Lenders.

In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by Borrower or Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable Law or reasonably requested by Borrower or Administrative Agent as will enable Borrower or Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 3.5(g)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(C) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.(ii)    Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:(A)    Any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to Borrower and Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of Borrower or Administrative Agent), executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 (or any successor form thereto) certifying that such Lender is exempt from United States federal backup withholding tax.(B)    Any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to Borrower and Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of Borrower or Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:(I)    in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or any successor form thereto) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, United States federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or any successor form thereto) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, United States federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty;(II)    executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI (or any successor form thereto);(III)    in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under section 881(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, (x) a certificate to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of Borrower within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code, or (C) a “controlled foreign corporation” that is related to Borrower within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code and (y) executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or any successor form thereto);(IV)    any other form prescribed by applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States Federal withholding tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Law to permit Borrower or Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; or(V)    if any Lender is not the beneficial owner, duly executed originals of IR Form W-8IMY (or any successor form thereto) accompanied by IRS Form W-9, IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8ECI, certifications required under Section 3.5(g)(B)(III), any applicable withholding statement or certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable.(C)    If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to United States federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to Borrower and Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by Law and at such time or times reasonably requested by Borrower or Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by Borrower or Administrative Agent as may be necessary for Borrower and Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this clause (C), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.  Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify Borrower and Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.(h)    Treatment of Certain Refunds.  If any party determines, in its discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 3.5 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.5), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section 3.5 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund).  Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this subsection (h) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection (h), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this subsection (h) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid.  This subsection shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.(i)    Survival.  Each party’s obligations under this Section 3.5 shall survive the resignation or replacement of Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.Section 3.6.    Alternative Rate of Interest.  If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans:(c)    Administrative Agent determines that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period (any such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error); or(a)    Administrative Agent is advised by Required Lenders that the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;then Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to Borrower and Lenders by telephone or facsimile as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until Administrative Agent notifies Borrower and Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Continuation/Conversion Notice that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans shall be ineffective and shall be deemed a request to continue such Borrowing as a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans and (ii) if any Borrowing Notice requests a Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans, such Borrowing shall be made as a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans.  Upon receipt of such notice, Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Loans.Section 3.7.    Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.(a)    Designation of a Different Lending Office.  If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.2, or requires Borrower to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.5, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.2 or 3.5, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.  Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.(b)    Replacement of Lenders.   If (a) any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, or if any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.2, or if Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.5, or (b) any Lender withholds its consent (when all other required consents have been obtained), then Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 10.5), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), provided that:(i)    Borrower shall have paid to Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in Section 10.5;(ii)    such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in Matured LC Obligations, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 3.4) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);(iii)    in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 3.2 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 3.5, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; and(iv)    such assignment does not conflict with applicable law.A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.Section 3.8.    Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent.  Unless Administrative Agent shall have received notice from Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to Administrative Agent for the account of Lenders or LC Issuer hereunder that Borrower will not make such payment, Administrative Agent may assume that Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or LC Issuer, as the case may be, the amount due.  In such event, if Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or LC Issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or LC Issuer, with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.ARTICLE IV -    Conditions Precedent to LendingSection 4.1.    Closing Date Conditions.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Administrative Agent:(l)    shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing;(m)    shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents), provided that Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law; (n)    shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity; and(o)    shall not be responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any failure of any Restricted Person to perform its obligations hereunder or in any other Loan Document.Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Sections 10.1 and 8.2) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.  Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice describing such Default is given to Administrative Agent by Borrower, a Lender or LC Issuer.Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to Administrative Agent.Section 9.3.    Reliance by Administrative Agent.  Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person.  Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.  In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or LC Issuer, Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or LC Issuer unless Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or LC Issuer prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit.  Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.  Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes unless a notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall have been filed with Administrative Agent.  Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of Required Lenders, as it deems appropriate or as otherwise required by Sections 8.2 or 10.1 or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.  Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents in accordance with a request of Required Lenders, or as otherwise required by Sections 8.2 or 10.1 and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all of the Lenders and all future holders of the Loans and all other Obligations.Section 9.4.    Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders.  Each Lender and LC Issuer acknowledges that (a) it has, independently and without reliance upon Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement and (b) none of Administrative Agent nor any of its respective officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates has made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by Administrative Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of any Restricted Person or any audit or due diligence review prepared by the internal auditor of Administrative Agent, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by Administrative Agent to any Lender or LC Issuer.  Each Lender and LC Issuer also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.  Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by Administrative Agent hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, Administrative Agent shall have no duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of Borrower which may come into the possession of Administrative Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys in fact or Affiliates.Section 9.5.    Rights as a Lender.  The Person serving as Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not Administrative Agent and the term “Lender” or “Lenders” shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity.  Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.Section 9.6.    Investments.  Whenever Administrative Agent in good faith determines that it is uncertain about how to distribute to Lender Parties any funds that it has received, or whenever Administrative Agent in good faith determines that there is any dispute among Lender Parties about how such funds should be distributed, Administrative Agent may choose to defer distribution of the funds that are the subject of such uncertainty or dispute.  If Administrative Agent in good faith believes that the uncertainty or dispute will not be promptly resolved, or if Administrative Agent is otherwise required to invest funds pending distribution to Lender Parties, Administrative Agent shall invest such funds pending distribution; all interest on any such Investment shall be distributed upon the distribution of such Investment and in the same proportion and to the same Persons as such Investment.  All moneys received by Administrative Agent for distribution to Lender Parties (other than to the Person who is Administrative Agent in its separate capacity as a Lender Party) shall be held by Administrative Agent pending such distribution solely as Administrative Agent for such Lender Parties, and Administrative Agent shall have no equitable title to any portion thereof.Section 9.7.    Resignation of Administrative Agent.  Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders, LC Issuer and Borrower.  Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, Required Lenders shall have the right, subject, so long as no Event of Default exists, to the consent of Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States.  If no such successor shall have been so appointed by Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may on behalf of the Lenders and LC Issuer and in consultation with Borrower, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above provided that if Administrative Agent shall notify Borrower and the Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (1) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any Collateral held by Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders or LC Issuer under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such Collateral until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and (2) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender and LC Issuer directly, until such time as Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above in this Section.  Upon the acceptance of a successor’s appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section).  The fees payable by Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between Borrower and such successor.  After the retiring Administrative Agent’s resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and Section 10.4 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent.Section 9.8.    Delegation of Duties.  Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents or attorneys-in-fact appointed by Administrative Agent.  Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent or attorney-in-fact may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties.  Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care.  The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent or attorney-in-fact and to the Related Parties of Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent or attorney-in-fact, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.Section 9.9.    No Other Duties, etc.  Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the “Arranger,” “Syndication Agent” or “Documentation Agent” listed on the cover page hereof shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as Administrative Agent, a Lender or LC Issuer hereunder.Section 9.10.    Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim.  In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to any Restricted Person, Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or LC Obligation shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise(a)    to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, LC Obligations and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of Lenders, LC Issuer and Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of Lenders, LC Issuer and Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due Lenders, LC Issuer and Administrative Agent under Sections 2.5 and 10.4) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and(b)    to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender and LC Issuer to make such payments to Administrative Agent and, in the event that Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to Lenders and LC Issuer, to pay to Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due Administrative Agent under Sections 2.5 and 10.4.  Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender or LC Issuer any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or to authorize Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding.Section 9.11.    Guaranty Matters.  Each Lender and LC Issuer hereby irrevocably authorizes Administrative Agent, at its option and in its discretion, to release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty (i) if such Person ceases to be a Subsidiary as a result of a transaction permitted hereunder and (ii) upon termination of each Lender’s Commitment and payment in full of all Obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations) and the expiration or termination of all Letters of Credit.  Upon request by Administrative Agent at any time, each Lender and LC Issuer will confirm in writing Administrative Agent’s authority to release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Subsidiary Guaranty pursuant to this Section 9.11.Section 9.12.    Collateral Matters.(c)    Each Lender and LC Issuer hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs Administrative Agent to enter into the Security Documents for the benefit of such Lender and LC Issuer.  Each Lender and LC Issuer hereby agrees, and each holder of any Note by the acceptance thereof will be deemed to agree, that, except as otherwise set forth in Section 10.1, any action taken by the Required Lenders, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or the Security Documents, and the exercise by the Required Lenders of the powers set forth herein or therein, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto, shall be authorized and binding upon all of Lenders and LC Issuer.  Administrative Agent is hereby authorized (but not obligated) on behalf of all of Lenders and LC Issuer, without the necessity of any notice to or further consent from any Lender or LC Issuer from time to time, prior to an Event of Default, to take any action with respect to any Collateral or Security Documents that may be necessary to perfect and maintain perfected the Liens upon the Collateral granted pursuant to the Security Documents.(d)    Each Lender and LC Issuer hereby irrevocably authorize Administrative Agent, at its option and in its discretion, (i)    to release any Lien on any property granted to or held by Administrative Agent under any Loan Document (A) upon termination of each Lender’s Commitment and payment in full of all Obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations) and the expiration or termination of all Letters of Credit, (B) that is sold or to be sold as part of or in connection with any sale permitted hereunder or under any other Loan Document, (C) subject to Section 10.1, if approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the Required Lenders, or (D) in connection with any foreclosure sale or other disposition of Collateral after the occurrence of an Event of Default; and(ii)    to subordinate any Lien on any property granted to or held by Administrative Agent under any Loan Document to the holder of any Lien on such property that is permitted by this Agreement or any other Loan Document.Upon request by Administrative Agent at any time, each Lender and LC Issuer will confirm in writing Administrative Agent’s authority to release or subordinate its interest in particular types or items of Collateral pursuant to this Section 9.12, provided that, the absence of any such confirmation for whatever reason shall not affect Administrative Agent’s rights under this Section 9.12.(e)    Subject to subsection (b) above, Administrative Agent shall (and is hereby irrevocably authorized by each Lender and LC Issuer to) execute such documents as may be necessary to evidence the release or subordination of the Liens granted to Administrative Agent for the benefit of Administrative Agent and Lenders and LC Issuer herein or pursuant hereto upon the applicable Collateral; provided that (i) Administrative Agent shall not be required to execute any such document on terms that, in Administrative Agent’s opinion, would expose Administrative Agent to or create any liability or entail any consequence other than the release or subordination of such Liens without recourse or warranty and (ii) such release or subordination shall not in any manner discharge, affect or impair the Obligations or any Liens upon (or obligations of Borrower or any other Restricted Person in respect of) all interests retained by Borrower or any other Restricted Person, including the proceeds of the sale, all of which shall continue to constitute part of the Collateral.  In the event of any sale or transfer of Collateral, or any foreclosure with respect to any of the Collateral, Administrative Agent shall be authorized to deduct all expenses reasonably incurred by Administrative Agent from the proceeds of any such sale, transfer or foreclosure.(f)    Administrative Agent shall have no obligation whatsoever to any Lender, LC Issuer or any other Person to assure that the Collateral exists or is owned by Borrower or any other Restricted Person or is cared for, protected or insured or that the Liens granted to Administrative Agent herein or in any of the Security Documents or pursuant hereto or thereto have been properly or sufficiently or lawfully created, perfected, protected or enforced or are entitled to any particular priority, or to exercise or to continue exercising at all or in any manner or under any duty of care, disclosure or fidelity any of the rights, authorities and powers granted or available to Administrative Agent in this Section 9.12 or in any of the Security Documents, it being understood and agreed that in respect of the Collateral, or any act, omission or event related thereto, Administrative Agent may act in any manner it may deem appropriate, in its discretion, given Administrative Agent’s own interest in the Collateral as one of Lenders and that Administrative Agent shall have no duty or liability whatsoever to Lenders or LC Issuer.(g)    Each Lender and LC Issuer hereby appoints each other Lender as agent for the purpose of perfecting Lenders’ and LC Issuer’s security interest in assets that, in accordance with Article 9 of the UCC, can be perfected only by possession.  Should any Lender or LC Issuer (other than Administrative Agent) obtain possession of any such Collateral, such Lender or LC Issuer shall notify Administrative Agent thereof, and, promptly upon Administrative Agent’s request therefor shall deliver such Collateral to Administrative Agent or in accordance with Administrative Agent’s instructions.    Section 9.13.    Agreement to Assignment of ISDA Master Agreement.  Each Lender hereby agrees (on behalf of itself and any of its Affiliates party to  Hedging Contract with any Restricted Person) that the rights of the Restricted Persons under Hedging Contracts with such Lender (or, if applicable, its Affiliate) may be included in the Collateral. Section 9.14.    Notice of Default.  Administrative Agent shall be deemed to have no knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default hereunder unless Administrative Agent has received notice from a Lender or Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a “notice of default.”  In the event that Administrative Agent receives such a notice, Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lenders.  Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders; provided that unless and until Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders.Section 9.15.    Lender Hedging Obligations and Cash Management Obligations.  Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein or in any Loan Document, no Lender Counterparty or Cash Management Lender that obtains the benefits of Section 8.3 or any Loan Document by virtue of the provisions hereof or thereof shall have any right to notice of any action or to consent to, direct or object to any action hereunder or under any other Loan Document or otherwise in respect of the Collateral (including the release or impairment of any Collateral) other than in its capacity as a Lender and, in such case, only to the extent expressly provided in the Loan Documents.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article IX to the contrary, Administrative Agent shall not be required to verify the payment of, or that other satisfactory arrangements have been made with respect to, obligations arising under Lender Hedging Obligations and Cash Management Obligations unless Administrative Agent has received written notice of such obligations, together with such supporting documentation as Administrative Agent may request, from the applicable Lender Counterparty or Cash Management Lender, as the case may be.ARTICLE X -    MiscellaneousSection 10.1.    Waivers and Amendments; Acknowledgments.(p)    Waivers and Amendments.  No failure or delay (whether by course of conduct or otherwise) by any Lender in exercising any right, power or remedy that such Lender Party may have under any of the Loan Documents shall operate as a waiver thereof or of any other right, power or remedy, nor shall any single or partial exercise by any Lender Party of any such right, power or remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other right, power or remedy.

Borrower shall indemnify Administrative Agent (and any sub-agent thereof), each Lender and LC Issuer, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an “Indemnitee”) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses (including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee), incurred by any Indemnitee or asserted against any Indemnitee by any third party or by Borrower or any other Restricted Person arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or thereunder or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use or proposed use of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by LC Issuer to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned or operated by Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any environmental liability related in any way to Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory, whether brought by a third party or by Borrower or any other LC Issuer, and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto, provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee party or the breach in bad faith of such Indemnitee’s obligations under any Loan Document.  THE FOREGOING INDEMNIFICATION WILL APPLY WHETHER OR NOT SUCH LIABILITIES AND COSTS ARE IN ANY WAY OR TO ANY EXTENT OWED, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, UNDER ANY CLAIM OR THEORY OF STRICT LIABILITY OR CAUSED, IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY ANY NEGLIGENT ACT OR OMISSION OF ANY KIND BY ANY INDEMNITEE.(g)    Reimbursement by Lenders.  To the extent that any Restricted Person for any reason fails to indefeasibly pay any amount required under subsection (a) or (b) of this Section to be paid by it to Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent thereof), LC Issuer or any Related Party of any of the foregoing, each Lender severally agrees to pay to Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), LC Issuer or such Related Party, as the case may be, such Lender’s Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount, provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) or LC Issuer in its capacity as such, or against any Related Party of any of the foregoing acting for Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) or LC Issuer in connection with such capacity.  The obligations of the Lenders under this subsection (c) are subject to the provisions of Section 2.15.(h)    Waiver of Consequential Damages, Etc.  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no party hereto shall assert, and each party hereto hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof.  No Indemnitee referred to in subsection (b) above shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials distributed by it through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby absent gross negligence or willful misconduct by such Indemnitee.(i)    Payments.  All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later than 10 Business Days after demand therefor.Section 10.5.    Successors and Assigns; Joint and Several Liability.(e)    Successors and Assigns Generally.  The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that neither Borrower nor any other Restricted Person may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under any Loan Document without the prior written consent of Administrative Agent and each Lender and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an Eligible Assignee in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this Section, (ii) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of this Section or (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of subsection (f) of this Section (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void).  Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in subsection (d) of this Section and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.(f)    Assignments by Lenders.  Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it); provided that(vi)    except in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender’s Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to a Lender, the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) or, if the applicable Commitment is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to Administrative Agent or, if “Trade Date” is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date) shall not be less than $5,000,000, unless each of Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Borrower otherwise consent (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed);(vii)    each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loan or the Commitment assigned;(viii)    any assignment of a Commitment must be approved by Administrative Agent and LC Issuer (such consents not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), unless the Person that is the proposed assignee is itself a Lender with a Commitment or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund (whether or not the proposed assignee would otherwise qualify as an Eligible Assignee); (ix)    the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with the Note (if any) subject to such assignment and a processing and recordation fee of $4,000, and the Eligible Assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire in form satisfactory to Administrative Agent; and(x)    no such assignment shall be made (x) to Borrower or any of Borrower’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries, or (y) to any Defaulting Lender or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in this clause (y), or (z) to a natural person.  Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits, and subject to the requirements of, of Sections 3.2, 3.4, 3.5 and 10.4 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 10.5, (1) the consent of Borrower and its execution of an Assignment and Acceptance shall not be required, and, unless requested by the Eligible Assignee and/or the assigning Lender, new Notes shall not be required to be executed and delivered by Borrower, for any assignment which occurs at any time when any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and (2) Administrative Agent and Borrower shall not unreasonably withhold or delay in providing any consent or executing any Assignment and Acceptance otherwise required under this Section 10.5.  Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section.(g)    Register.  Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in New York City a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of Lenders and the Applicable Percentages of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (in this section called the “Register”).  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and Borrower and each Lender Party may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender hereunder for all purposes.  Any assignment of any Loan or other Obligation hereunder, whether or not evidenced by a Note, shall be effective only upon appropriate entries with respect thereto being made in the Register.  In addition, Administrative Agent shall maintain on the Register information regarding the designation, and revocation of designation, of any Lender as a Defaulting Lender.   The Register shall be available for inspection by Borrower or any Lender Party at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.(h)    Participations.  Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, Borrower or Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person, a Defaulting Lender or Borrower or any of Borrower’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its commitment and/or the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) Borrower, Administrative Agent and the Lenders and LC Issuer shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement.Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the fifth sentence of Section 10.1(a) that affects such Participant.  Subject to subsection (e) of this Section, Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of, and subject to the requirements of, Sections 3.2, 3.4 and 3.5 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 3.5(f) shall be delivered to the participating Lender).  To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 6.14 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.14 as though it were a Lender.Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the “Participant Register”).  The Participant Register shall be available for inspection by Administrative Agent or Borrower at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice; provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant's interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of doubt, Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.(i)    Limitations upon Participant Rights.  A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 3.2 and 3.5 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation.  (j)    Certain Pledges.  Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.(k)    Joint and Several Liability.  All Obligations that are incurred by two or more Restricted Persons shall be their joint and several obligations and liabilities.  (l)    Certain Additional Payments.  In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of Borrower and Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon) and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit in accordance with its Applicable Percentage.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable Law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.  Section 10.6.    Confidentiality.  Each of Administrative Agent, the Lenders and LC Issuer agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates and to its and its Affiliates’ respective partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors and other representatives (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have jurisdiction over it (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party hereto, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to Borrower and its obligations, (g) with the consent of Borrower or (h) to the extent such Information (x) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (y) becomes available to Administrative Agent, any Lender, LC Issuer or any of their respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than a Restricted Person.For purposes of this Section, “Information” means all information received from Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries relating to Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to Administrative Agent, any Lender or LC Issuer on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, provided that, in the case of information received from Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential.  Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information. Section 10.7.    Governing Law; Submission to Process.(a)    GOVERNING LAW.  THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.(b)    SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION.  EACH PARTY HERETO IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY SUBMITS, FOR ITSELF AND ITS PROPERTY, TO THE NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK SITTING IN NEW YORK COUNTY AND OF THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT OF THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, AND ANY APPELLATE COURT FROM ANY THEREOF, IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, OR FOR RECOGNITION OR ENFORCEMENT OF ANY JUDGMENT, AND EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY AGREES THAT ALL CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY BE HEARD AND DETERMINED IN SUCH NEW YORK STATE COURT OR, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN SUCH FEDERAL COURT.  EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO AGREES THAT A FINAL JUDGMENT IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE CONCLUSIVE AND MAY BE ENFORCED IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS BY SUIT ON THE JUDGMENT OR IN ANY OTHER MANNER PROVIDED BY LAW.  NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT OR IN ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT SHALL AFFECT ANY RIGHT THAT ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, ANY LENDER OR LC ISSUER MAY OTHERWISE HAVE TO BRING ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT AGAINST BORROWER OR ANY OTHER RESTRICTED PERSON OR ITS PROPERTIES IN THE COURTS OF ANY JURISDICTION.(c)    WAIVER OF VENUE.  EACH PARTY HERETO IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY OBJECTION THAT IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT IN ANY COURT REFERRED TO IN PARAGRAPH (B) OF THIS SECTION.  EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE DEFENSE OF AN INCONVENIENT FORUM TO THE MAINTENANCE OF SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN ANY SUCH COURT.(d)    SERVICE OF PROCESS.  EACH PARTY HERETO IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO SERVICE OF PROCESS IN THE MANNER PROVIDED FOR NOTICES IN SECTION 10.3.  NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT WILL AFFECT THE RIGHT OF ANY PARTY HERETO TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.Section 10.8.    Limitation on Interest.  Lender Parties, Restricted Persons and the other parties to the Loan Documents intend to contract in strict compliance with applicable usury Law from time to time in effect.  In furtherance thereof such Persons stipulate and agree that none of the terms and provisions contained in the Loan Documents shall ever be construed to create a contract to pay, for the use, forbearance or detention of money, interest in excess of the maximum amount of interest permitted to be charged by applicable Law from time to time in effect.  Neither any Restricted Person nor any present or future guarantors, endorsers, or other Persons hereafter becoming liable for payment of any Obligation shall ever be liable for unearned interest thereon or shall ever be required to pay interest thereon in excess of the maximum amount that may be lawfully contracted for, charged, or received under applicable Law from time to time in effect, and the provisions of this section shall control over all other provisions of the Loan Documents that may be in conflict or apparent conflict herewith.Section 10.9.    Severability.  If any term or provision of any Loan Document shall be determined to be illegal or unenforceable all other terms and provisions of the Loan Documents shall nevertheless remain effective and shall be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law.  Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 10.9, if and to the extent that the enforceability of any provisions in this Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by Debtor Relief Laws, as determined in good faith by Administrative Agent or LC Issuer, as applicable, then such provisions shall be deemed to be in effect only to the extent not so limited.Section 10.10.    Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness.  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract.  This Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to Administrative Agent, constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof.  Except as provided in Section 4.1, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by Administrative Agent and when Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto.  Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy or electronic mail shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.Section 10.11.    Waiver of Jury Trial, Punitive Damages, etc.  EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, (A) ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY), AND (B) ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO CLAIM OR RECOVER IN ANY SUCH LEGAL PROCEEDING ANY “SPECIAL DAMAGES,” AS DEFINED BELOW.  EACH PARTY HERETO (X) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PERSON HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PERSON WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (Y) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.  AS USED IN THIS SECTION, “SPECIAL DAMAGES” INCLUDES ALL SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (REGARDLESS OF HOW NAMED), BUT DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY PAYMENTS OR FUNDS THAT ANY PARTY HERETO HAS EXPRESSLY PROMISED TO PAY OR DELIVER TO ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO.Section 10.12.    No Advisory or Fiduciary Responsibility.  In connection with all aspects of each transaction contemplated by this Agreement, Borrower and each other Restricted Person acknowledges and agrees, and acknowledges its Affiliates’ understanding, that: (i) the credit facilities provided for hereunder and any related services in connection therewith (including in connection with any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Loan Document) are an arm’s-length commercial transaction between Borrower, each other Restricted Person and their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and Administrative Agent, on the other hand, and Borrower and each other Restricted Person is capable of evaluating and understanding and understands and accepts the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Loan Documents (including any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or thereof); (ii) in connection with the process leading to such transaction, Administrative Agent is and has been acting solely as a principal and is not the financial advisor, agent or fiduciary, for Borrower, any other Restricted Person or any of their respective Affiliates, stockholders, creditors or employees or any other Person; (iii) Administrative Agent has neither assumed nor will assume an advisory, agency or fiduciary responsibility in favor of Borrower or any other Restricted Person with respect to any of the transactions contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto, including with respect to any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Loan Document (irrespective of whether Administrative Agent has advised or is currently advising Borrower, any other Restricted Person or any of their respective Affiliates on other matters) and Administrative Agent has no obligation to Borrower, any other Restricted Person or any of their respective Affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby except those obligations expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents; (iv) Administrative Agent and its Affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of Borrower, the other Restricted Persons and their respective Affiliates, and Administrative Agent has no obligation to disclose any of such interests by virtue of any advisory, agency or fiduciary relationship; and (v) Administrative Agent will not provide any legal, accounting, regulatory or tax advice with respect to any of the transactions contemplated hereby (including any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Loan Document) and each of Borrower and the other Restricted Persons has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it has deemed appropriate.  Each of Borrower and the other Restricted Persons hereby waives and releases, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims that it may have against Administrative Agent with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty.Section 10.13.     USA PATRIOT Act Notice.  Each Lender that is subject to the Act (as hereinafter defined) and Administrative Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies Borrower and each other Restricted Person that pursuant to the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001) (the “Act”)), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies Borrower and each other Restricted Person, which information includes the name and address of Borrower and each other Restricted Person and other information that will allow such Lender or Administrative Agent, as applicable, to identify Borrower and each other Restricted Person in accordance with the Act. Section 10.14.    Right of Setoff.  If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender, LC Issuer and each of their respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by such Lender, LC Issuer or any such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of Borrower or any other Restricted Person against any and all of the obligations of Borrower or such Restricted Person due and payable under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to such Lender or LC Issuer, irrespective of whether or not such Lender or LC Issuer shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such obligations of Borrower or such Restricted Person are owed to a branch or office of such Lender or LC Issuer different from the branch or office holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness; provided, that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.17 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff.  The rights of each Lender, LC Issuer and their respective Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender, LC Issuer or their respective Affiliates may have.  Each Lender and LC Issuer agrees to notify Borrower and Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. Section 10.15.    Release of Collateral and Guarantee Obligations.(a)    Upon any sale or other transfer of any Collateral by any Restricted Person that is permitted under the Loan Documents and request by Borrower for such release, Administrative Agent shall release the Lien in such Collateral (but not the proceeds thereof) subject to any required application of proceeds in accordance with the Loan Documents and Administrative Agent shall release any guarantee obligations under any Loan Document of any Person being Disposed of in such Disposition, in each case, to the extent necessary to permit consummation of such Disposition in accordance with the Loan Documents.(b)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or any other Loan Document, when all Secured Obligations have been paid in full, all Commitments have terminated or expired and any Letter of Credit has been terminated, replaced or Cash Collateralized, upon request of Borrower, Administrative Agent shall (without notice to, or vote or consent of, any Lender) take such actions as shall be required to release (without recourse to or representation or warranty by Administrative Agent) its security interest in all Collateral, and to release all guarantee obligations under any Loan Document.  Any such release of guarantee obligations shall be deemed subject to the provision that such guarantee obligations shall be reinstated if after such release any portion of any payment in respect of the Secured Obligations guaranteed thereby shall be rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of Borrower or any Guarantor, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, Borrower or any Guarantor or any substantial part of its property, or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made.[THE REMAINDER OF THIS PAGE IS INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK]IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement is executed as of the date first written above.EUREKA HUNTER PIPELINE, LLC, Borrower   By:      /s/ Joseph C.

The incident occurred during a pigging operation at a natural gas receiving station. Two employees of third-party contractors received fatal injuries. Another employee of a third-party contractor was injured. In mid-February 2014, the estate of one of the deceased third-party contractor employees sued Eureka Hunter Pipeline and certain other parties in Karen S. Phipps v. Eureka Hunter Pipeline, LLC et al., Civil Action No. 14-C-41, in the Circuit Court of Ohio County, West Virginia. The plaintiff alleges that Eureka Hunter Pipeline and the other defendants engaged in certain negligent and reckless conduct which resulted in the wrongful death of the third party contractor employee. The plaintiff has demanded judgment for an unspecified amount of compensatory, general and punitive damages. A pre-suit settlement demand has also been received from another potential claimant. Investigation regarding the incident is ongoing. It is not possible to predict at this juncture the extent to which, if at all, Eureka Hunter Pipeline or any related entities will incur liability or damages because of this incident. However, we believe our insurance will be sufficient to cover any losses or liabilities we may incur as a result of this incident.SCHEDULE 5.10ERISA PLANS AND LIABILITESNone.SCHEDULE 5.11ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER LAWSOn August 5, 2013, Eureka Hunter Pipeline, LLC received an information request from the U.S. EPA seeking information about the fire at its Twin Hickory Pigging Station, and pertaining to section 104 of CERCLA and section 114 of the Clean Air Act.  Eureka Hunter Pipeline, LLC responded on September 25, 2013, disclaiming any storage of hazardous materials or release as defined under either law, and has heard nothing since.SCHEDULE 5.12NAMES AND PLACES OF BUSINESSEureka Hunter Pipeline, LLCEureka Hunter Pipeline, LLC was formed on January 12, 2010 as Eureka Hunter, LLC.
