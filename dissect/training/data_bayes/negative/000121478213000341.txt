THE MORTGAGOR IRREVOCABLY APPOINTS THE SECURED PARTY AS THE MORTGAGOR’S AGENT AND ATTORNEY-IN-FACT, FOR THE PURPOSE OF EXECUTING ANY TRANSFER ORDERS, PAYMENT ORDERS, DIVISION ORDERS, RECEIPTS, RELEASES, OR OTHER INSTRUMENTS (COLLECTIVELY, “RECEIPTS”) THAT THE SECURED PARTY DEEMS REASONABLY NECESSARY IN ORDER FOR THE SECURED PARTY TO DEMAND, COLLECT, RECEIVE, AND DELIVER RECEIPTS FOR PRODUCTION AND PROCEEDS DURING THE CONTINUANCE OF AN EVENT OF DEFAULT.  In addition, the Mortgagor agrees that, upon the Secured Party’s request, the Mortgagor shall promptly execute and deliver to the Secured Party such Receipts as the Secured Party may deem reasonably necessary in connection with the payment and delivery directly to the Secured Party of all Production and Proceeds and to effectuate the purposes of this paragraph.  All parties producing, purchasing, or receiving any Production or having Production or Proceeds in their possession for which they or others are accountable to the Secured Party by virtue of the provisions of this Article are authorized and directed to treat and regard the Secured Party as the assignee and transferee of the Mortgagor and entitled in the Mortgagor’s place and stead to receive Production and Proceeds; and said parties and each of them shall be fully protected in so treating and regarding the Secured Party and shall be under no obligation to see to the application by the Secured Party of any Production or Proceeds received by it.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Secured Party, has agreed not to exercise her right to directly receive delivery of Production and payment of Proceeds immediately.  Rather, each party producing, purchasing, or receiving Production may continue to make such deliveries or payments to the Mortgagor until such time as such party has received notice from the Secured Party that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and that such party is directed to make delivery or payment directly to the Secured Party.

3.2           Application of Proceeds.  All payments received by the Secured Party pursuant to Section 3.1 hereof shall be applied in the manner determined by the Secured Party in her sole discretion unless otherwise provided in the Note or the Letter Loan Agreement, but in all cases subject to the provisions of Section 5.9 of this Mortgage.




3.3           No Liability of the Secured Party in Collecting.  The Secured Party is hereby absolved from all liability for failure to enforce collection of any proceeds so assigned (and no such failure shall be deemed to be a waiver of any right of the Secured Party under this Article) and from all other responsibility in connection therewith, except the responsibility to account to the Mortgagor for funds actually received.




3.4           Assignment Not a Restriction on the Secured Party’s Rights.  Nothing herein contained shall detract from or limit the absolute obligation of the Mortgagor to make payment of the Secured Obligations regardless of whether the proceeds assigned by this Article would be sufficient to pay the same, and the rights under this Article shall be in addition to all other security now or hereafter existing to secure the payment of the Secured Obligations.




3.5           Status of Assignment.  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article and in addition to the other rights hereunder, the Trustee, the Secured Party, or any receiver appointed in judicial proceedings for the enforcement of this instrument shall have the right to receive all of the Production and Proceeds after the Secured Obligations have been declared due and payable, either through an Event of Default or through any other applicable provision of any of the Loan Documents, and to apply all of the proceeds as provided in Section 3.2 above.  Upon any sale of the Mortgaged Property or any part thereof pursuant to Article V, the Hydrocarbons thereafter produced from the property so sold, and the proceeds therefrom, shall be included in such sale and shall pass to the purchaser free and clear of the assignment contained in this Article.




3.6           Indemnity.  The Mortgagor shall indemnify the Trustee and the Secured Party, and their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, counsel, agents, and attorneys-in-fact, or any of the foregoing Persons (each of these Person are called an “Indemnitee” for purposes of this Section 3.6) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, actions, liabilities, judgments, costs, and related expenses, including the reasonable fees, charges, and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, (i) the assertion, either before or after the payment in full of the Secured Obligations, that any Indemnitee received Production or Proceeds claimed by third persons, or (ii) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation, or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort, or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee (IT BEING UNDERSTOOD THAT IT IS THE INTENTION OF THE PARTIES HERETO THAT ALL OF THE INDEMNITEES BE INDEMNIFIED IN THE CASE OF THEIR OWN NEGLIGENCE (OTHER THAN GROSS NEGLIGENCE), REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH NEGLIGENCE IS SOLE OR CONTRIBUTORY, ACTIVE OR PASSIVE, IMPUTED, JOINT, OR TECHNICAL).  All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later than thirty (30) days after written demand therefor.  The obligations of the Mortgagor as herein set forth in this Section shall survive the release, termination, foreclosure, or assignment of this instrument or any sale hereunder.  Notwithstanding the foregoing indemnity, it is expressly provided that the assignment of Production under Section 3.1 is made in favor of the Secured Party, and only the Secured Party may exercise the right to demand, collect, receive, and deliver receipts for Production and Proceeds.

B.                      The Trustee is hereby authorized and empowered to sell the Mortgaged Property at public sale to the highest bidder for cash in the area at the county courthouse of the county in which the Mortgaged Property or any part thereof is situated, as herein described, designated by such county’s commissioner’s court for such proceedings, or if no area is so designated, at the door of the county courthouse of said county, at a time between the hours of 10:00 A.M. and 4:00 P.M. that is no later than three (3) hours after the time stated in the notice described immediately below as the earliest time at which such sale would occur on the first Tuesday of any month, after advertising the earliest time at which said sale would occur, the place and terms of said sale, and the portion of the Mortgaged Property to be sold, by (a) posting (or by having some person or persons acting for the Trustee post) for at least twenty-one (21) days preceding the date of the sale, written or printed notice of the proposed sale at the courthouse door of said county in which the sale is to be made; and if such portion of the Mortgaged Property lies in more than one county, one such notice of sale shall be posted at the courthouse door of each county in which such part of the Mortgaged Property is situated and such part of the Mortgaged Property may be sold in the area at the county courthouse of any one of such counties designated by such county’s commissioner’s court for such proceedings, or if no area is so designated, at the courthouse door of such county, and the notice so posted shall designate in which county such property shall be sold, and (b) filing in the office of the county clerk of each county in which any part of the Mortgaged Property that is to be sold at such sale is situated a copy of the notice posted in accordance with the preceding clause (a).  In addition to such posting and filing of notice, the Trustee shall, at least twenty-one (21) days preceding the date of sale, serve, or cause to be served written notice of the proposed sale by certified mail on the Mortgagor and on each other debtor, if any, obligated to pay the Secured Obligations according to the records of the Secured Party or other holder of the Secured Obligations.  Service of such notice shall be completed upon deposit of the notice, enclosed in a postpaid wrapper properly addressed to the Mortgagor and such other debtors at their most recent address or addresses as shown by the records of the Secured Party or other holder of the Secured Obligations in a post office or official depository under the care and custody of the United States Postal Service.  The affidavit of any person having knowledge of the facts to the effect that such a service was completed shall be prima facie evidence of the fact of service.  The Mortgagor agrees that no notice of any sale of the Mortgaged Property other than as set out in this paragraph, need be given by the Trustee or any other Person.  The Mortgagor hereby designates as its address for the purpose of such notice the address set out on the signature page hereof, and agrees that such address may be changed only in the manner set forth in Section 12(b) of the Letter Loan Agreement.  The Mortgagor authorizes and empowers the Trustee to sell the Mortgaged Property in lots or parcels or in its entirety as the Trustee shall deem expedient; and to execute and deliver to the purchaser or purchasers thereof deeds conveying the property, but without any covenant or warranty, express or implied. Where portions of the Mortgaged Property lie in different counties, sales in such counties may be conducted in any order that the Trustee may deem expedient; and one or more such sales may be conducted in the same month, or in successive or different months as the Trustee may deem expedient.  The Trustee may postpone the sale provided for in this Section 5.1 by public announcement at the time and place of such sale, and from time to time thereafter may further postpone such sale by public announcement made at the time of sale fixed by the preceding postponement.  The provisions hereof with respect to the posting and giving of notices of sale are intended to comply with the provisions of §51.002 of the Texas Property Code, effective January 1, 1984, and in the event the requirements, or any notice, under such §51.002 of the Texas Property Code shall be eliminated or the prescribed manner of giving such notices modified by future amendment to, or adoption of any statute superseding, §51.002 of the Texas Property Code, the requirement for such particular notices shall be deemed stricken from or modified in this instrument in conformity with such amendment or superseding statute, effective as of the effective date thereof.




A POWER OF SALE HAS BEEN GRANTED IN THIS MORTGAGE.  A POWER OF SALE MAY ALLOW THE TRUSTEE OR SECURED PARTY TO TAKE THE MORTGAGED PROPERTY AND SELL IT WITHOUT GOING TO COURT IN A FORECLOSURE ACTION UPON DEFAULT BY THE MORTGAGOR UNDER THIS MORTGAGE.

C.                      During the continuation of an Event of Default, the Secured Party will have all rights and remedies granted by law, and particularly by the Uniform Commercial Code or similar statute in force in any other state to the extent the same is applicable law, including, but not limited to, the right to take possession of all personal property constituting a part of the Mortgaged Property and for this purpose the Secured Party may enter upon any premises on which any or all of such personal property is situated and take possession of and operate such personal property (or any portion thereof) or remove it therefrom.  The Secured Party may require the Mortgagor to assemble such personal property to the extent feasible and make it available to the Secured Party at a place to be designated by the Secured Party that is reasonably convenient to all parties.  Unless such personal property is perishable or threatens to decline speedily in value or is of a type customarily sold on a recognized market, the Secured Party will give the Mortgagor reasonable notice of the time and place of any public sale or of the time after which any private sale or other disposition of such personal property is to be made.  This requirement of sending reasonable notice will be met if the notice is mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the Mortgagor at the address shown below the signatures at the end of this instrument (or at such other address for notice hereafter designated by the Mortgagor in conformity with Section 11(b) of the Letter Loan Agreement) at least ten (10) days before the time of the sale or disposition.




D.                      In the event of a foreclosure sale, whether made by the Trustee or the Secured Party under the terms hereof, or under judgment of a court, the personal property constituting a portion of the Mortgaged Property and the other Mortgaged Property may, at the option of Secured Party, be sold as a whole.  It shall not be necessary that the Secured Party take possession of such personal property or any part thereof prior to the time that any sale pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5.2 is conducted and it shall not be necessary that such personal property or any part thereof be present at the location of such sale.  With respect to the application of proceeds of disposition of such personal property under Section 5.9 of this Mortgage, the costs and expenses incident to disposition shall include the reasonable expenses of retaking, holding, preparing for sale or lease, selling, leasing, and the like and the reasonable attorneys’ fees and legal expenses incurred by the Trustee or the Secured Party, as applicable.  Any and all statements of fact or other recitals made in any bill of sale or assignment or other instrument evidencing any foreclosure sale hereunder as to nonpayment of the Secured Obligations or as to the occurrence of any default, or as to Secured Party having declared all of such Secured Obligations to be due and payable, or as to notice of time, place, and terms of sale and of the properties to be sold having been duly given, or as to any other act or thing having been duly done by the Trustee or the Secured Party, shall be taken as prima facie evidence of the truth of the facts so stated and recited; and Secured Party may appoint or delegate any one or more persons as agent to perform any act or acts necessary or incident to any sale held by Secured Party, including the sending of notices and the conduct of the sale, but in the name and on behalf of Secured Party.




5.3           Rights of the Trustee and the Secured Party with Respect to Fixtures Constituting a Part of the Mortgaged Property.  During the continuation of an Event of Default, the Trustee or the Secured Party, as applicable, may elect to treat the fixtures constituting a part of the Mortgaged Property as either real property collateral or personal property collateral and then proceed to exercise such rights as apply to such type of collateral.




5.4           Judicial Proceedings.  The Trustee, in lieu of or in addition to exercising any power of sale herein given, may proceed by a suit or suits in equity or at law, whether for a foreclosure hereunder, or for the sale of the Mortgaged Property, or for the specific performance of any covenant or agreement herein contained or in aid of the execution of any power herein granted, or for the appointment of a receiver pending any foreclosure hereunder or the sale of the Mortgaged Property, or for the enforcement of any other appropriate legal or equitable remedy.  The Mortgagor hereby acknowledges the Secured Obligations, whether now existing or that arise hereafter, and, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law, confesses judgment thereon in the full amount of the Secured Obligations in favor of the Secured Party if the obligations are not paid pursuant to the terms of the Note or the Letter Loan Agreement.




5.5           Possession of the Mortgaged Property.  It shall not be necessary for the Trustee or the Secured Party to have physically present or constructively in their possession at any sale held by the Trustee, the Secured Party, or by any court, receiver, or public officer any of the Mortgaged Property; and the Mortgagor shall deliver to the purchasers at such sale on the date of sale the Mortgaged Property purchased by such purchasers at such sale, and if it should be impossible or impracticable for any of such purchasers to take actual delivery of the Mortgaged Property, then the title and right of possession to the Mortgaged Property shall pass to such purchaser at such sale as completely as if the same had been actually present and delivered.

5.6           Certain Aspects of a Sale.  The Secured Party shall have the right to become the purchaser at any sale made pursuant to this Article V.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, recitals contained in any conveyance made to any purchaser at any sale made hereunder shall conclusively establish the truth and accuracy of the matters therein stated, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, nonpayment of the Secured Obligations, after the same have become due and payable, advertisement and conduct of such sale in the manner provided herein or appointment of any successor Trustee hereunder.




5.7           Receipt to Purchaser.  Upon any sale, whether made under the power of sale herein granted and conferred or by virtue of judicial proceedings, the receipt of the Trustee, or the Secured Party, or of the officer making sale under judicial proceedings, shall be sufficient discharge to the purchaser or purchasers at any sale for his or her or their purchase money, and such purchaser or purchasers, or his or her or their assigns or personal representatives, shall not, after paying such purchase money and receiving such receipt of the Trustee or the Secured Party or of such officer therefor, be obliged to see to the application of such purchase money, or be in anywise answerable for any loss, misapplication or nonapplication thereof.




5.8           Effect of Sale.  Any sale or sales of the Mortgaged Property, whether under the power of sale herein granted and conferred or by virtue of judicial proceedings, shall operate to divest all right, title, interest, claim, and demand whatsoever either at law or in equity, of the Mortgagor of, in and to the premises and the property sold, and shall be a perpetual bar, both at law and in equity, against the Mortgagor, and the Mortgagor’s successors or assigns, and against any and all persons claiming or who shall thereafter claim all or any of the property sold from, through, or under the Mortgagor or the Mortgagor’s successors or assigns.  Nevertheless, the Mortgagor, if requested by the Secured Party or the Trustee to do so, shall join in the execution and delivery of all proper conveyances, assignments, and transfers of the properties so sold.




5.9           Application of Proceeds.  The proceeds of any sale of the Mortgaged Property, or any part thereof, whether under the power of sale herein granted and conferred or by virtue of judicial proceedings, shall be applied in the manner determined by Secured Party in her sole discretion, to the extent permitted by applicable law, provided that any proceeds remaining in excess of the total amount of all the expenses incurred associated with the sale (including but not limited to protecting and enforcing rights under this Mortgage) and fully satisfying all of the outstanding Secured Obligations are returned to the Mortgagor.




5.10           Mortgagor’s Waiver of Appraisement, Marshaling, and Other Rights.  The Mortgagor agrees, to the full extent that the Mortgagor may lawfully so agree, that the Mortgagor will not at any time insist upon or plead or in any manner whatever claim the benefit of any appraisement, valuation, stay, extension, or redemption law now or hereafter in force, in order to prevent or hinder the enforcement or foreclosure of this instrument or the absolute sale of the Mortgaged Property or the possession thereof by any purchaser at any sale made pursuant to any provision hereof, or pursuant to the decree of any court of competent jurisdiction; the Mortgagor, for the Mortgagor and all who may claim through or under the Mortgagor, so far as the Mortgagor or those claiming through or under the Mortgagor now or hereafter lawfully may, hereby waives the benefit of all such laws.  The Mortgagor, for the Mortgagor and all who may claim through or under the Mortgagor, waives, to the extent that the Mortgagor may lawfully do so, any and all right to have the Mortgaged Property marshaled upon any foreclosure of the lien hereof, or sold in inverse order of alienation, and agrees that the Trustee, the Secured Party, or any court having jurisdiction to foreclose such lien may sell the Mortgaged Property as an entirety.  The Mortgagor, for the Mortgagor and all who may claim through or under the Mortgagor, further waives, to the full extent that the Mortgagor may lawfully do so, any requirement for posting a receiver’s bond or replevin bond or other similar type of bond if the Trustee or the Secured Party commence an action for appointment of a receiver or an action for replevin to recover possession of any of the Mortgaged Property.  If any law in this paragraph referred to and now in force, of which the Mortgagor or the Mortgagor’s successor or successors might take advantage despite the provisions hereof, shall hereafter be repealed or cease to be in force, such law shall not thereafter be deemed to constitute any part of the contract herein contained or to preclude the operation or application of the provisions of this paragraph.

5.11           Costs and Expenses.  All costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by the Trustee or the Secured Party in protecting and enforcing their rights hereunder shall constitute a demand obligation owing by the Mortgagor to the party incurring such costs and expenses and shall draw interest at an annual rate equal to the rate of interest from time to time accruing on the Note under the Letter Loan Agreement until paid, all of which shall constitute a portion of the Secured Obligations.




5.12           Operation of the Mortgaged Property by the Trustee or the Secured Party.  Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and in addition to all other rights herein conferred on the Trustee or the Secured Party, the Trustee or the Secured Party (or any person, firm, or corporation designated by the Trustee or the Secured Party) shall have the right and power, but shall not be obligated, to enter upon and take possession of any of the Mortgaged Property, and to exclude the Mortgagor, and the Mortgagor’s agents or servants, wholly therefrom, and to hold, use, administer, manage, and operate the same to the extent that the Mortgagor shall be at the time entitled and in its place and stead.  The Trustee or the Secured Party, or any person, firm, or corporation designated by the Trustee or by the Secured Party, may operate the same without any liability to the Mortgagor in connection with such operations, except to use ordinary care in the operation of such properties, and the Trustee or the Secured Party or any person, firm, or corporation designated by the Trustee or the Secured Party, shall have the right to collect, receive, and receipt for all Hydrocarbons produced and sold from said properties, to make repairs, purchase machinery and equipment, conduct work-over operations, drill additional wells, and to exercise every power, right, and privilege of the Mortgagor with respect to the Mortgaged Property necessary or advisable (in the reasonable determination of the Secured Party) to preserve and protect the Mortgage Property.  When and if the Event of Default is not longer continuing said properties shall, if there has been no sale or foreclosure, be returned to the Mortgagor.




5.13           Other Jurisdictions.  In the event the Mortgaged Property, or any part thereof, shall be located in any state other than the State of Texas, the procedures for foreclosure and all other provisions of this Article V relating to remedies upon default and related matters shall be modified to the extent necessary to comply with the laws of the state in which such properties are located.  It is the intent of the Mortgagor that this Mortgage shall be legal and enforceable in any state in which the Mortgaged Property, or any part thereof, is located and that the provisions hereof shall be modified only to the extent necessary to comply with the laws of such state, and that all other provisions contained herein shall be in no way affected or impaired by the necessity to so modify some or all of the provisions of this Article V.

6.5           Other Security.  The Trustee and the Secured Party may take or may now hold other security for the Secured Obligations, including other security from Persons other than Mortgagor, all without notice to or consent of the Mortgagor.  The Trustee or the Secured Party may resort first to such other security or any part thereof or first to the security herein given or any part thereof, or from time to time to either or both, even to the partial or complete abandonment of either security, and such action shall not be a waiver of any rights conferred by this instrument, which shall continue as a first Lien upon and prior perfected security interest, subject to Liens permitted by Section 8(e) of the Letter Loan Agreement, in the Mortgaged Property not expressly released until the Secured Obligations are fully paid.




6.6           Instrument as Assignment, etc.  This instrument shall be deemed to be and may be enforced from time to time as an assignment, chattel mortgage, contract, deed of trust, financing statement, real estate mortgage, or security agreement, and from time to time as any one or more thereof.

6.8           Rights Cumulative.  Each and every right, power, and remedy herein given to the Trustee or the Secured Party under this Mortgage shall be cumulative and not exclusive; and each and every right, power, and remedy whether specifically herein given or otherwise existing may be exercised from time to time and so often and in such order as may be deemed expedient by the Trustee or the Secured Party, as the case may be, and the exercise, or the beginning of the exercise, of any such right, power, or remedy shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to exercise, at the same time or thereafter, any other right, power, or remedy.  No delay or omission by the Trustee or the Secured Party in the exercise of any right, power, or remedy shall impair any such right, power, or remedy or operate as a waiver thereof or of any other right, power, or remedy then or thereafter existing.
