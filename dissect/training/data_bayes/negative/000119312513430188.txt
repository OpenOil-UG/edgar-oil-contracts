 2.2 Amendment to Section 9.19. Section 9.19 is hereby amended and restated in
its entirety to read as follows:  Section 9.19. Swap Agreements. The Borrower will not, and will not permit any Restricted
Subsidiary to, enter into any Swap Agreements with any Person other than:  (a) Swap Agreements in respect of commodities
(i) with an Approved Counterparty and (ii) the notional volumes for which (when aggregated with other commodity Swap Agreements then in effect other than basis differential swaps on volumes already hedged pursuant to other Swap Agreements)
do not exceed, as of the date such Swap Agreement is executed (A) 85% of the Projected Production for each month during the period during which such Swap Agreement is in effect for each of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas,
calculated individually, for the period of 24 months following the date such Swap Agreement is executed; (B) 75% of the Current Production for each month during the period during which such Swap Agreement is in effect for each of crude oil,
natural gas liquids and natural gas, calculated individually, for the period of 25 to 36 months following the date such Swap Agreement is executed; and (C) 50% of the Current Production for each month during the period during which such Swap
Agreement is in effect for each of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas, calculated individually, for the period of 37 to 48 months following the date such Swap Agreement is executed, provided, however, that for purposes of this
Section 9.19(a), put options and price floors for crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas shall be disregarded; 
(b) In addition to Swap Agreements under Section 9.19(a) and without further limitation, in connection with a proposed
acquisition of Oil and Gas Properties for which the Borrower or a Restricted Subsidiary has signed a definitive acquisition agreement (a Proposed Acquisition), the Borrower may also enter into incremental Swap Agreements with an
Approved Counterparty with respect to the reasonably anticipated projected production from the Oil and Gas Properties subject of the Proposed Acquisition so long as the aggregate notional volumes for such incremental Swap Agreements do not exceed
the lesser of (A)(I) 85% of the Projected Production associated with the Oil and Gas Properties subject of such Proposed Acquisition for each month during the period during which each such Swap Agreement is in effect, for each of crude oil, natural
gas liquids and natural gas, calculated individually, for the period of 24 months following the date such incremental Swap Agreement is executed, (II) 75% of the Projected Production associated with the Oil and Gas

   2 





 
Properties subject of such Proposed Acquisition for each month during the period during which each such Swap Agreement is in effect, for each of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas,
calculated individually, for the period of 25 to 36 months following the date such incremental Swap Agreement is executed and (III) 50% of the Projected Production associated with the Oil and Gas Properties subject of such Proposed Acquisition for
each month during the period during which each such Swap Agreement is in effect, for each of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas, calculated individually, for the period of 37 to 48 months following the date such incremental Swap
Agreement is executed or (B) when aggregated with notional volumes of the Borrowers and its Restricted Subsidiaries existing Swap Agreements for each such period, exceed 150% of volume limitations imposed under Section 9.19(a)
above, for a period not exceeding 48 months from the date such incremental Swap Agreement is executed. Such incremental Swap Agreements shall be terminated by the Borrower upon the occurrence of any of the following: (1) the third
(3rd) Business Day after such Proposed Acquisition is terminated or (2) if the Proposed Acquisition shall not have been consummated prior thereto, (x) undrawn availability becoming less than 10% of the then effective Borrowing Base or
(y) the 60th day after a definitive acquisition agreement for such Proposed Acquisition was executed; provided, for the avoidance of doubt, that any incremental Swap Agreements entered into in compliance with this Section 9.19(b) shall be
permitted to remain in place after consummation of the applicable Proposed Acquisition notwithstanding the provisions of Section 9.19(a). If such incremental Swap Agreements are not permitted to remain in place pursuant to the preceding
sentence, the Borrower shall promptly terminate or unwind such Swap Agreements; provided that the termination or unwinding of such incremental Swap Agreements shall not cause (i) notice to be given by the Borrower to the Lenders in accordance
with Section 8.18 or (ii) a Borrowing Base redetermination pursuant to Section 2.07(f); and  (c) Swap
Agreements in respect of interest rates with an Approved Counterparty, as follows: (i) Swap Agreements effectively converting interest rates from fixed to floating, the notional amounts of which (when aggregated with all other Swap Agreements
of the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries then in effect effectively converting interest rates from fixed to floating) do not exceed 50% of the then outstanding principal amount of the Borrowers Debt for borrowed money which bears
interest at a fixed rate (after netting out any Swap Agreements then in effect effectively converting interest rates from floating to fixed) and (ii) Swap Agreements effectively converting interest rates from

   3 





 
floating to fixed, the notional amounts of which (when aggregated with all other Swap Agreements of the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries then in effect effectively converting interest
rates from floating to fixed) do not exceed 75% of the then outstanding principal amount of the Borrowers Debt for borrowed money which bears interest at a floating rate (after netting out any Swap Agreements then in effect effectively
converting interest rates from floating to fixed).  In no event shall any Swap Agreement contain any current requirement,
agreement or covenant for the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary to post collateral or margin, other than letters of credit permitted by this Agreement (in an amount not to exceed $10,000,000 in the aggregate), to secure their obligations under
such Swap Agreement or to cover market exposures.  2.3 Amendment to Section 12.01(a). Section 12.01(a) is hereby
amended to delete subsections (i) through (iii) and replace such subsections with the following:  (i) if to
the Borrower, to it at: 1111 Bagby Street, Suite 1600, Houston, TX 77002, Attention: General Counsel (Telephone: 713.335.4000; Facsimile: 713.481.8561); 
(ii) if to the Administrative Agent, to it at Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, 1525 West W.T. Harris Boulevard, MAC
D1109-019, Charlotte, NC 28262, Attention: Yvette McQueen (Telephone: 704.590.2706, Facsimile: 704.590.2782); with a copy to: Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, 1000 Louisiana Street, Ninth Floor, Houston, Texas 77002, MAC T0002-090, Attention:
Lila Jordan, Managing Director (Telephone: 713.319.1880; Facsimile: 713.319.1925);  (iii) if to the Issuing Bank, to it at
Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, 1525 West W.T. Harris Boulevard, MAC D1109-019, Charlotte, NC 28262, Attention: Yvette McQueen (Telephone: 704.590.2706, Facsimile: 704.590.2782); with a copy to: Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, 1000
Louisiana Street, Ninth Floor, Houston, Texas 77002, MAC T0002-090, Attention: Lila Jordan, Managing Director (Telephone: 713.319.1880; Facsimile: 713.319.1925); and 
Section 3. Waiver. The Borrower has informed the Administrative Agent that it has recently consummated the acquisition of certain
Oil and Gas Properties in the Delaware Basin in Gaines and Reeves Counties, Texas from Comstock Resources, Inc. (the Acquisition) on May 14, 2013, and on May 29, 2013, subsequent to such consummation, the Borrower
entered into certain Swap Agreements (the Specified Swaps) related to such Acquisition based upon the language in Section 9.19(a) dealing with incremental Swap Agreements related to Proposed Acquisitions rather than in
accordance with the provisions of Section 9.19(a) dealing with ordinary course Swap Agreements. As a consequence the Borrower is currently hedged in excess of the limit set forth in Section 9.19(a) for ordinary course Swap Agreements. The
Borrower has requested, and the Majority Lenders hereby consent to a waiver with regard to Section 9.19(a) and agree to allow the Borrower to maintain the Specified Swaps.

affirm: (a) that as of the date of execution and delivery of this Seventh Amendment, all of the representations and warranties contained in each Loan Document to which the Borrower and Guarantors are a party are true and correct in all material
respects as though made on and as of the Seventh Amendment Effective Date (unless made as of a specific earlier date, in which case, was true as of such date); and (b) that, after giving effect to this Seventh Amendment and to the transactions
contemplated hereby, no Defaults or Events of Default exist under the Loan Documents or will exist under the Loan Documents.

other Loan Documents, or any other contract or instrument, or (iii) constitute any course of dealing or other basis for altering any obligation of the Borrower or any right, privilege or remedy of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders under
the Credit Agreement, the other Loan Documents, or any other contract or instrument. Nothing in this Seventh Amendment shall be construed to be a consent by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders to any Other Violations.
