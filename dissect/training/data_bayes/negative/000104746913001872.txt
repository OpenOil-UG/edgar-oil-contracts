Each subsidiary of GeoResources other than those subsidiaries which would not, individually or in the aggregate, constitute a significant subsidiary as defined in Item 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X (each such significant subsidiary, a GeoResources Subsidiary) is a corporation, partnership, limited liability company or business trust duly incorporated or organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, with the requisite entity power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties, except where the failure to be duly incorporated or organized, validly existing or to be in good standing would not result in a Pro Forma Material Adverse Effect.  GeoResources and its subsidiaries conduct their business as described in the Preliminary Offering Memorandum and the Pricing Disclosure Package and each GeoResources Subsidiary is duly qualified as a foreign corporation, partnership, limited liability company, business trust or other organization to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is required, whether by reason of the ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of business, except where the failure to qualify or to be in good standing would not result in a Pro Forma Material Adverse Effect.

(a)           The Company and each Guarantor (in the case of the Acquired Guarantors, upon execution and delivery of the Joinder Agreement), hereby agrees, jointly and severally, to indemnify and hold harmless each Initial Purchaser, its affiliates, directors, officers and employees and each person, if any, who controls any Initial Purchaser within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability, joint or several, or any action in respect thereof (including, but not limited to, any loss, claim, damage, liability or action relating to purchases and sales of Notes), to which that Initial Purchaser, affiliate, director, officer, employee or controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained (A) in any Free Writing Offering Document, the Preliminary Offering Memorandum, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Offering Memorandum or in any amendment or supplement thereto, (B) in any Blue Sky application or other document prepared or executed by the Company or any Guarantor (or based upon any
 
35






 
written information furnished by the Company or any Guarantor) specifically for the purpose of qualifying any or all of the Notes under the securities laws of any state or other jurisdiction (any such application, document or information being hereinafter called a Blue Sky Application), or (C) in any materials or information provided to investors by, or with the approval of, the Company or any Guarantor in connection with the marketing of the offering of the Notes (Marketing Materials), including any road show or investor presentations made to investors by the Company (whether in person or electronically) or any materials prepared for the purpose of compliance with the Canadian securities laws, or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in any Free Writing Offering Document, the Preliminary Offering Memorandum, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Offering Memorandum, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or in any Blue Sky Application or in any Marketing Materials, any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and shall reimburse each Initial Purchaser and each such affiliate, director, officer, employee or controlling person promptly upon demand for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by that Initial Purchaser, affiliate, director, officer, employee or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company and the Guarantors shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Offering Memorandum, the Pricing Disclosure Package or Offering Memorandum, or in any such amendment or supplement thereto, or in any Blue Sky Application or in any Marketing Materials, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information concerning such Initial Purchaser furnished to the Company through the Representatives by or on behalf of any Initial Purchaser specifically for inclusion therein, which information consists solely of the information specified in Section 8(e).  The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability that the Company or the Guarantors may otherwise have to any Initial Purchaser or to any affiliate, director, officer, employee or controlling person of that Initial Purchaser.
 
(b)           Each Initial Purchaser, severally and not jointly, hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each Guarantor (in the case of the Acquired Guarantors, only upon execution and delivery of the Joinder Agreement), their respective officers and employees, each of their respective directors, and each person, if any, who controls the Company or any Guarantor within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability, joint or several, or any action in respect thereof, to which the Company, any Guarantor or any such director, officer, employee or controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained (A) in any Free Writing Offering Document, Preliminary Offering Memorandum, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Offering Memorandum or in any amendment or supplement thereto, (B) in any Blue Sky Application, or (C) in any Marketing Materials, or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in any Free Writing Offering Document, Preliminary Offering Memorandum, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Offering Memorandum, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or in any Blue Sky Application or in any Marketing Materials any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, but in each case only to the extent that the untrue statement or alleged
 
36






 
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information concerning such Initial Purchaser furnished to the Company through the Representatives by or on behalf of that Initial Purchaser specifically for inclusion therein, which information is limited to the information set forth in Section 8(e).  The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability that any Initial Purchaser may otherwise have to the Company, any Guarantor or any such director, officer, employee or controlling person.
 
(c)           Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, the indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the claim or the commencement of that action; provided, however, that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under this Section 8 except to the extent it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure and; provided, further, that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under this paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8.  If any such claim or action shall be brought against an indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party.  After notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party under this Section 8 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided, however, that the Initial Purchasers shall have the right to employ counsel to represent jointly the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates, directors, officers, employees and controlling persons who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by the Initial Purchasers against the Company or any Guarantor under this Section 8, if (i) the Company, the Guarantors and the Initial Purchasers shall have so mutually agreed; (ii) the Company and the Guarantors have failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Initial Purchasers; (iii) the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates, directors, officers, employees and controlling persons shall have reasonably concluded, based on the advice of counsel, that there may be legal defenses available to them that are different from or in addition to those available to the Company and the Guarantors; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates, directors, officers, employees or controlling persons, on the one hand, and the Company and the Guarantors, on the other hand, and representation of both sets of parties by the same counsel would present a conflict due to actual or potential differing interests between them, and in any such event the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the Company and the Guarantors.  No indemnifying party shall (x) without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and does not include a statement as to, or an admission
 
37






 
of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party, or (y) be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with the consent of the indemnifying party or if there be a final judgment of the plaintiff in any such action, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.
 
(d)           If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 shall for any reason be unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) in respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability, or any action in respect thereof, referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, (i) in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other, from the offering of the Notes, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other, with respect to the statements or omissions that resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other, with respect to such offering shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Notes purchased under this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the total discounts and commissions received by the Initial Purchasers with respect to the Notes purchased under this Agreement, on the other hand, bear to the total gross proceeds from the offering of the Notes under this Agreement as set forth on the cover page of the Offering Memorandum.  The relative fault shall be determined by reference to whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, the Guarantors, or the Initial Purchasers, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  For purposes of the preceding two sentences, the net proceeds deemed to be received by the Company shall be deemed to be also for the benefit of the Guarantors, and information supplied by the Company shall also be deemed to have been supplied by the Guarantors.  The Company, the Guarantors, and the Initial Purchasers agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 8(d) were to be determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Initial Purchasers were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to herein.  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, referred to above in this Section 8(d) shall be deemed to include, for purposes of this Section 8(d), any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8(d), no Initial Purchaser shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the net proceeds from the sale to Eligible Purchasers of the Notes initially purchased by it exceeds the amount of any damages that such Initial Purchaser has otherwise paid or become liable to pay by reason of any untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person
 
38






 
guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The Initial Purchasers obligations to contribute as provided in this Section 8(d) are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations and not joint.
 
(e)           The Initial Purchasers severally confirm and the Company and the Guarantors acknowledge and agree that the statements contained in the second sentence under the heading Plan of DistributionRule 144A and Regulation S in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Offering Memorandum are correct and constitute the only information concerning such Initial Purchasers furnished in writing to the Company or any Guarantor by or on behalf of the Initial Purchasers specifically for inclusion in any Free Writing Offering Document, the Preliminary Offering Memorandum, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Offering Memorandum, or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any Blue Sky Application or in any Marketing Materials.
 
9.             Defaulting Initial Purchasers.
 
(a)           If, on the Closing Date, any Initial Purchaser defaults in its obligations to purchase the Notes that it has agreed to purchase under this Agreement, the remaining non-defaulting Initial Purchasers may in their discretion arrange for the purchase of such Notes by the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers or other persons satisfactory to the Company on the terms contained in this Agreement.  If, within 36 hours after any such default by any Initial Purchaser, the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers do not arrange for the purchase of such Notes, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure other persons satisfactory to the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers to purchase such Notes on such terms.  In the event that within the respective prescribed periods, the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Notes, or the Company notifies the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Notes, either the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers or the Company may postpone the Closing Date for up to seven full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Initial Purchasers may be necessary in the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Offering Memorandum or in any other document or arrangement, and the Company agrees to promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Offering Memorandum that effects any such changes.  As used in this Agreement, the term Initial Purchaser includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context requires otherwise, any party not listed in Schedule I hereto that, pursuant to this Section 9, purchases Notes that a defaulting Initial Purchaser agreed but failed to purchase.
 
(b)           If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Notes of a defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers by the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Notes that remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Notes, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Initial Purchaser to purchase the principal amount of Notes that such Initial Purchaser agreed to purchase hereunder plus such Initial Purchasers pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Notes that such Initial Purchaser agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Notes of such defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers for which such arrangements have not been made; provided that
 
39






 
the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers shall not be obligated to purchase more than 110% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes that it agreed to purchase on the Closing Date pursuant to the terms of Section 3.
 
(c)           If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Notes of a defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers by the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Notes that remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Notes, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in paragraph (b) above, then this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers.  Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9 shall be without liability on the part of the Company or the Guarantors, except that the Company and each of the Guarantors will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses as set forth in Sections 6 and 11 to the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers and except that the provisions of Section 8 shall not terminate and shall remain in effect.
 
(d)           Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Initial Purchaser of any liability it may have to the Company, the Guarantors or any non-defaulting Initial Purchaser for damages caused by its default.
 
10.          Termination.  The obligations of the Initial Purchasers hereunder may be terminated by the Initial Purchasers by notice given to and received by the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Notes if, prior to that time, any of the events described in Sections 7(h), (i), (l) or (q) shall have occurred or if the Initial Purchasers shall decline to purchase the Notes for any reason permitted under this Agreement.
 
11.          Reimbursement of Initial Purchasers Expenses.  If (a) the Company for any reason fails to tender the Notes for delivery to the Initial Purchasers, or (b) the Initial Purchasers shall decline to purchase the Notes for any reason permitted under this Agreement, the Company and the Guarantors shall jointly and severally reimburse the Initial Purchasers for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel for the Initial Purchasers) incurred by the Initial Purchasers in connection with this Agreement and the proposed purchase of the Notes, and upon demand the Company and the Guarantors shall pay the full amount thereof to the Initial Purchasers.  If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9 by reason of the default of one or more Initial Purchasers, the Company and the Guarantors shall not be obligated to reimburse any defaulting Initial Purchaser on account of those expenses.
 
12.          Notices, etc.  All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and:

Settlement Date    

     

July 16, 2012 (T+10) 
 
We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment   therefor on or about the 10th business day following the   date of confirmation of orders with respect to the Notes (this settlement   cycle being referred to as T+10). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Commission   under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required   to settle in three business days, unless the parties to any such trade   expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the   Notes on the trade date or the following six trading days will be required,   by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will settle in T+10, to   specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to   prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade the   Notes before their delivery should
