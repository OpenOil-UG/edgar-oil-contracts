“Paradise Unit Leases”).

 

C. There are
additional leases included in the Prospect that are not part of the Paradise Unit. The Prospect leases or portions of Prospect
leases not included in the Paradise Unit are identified and described on Exhibit C attached hereto the “Non-Unit Leases”
and, collectively with the Paradise Unit Leases, the “Prospect Leases”).

 

D. Subject to
the provisions of the Paradise Unit Agreement, operations for the Paradise Unit have been and shall be conducted pursuant to the
Unit Operating Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit D (the “Paradise Unit Operating Agreement”).

 

E. Pursuant to
that certain Farmout Agreement dated June 11, 2010 attached hereto as Exhibit E (the “Farmout Agreement”), by
and between Empire and Cortez Exploration, L.L.C. and Windmill Oil & Gas, L.L.C. (the “Cortez Group”), Empire drilled
that certain initial test well with respect to the Paradise Unit Leases located on Lease No. N-599901, in the SE/4 of the SE/4
of the NE/4 of Section 12-T12N-R34E (the “Empire Paradise Unit No. 2-12 Well”) to a depth of approximately 4,248 feet.

 

F. Empire owns
98% (of 8/8ths) leasehold interest, record title interest and working interest in all of the Prospect Leases and 98% of 80% (of
8/8ths) net revenue interest in each of the Prospect Leases, all subject to certain reversionary interests to the Cortez Group
pursuant to the Farmout Agreement.

 

G. In exchange
for the payment of $[100,000] by Assignee to Empire, the Parties have agreed that the Empire will assign to Assignee [1]% of Empire’s
gross working interest (which is [1]% of 80% (of 8/8ths) net revenue interest) in the Paradise Unit Leases and the Empire Paradise
Unit No. 2-12 Well and grant Assignee an option to participate in the Non-Unit Leases.

 

Agreement

 

In consideration
of the mutual premises and covenants contained herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereby agree as follows:

 

1. Purchase
Price; Assignment of Transferred Interest. In exchange for the payment of $[100,000] by Assignee to Empire (the “Purchase
Price”), Empire shall assign to Assignee [1]% of Empire’s gross working interest (which is [1]% of 80% (of 8/8ths)
net revenue interest) in the Paradise Unit Leases and the Empire Paradise Unit No. 2-12 Well (the “Paradise Unit Transferred
Interest”). Upon the execution of this Letter Agreement and the payment of the Purchase Price, Empire shall execute and deliver
to Assignee assignments of the Paradise Unit Transferred Interest in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Assignee.

 

2. Completion
of Empire Paradise Unit No. 2-12 Well. Empire hereby agrees that it will pay for the cost to deepen the Empire Paradise Unit
No. 2-12 Well another 800 to 1,000 feet. Assignee shall not have any responsibility to pay the costs to continue drilling the Empire
Paradise Unit No. 2-12 Well. Assignee likewise shall not have any responsibility to pay the costs to complete and equip the Empire
Paradise Unit No. 2-12 Well into pipeline connections or tanks, or to abandon the Empire Paradise Unit No. 2-12 Well should it
be a dry hole, as the case may be. As between Empire and Assignee, the manner in which to drill and complete the Empire Paradise
Unit No. 2-12 Well and the costs to be incurred to drill and complete the Empire Paradise Unit No. 2-12 Well shall be in the sole
discretion of Empire, consistent with good oil field practice. In this regard, Empire is not required to prepare an AFE or obtain
approval of an AFE from Assignee with respect to the drilling and completion (or abandonment) of the Empire Paradise Unit No. 2-12
Well.

 

3. Option
on Non-Unit Leases. The Parties acknowledge and agree that with respect to the Non-Unit Leases, Empire has certain optional
rights pursuant to Section VII of the Farmout Agreement and, in the event that Empire does not exercise such rights, Empire’s
interests in the Non-Unit Leases acquired from the Cortez Group pursuant to the Farmout Agreement are subject to a reversionary
interest to the Cortez Group (the “Cortez Group Reversionary Interest”). In the event that Empire elects to exercise
such optional rights with respect to any Non-Unit Lease, the Parties hereby agree that Assignee shall have the right to participate
along with Empire and receive [1]% gross working interest(which is [1]% of 80% (of 8/8ths) net revenue interest) in such Non-Unit
Lease (the “Non-Unit Lease Transferred Interest”) by paying [1]% of the rentals of such Non-Unit Lease, which Non-Unit
Lease Transferred Interest shall be subject to the Cortez Group Reversionary Interest. Empire shall be the operator with respect
to the drilling, completion and/or abandonment of the Non-Unit Test Well (as defined in the Farmout Agreement), if any, and all
operations of the Non-Unit Leases shall be conducted pursuant to the joint operating agreement attached hereto as Exhibit “D”.

 

4. Representations
and Warranties as to Title. Empire represents and warrants that as of the date of this Letter Agreement its title to the Prospect
Leases is free and clear from any prior conveyance, lien or encumbrance made or suffered by it, or by any person by, through or
under it, which diminishes, limits or burdens the rights and interests that Assignee has the right to earn under this Letter Agreement.
Empire further represents and warrants that until such time as the Non-Unit Leases, or any of them, are assigned to Assignee under
the terms of this Letter Agreement, Empire will not make or suffer, or allow to be made or suffered by any person by though or
under it, any conveyance, lien or encumbrance with respect to the Non-Unit Leases.

 

5. Burdens.
All assignments under this Letter Agreement shall be subject to and burdened by the terms and conditions of this Letter Agreement,
the Prospect Leases, the Paradise Unit Operating Agreement and the Paradise Unit Agreement (or, with respect to assignments of
the Non-Unit Leases, a unit agreement substantially similar to the Paradise Unit Agreement if a unit is subsequently formed), and
a proportionate part of all landowners’ royalties, overriding royalty interests and similar interests of record as of the
date of such assignment.

 

6. Tag Along
and Drag Along Rights.

 

(a)	Tag
Along. For a period of [five] years from and after the Effective Date, in the event either Party (the “Transferring Party”)
desires to sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or any portion of its interests in the Prospect, directly or indirectly,
the Transferring Party shall promptly deliver to the other Party (the “Non-Transferring Party”) written notice thereof,
and the Non-Transferring Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to elect to participate in the proposed transaction
in proportion to Non-Transferring Party’s interests in the Prospect as part of the proposed transaction at the same terms,
conditions and valuation. The notice shall include the name of the proposed transferee, and all of the terms and conditions of
the proposed transaction. The Non-Transferring Party shall deliver to the Transferring Party written notice of the Non-Transferring
Party’s election to participate in the proposed transaction on or before five days after the Non-Transferring Party’s
receipt of written of notice thereof from the Transferring Party. If the Non-Transferring Party fails to deliver its election within
said time-period, the Non-Transferring Party shall be deemed conclusively to have elected not to participate in the proposed transaction
hereunder. If the acquiring party in the proposed transaction is unwilling to acquire all of the interests offered, the Non-Transferring
Party shall have the right to participate in the proposed transaction in the same ratio as the Non-Transferring Party’s interest
in the Prospect bears to the total interests in the Prospect to be transferred by both the Transferring Party and the Non-Transferring
Party.

 

(b)	Drag
Along. If Empire receives a bona fide written offer (the “Purchase Offer”) from a third party (the “Purchaser”)
to purchase all or substantially all of Empire’s interest in the Prospect, and the Purchase Offer is acceptable in Empire’s
sole and absolute discretion, Empire shall have the right, but not the obligation, to cause Assignee (and their permitted assignee(s)
or successors, if any) to sell all (but not less than all) of Assignee’s interests in the Prospect in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Section 6(b) (the “Drag Along Right”). Empire shall elect to exercise the Drag Along Right
by written notice (the “Drag Along Notice”) delivered to Assignee on or before 30 days after receipt of the Purchase
Offer. The Drag Along Notice shall include the name of the Purchaser, the purchase price (the “Purchase Price”) and
all of the material terms and conditions of the proposed transaction. If Empire elects to exercise the Drag Along Right, the closing
of the transaction shall occur on or before 90 days after receipt of the Drag Along Notice under the circumstances described herein
and, upon compliance with the terms and conditions thereof, Assignee shall sell to such Purchaser all of their interest in the
Prospect. The closing of the Purchaser’s acquisition of Empire’s interest in the Prospect and Assignee’s interest
in the Prospect shall occur simultaneously and be conditioned upon each other.

    1
    (e) All legal subdivisions of lands (i.e., 40 acres by Government survey or its nearest lot or

    2
    tract equivalent; in instances of irregular surveys, unusually large lots or tracts shall be considered in

    3
    multiples of 40 acres or the nearest aliquot equivalent thereof), no parts of which are in or entitled to

    4
    be in a participating area on or before the fifth anniversary of the effective date of the first initial

    5
    participating area established under this unit agreement, shall be eliminated automatically from this

    6
    agreement, effective as of said fifth anniversary, and such lands shall no longer be a part of the unit

    7
    area and shall no longer be subject to this agreement, unless diligent drilling operations are in

    8
    progress on unitized lands not entitled to participation on said fifth anniversary, in which event all

    9
    such  lands  shall  remain  subject  hereto  for  so  long  as such  drilling  operations  are  continued

    10
    diligently, with not more than 90 days' time elapsing between the completion of one such well and

    11
    the commencement of the next such well.   All legal subdivisions of lands not entitled to be in a

    12
    participating area  within  10  years after  the  effective date of  the  first  initial  participating area

    13
    approved under this agreement shall be automatically eliminated from this agreement as of said

    14
    tenth  anniversary.    The  Unit  Operator  shall,  within  90  days  after  the  effective  date  of  any

    15
    elimination hereunder, describe the area so eliminated to the satisfaction of the AO and promptly

    16
    notify all parties in interest.   All lands reasonably proved productive of unitized substances in

    17
    paying quantities  by diligent  drilling  operations  after the aforesaid 5-year period  shall  become

    18
    participating in the same manner as during said first 5-year period.  However, when such diligent

    19
    drilling operations cease, all non-participating lands not then entitled to be in a participating area

    20
    shall be automatically eliminated effective as of the 91st day thereafter.

    21
     

    22
    Any expansion of the unit area pursuant to this section which embraces lands theretofore

    23
    eliminated pursuant  to  this  subsection  2(e)  shall  not be  considered  automatic  commitment or

    24
    recommitment of such lands.  If conditions warrant extension of the 10-year period specified in this

    25
    subsection, a single extension of not to exceed 2 years may be accomplished by consent of the

    26
    owners of 90% of the working interest in the current non-participating unitized lands and the owners

    27
    of 60% of the basic royalty interests (exclusive of the basic royalty interests of the United States) in

    28
    non-participating unitized lands with approval of the AO, provided such extension application is

    29
    submitted not later than 60 days prior to the expiration of said 10-year period.

    30
     

    31
     

    32
    3.   UNITIZED LAND  AND UNITIZED SUBSTANCES.     All land now or hereafter

    33
    committed to this agreement shall constitute land referred to herein as "unitized  land" or "land

    34
    subject to this agreement". All oil and gas in any and all formations of the unitized land are unitized

    35
    under the terms of this agreement and herein are called "unitized substances".

    36
     

    37
    4. UNIT OPERATOR. Cortez Exploration LLC is hereby designated as Unit Operator and

    38
    by signature hereto as Unit Operator agrees and consents to accept the duties and obligations of Unit

    39
    Operator for the discovery, development, and production of unitized substances as herein provided.

    40
    Whenever reference is made herein to the Unit Operator, such reference means the Unit Operator

    41
    acting in that capacity and not as an owner of interest in unitized substances, and the term "working

    42
    interest owner" when used herein shall include or refer to Unit Operator as the owner of a working

    43
     interest only when such an interest is owned by it.

    44
     

    45
    5. RESIGNATION OR REMOVAL OF UNIT OPERATOR. Unit Operator shall have

    46
    the right to resign at any time prior to the establishment of a participating area or areas hereunder,

     
    3

     
     

    1
    but such resignation shall not become effective so as to release Unit Operator from the duties and

    2
    obligations of Unit Operator and terminate Unit Operator's rights as such for a period of 6 months

    3
    after notice of intention to resign has been served by Unit Operator on all working interest owners

    4
    and the AO and until all wells then drilled hereunder are placed in a satisfactory condition for

    5
    suspension or abandonment, whichever is required by the AO, unless a new Unit Operator shall

    6
    have been selected and approved and shall have taken over and assumed the duties and obligations

    7
    of Unit Operator prior to the expiration of said period.

    8
     

    9
    Unit Operator shall have the right to resign in like manner and subject to like limitations as

    10
    above provided at any time after a participating area established hereunder is in existence, but in all

    11
    instances of resignation or removal, until a successor Unit Operator is selected and approved as

    12
    hereinafter provided, the working interest owners shall be jointly responsible for performance of the

    13
    duties of Unit Operator, and shall not later than 30 days before such resignation or removal becomes

    14
    effective appoint a common agent to represent them in any action to be taken hereunder.

    15
     

    16
    The resignation of Unit Operator shall not release Unit Operator from any liability for any

    17
    default by it hereunder occurring prior to the effective date of its resignation.

    18
     

    19
    The  Unit  Operator  may,  upon  default  or  failure  in  the  performance  of  its  duties  or

    20
    obligations hereunder, be subject to removal by the same percentage vote of the owners of working

    21
    interests as herein provided for the selection  of  a new Unit Operator.   Such  removal shall be

    22
    effective upon notice thereof to the AO.

    23
     

    24
    The resignation or removal of Unit Operator under this agreement shall not terminate its

    25
    right, title, or interest as the owner of a working interest or other interest in unitized substances, but

    26
    upon the resignation or removal of Unit Operator becoming effective, such Unit Operator shall

    27
    deliver possession of all wells, equipment, materials, and appurtenances used in conducting the unit

    28
    operations to the new duly qualified successor Unit Operator or to the common agent, if no such

    29
    new Unit Operator is selected, to be used for the purpose of conducting unit operations hereunder.

    30
    Nothing  herein  shall  be  construed  as  authorizing  removal  of  any  material,  equipment,  or

    31
    appurtenances needed for the preservation of any wells.

    32
     

    33
    6. SUCCESSOR UNIT OPERATOR. Whenever the Unit Operator shall tender his or its

    34
    resignation as Unit Operator or shall be removed as hereinabove provided, or a change of Unit

    35
    Operator is negotiated by the working interest owners, the owners of the working interests according

    36
    to their respective acreage interests in all unitized land shall, pursuant to the Approval of the Parties

    37
    requirements of the unit operating agreement, select a successor Unit Operator.  Such selection shall

    38
    not become effective until:

    39
     

    40
    (a)  a Unit Operator so selected shall accept in writing the duties and responsibilities of Unit

    41
    Operator, and

    42
     

    43
    (b)  the selection shall have been approved by the AO.

    44
     

    45
    If no successor Unit Operator is selected and qualified as herein provided, the AO at his

    46
    election may declare this unit agreement terminated.

    1
     

    2
    7. ACCOUNTING PROVISIONS AND UNIT OPERATING AGREEMENT. If the

    3
    Unit Operator is not  the sole owner of working interests, costs and  expenses incurred by Unit

    4
    Operator in conducting unit operations hereunder shall be paid and apportioned among and borne by

    5
    the owners of working interests, all in accordance with the agreement or agreements entered into by

    6
    and between the Unit Operator and the owners of working interests, whether one or more, separately

    7
    or collectively. Any agreement or agreements entered into between the working interest owners and

    8
    the Unit Operator as provided in this section, whether one or more, are herein referred to as the "unit

    9
    operating agreement".   Such unit operating agreement shall also provide the manner in which the

    10
    working interest owners  shall be entitled to receive their respective proportionate and allocated

    11
    share of the benefits accruing  hereto in conformity with their underlying operating agreements,

    12
    leases, or  other  independent  contracts,  and such  other  rights  and  obligations  as  between  Unit

    13
    Operator and the working interest owners as may be agreed upon by Unit Operator and the working

    14
    interest owners; however, no such unit operating agreement shall be deemed either to modify any of

    15
    the terms and conditions  of this unit agreement or to relieve the Unit Operator of any right or

    16
    obligation established  under  this  unit  agreement, and  in  case  of  any  inconsistency  or  conflict

    17
    between this agreement and the unit operating agreement, this agreement shall govern.  Two copies

    18
    of any unit operating agreement executed pursuant to this section shall be filed in the proper Bureau

    19
    of Land Management office, prior to approval of this unit agreement.

    20
     

    21
    8. RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF UNIT OPERATOR. Except as otherwise

    22
    specifically provided herein, the exclusive right, privilege, and duty of exercising any and all rights

    23
    of the parties hereto which  are necessary or convenient for prospecting for, producing, storing,

    24
    allocating, and distributing the unitized substances are hereby delegated to and shall be exercised by

    25
    the Unit Operator as herein provided.  Acceptable evidence of title to said rights shall be deposited

    26
    with  Unit  Operator  and,  together  with  this  agreement,  shall  constitute  and  define  the  rights,

    27
    privileges, and obligations of Unit Operator. Nothing herein, however, shall be construed to transfer

    28
    title  to  any land  or  to  any  lease  or  operating  agreement, it  being  understood  that  under  this

    29
    agreement the Unit Operator, in its capacity as Unit Operator, shall exercise the rights of possession

    30
    and use vested in the parties hereto only for the purposes herein specified.

    31
     

    32
    9. DRILLING TO DISCOVERY. Within 6 months after the effective date hereof, the

    33
    Unit Operator shall commence to drill an adequate test well at a location approved by the AO,

    34
    unless on such effective  date  a well  is being drilled in conformity with  the terms hereof, and

    35
    thereafter continue such drilling diligently until 500 feet below the top of the Triassic formation has

    36
    been tested or until at a lesser depth unitized substances shall be discovered which can be produced

    37
    in  paying quantities  (to-wit:  quantities  sufficient to  repay the costs of drilling, completing and

    38
    producing operations, with a reasonable profit) or the Unit Operator shall at any time establish to the

    39
    satisfaction of the AO that further drilling of said well would be unwarranted or impracticable,

    40
    provided, however, that Unit Operator shall not in any event be required to drill said well to a depth

    41
    in excess of 6,000 feet.  Until the discovery of unitized substances capable of being produced in

    42
    paying quantities, the Unit Operator shall continue drilling one well at a time, allowing not more

    43
    than 6 months between the completion of one well and the commencement of drilling operations for

    44
    the  next  well,  until  a  well  capable  of  producing  unitized  substances  in  paying  quantities  is

    45
    completed to the satisfaction of the AO or until it is reasonably proved that the unitized land is

    46
    incapable of producing unitized substances in paying quantities in the formations drilled hereunder.

     
    5

     
     

    1
    Nothing in this section shall be deemed to limit the right of the Unit Operator to resign as provided

    2
    in Section 5 hereof, or as requiring Unit Operator to commence or continue any drilling during the

    3
    period pending such resignation becoming effective in order to comply with the requirements of this

    4
    section.

    5
     

    6
    The AO may modify any of the drilling requirements of this section by granting reasonable

    7
    extensions of time when, in his opinion, such action is warranted.

    8
     

    9
    Until the establishment of a participating area, the failure to commence a well subsequent to

    10
    the drilling of the initial obligation well, or in the case of multiple well requirements, if specified,

    11
    subsequent to the drilling of those multiple wells, as provided for in this (these) section(s), within

    12
    the time allowed including any extension of time granted by the AO, shall cause this agreement to

    13
    terminate automatically.    Upon  failure  to  continue  drilling  diligently  any  well  other  than  the

    14
    obligation well(s) commenced hereunder, the AO may, after 15 days notice to the Unit Operator,

    15
    declare this unit agreement terminated.   Failure to commence drilling the initial obligation well, or

    16
    the first of multiple  obligation  wells,  on  time and  to drill  it diligently  shall  result in the unit

    17
    agreement approval being declared invalid ab initio by the AO. In the case of multiple well

    18
    requirements, failure to commence drilling the required multiple wells beyond the first well, and to

    19
    drill them diligently, may result in the unit agreement approval being declared invalid ab initio by

    20
    the AO.

    21
     

    22
    10. PLAN OF FURTHER  DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATION.   Within 6 months

    23
    after completion of a well capable of producing unitized substances in paying quantities, Operator

    24
    shall submit for the approval of the AO an acceptable plan of development and operation for the

    25
    unitized land which, when approved by the AO, shall constitute the further drilling and development

    26
    obligations of the Unit Operator under this agreement for the period specified therein.  Thereafter,

    27
    from time to time before the expiration of any existing plan, the Unit Operator shall submit for the

    28
    approval of the AO a plan for an additional specified period for the development and operation of

    29
    the unitized land.  Subsequent plans should normally be filed on a calendar year basis not later than

    30
    March 1 each year.  Any proposed modification or addition to the existing plan should be filed as a

    31
    supplement to the plan.

    32
     

    33
    Any plan submitted pursuant to this section shall provide for the timely exploration of the

    34
    unitized area, and for the diligent drilling necessary for determination of the area or areas capable of

    35
    producing unitized substances in paying quantities in each and every productive formation.   This

    36
    plan shall be as complete  and  adequate  as  the AO may determine  to  be  necessary for timely

    37
    development and proper conservation of the oil and gas resources of the unitized area and shall:

    38
     

    39
    (a)  specify the number and locations of any wells to be drilled and the proposed order and

    40
    time for such drilling; and

    41
     

    42
    (b)  provide a summary of operations and production for the previous year.

    43
     

    44
    Plans shall be modified or supplemented when necessary to meet changed conditions or to

    45
    protect the  interests of  all  parties to  this  agreement.   Reasonable diligence shall   be  exercised in

    46
    complying with the obligations of the approved plan of development and operation.  The AO is

     
    6

     
     

    1
    authorized to grant a reasonable extension of the 6 month period herein prescribed for submission of

    2
    an initial plan of development  and operation where such action is justified  because of unusual

    3
    conditions or circumstances.

    4
     

    5
    After completion of a well capable of producing unitized substances in paying quantities, no

    6
    further wells, except such as may be necessary to afford protection against operations not under this

    7
    agreement and  such  as  may  be  specifically  approved  by  the  AO,  shall  be  drilled  except  in

    8
    accordance with an approved plan of development and operation.

    9
     

    10
    11. PARTICIPATION  AFTER DISCOVERY. Upon completion  of a well capable of

    11
    producing unitized substances in paying quantities, or as soon thereafter as required by the AO, the

    12
    Unit Operator shall submit for approval by the AO, a schedule, based on subdivisions of the public-

    13
    land survey or aliquot parts thereof, of all land then regarded as reasonably proved to be productive

    14
    of unitized substances in paying quantities.   These lands shall constitute a participating area on

    15
    approval of the AO, effective as of the date of completion of such well or the effective date of this

    16
    unit agreement, whichever is later.   The acreages of both Federal and non-Federal lands shall be

    17
    based upon appropriate computations from the courses and distances shown on the last approved

    18
    public-land survey as of the effective date of each initial participating area.  The schedule shall also

    19
    set forth the percentage of unitized substances to be allocated, as provided in Section 12, to each

    20
    committed  tract  in  the  participating  area  so  established,  and  shall  govern  the  allocation  of

    21
    production commencing with the effective date of the participating area.   A different participating

    22
    area shall be established for each separate pool or deposit of unitized substances or for any group

    23
    thereof which is produced as a single pool or zone, and any two or more participating areas so

    24
    established may be combined into one, on approval of the AO.  When production from two or more

    25
    participating areas is subsequently found to be from a common pool or deposit, the participating

    26
    areas shall be combined into one, effective as of such appropriate date as may be approved or

    27
    prescribed by the AO.  The participating area or areas so established shall be revised from time to

    28
    time, subject to the approval of the AO, to include additional lands then regarded as reasonably

    29
    proved to be productive of unitized substances in paying quantities or which are necessary for unit

    30
    operations, or to exclude lands then regarded as reasonably proved not to be productive of unitized

    31
    substances  in  paying  quantities,  and  the  schedule  of  allocation  percentages  shall  be  revised

    32
    accordingly.   The  effective date  of  any revision shall be the first  of  the  month in which the

    33
    knowledge or information is obtained on which such revision is predicated; provided, however, that

    34
    a more appropriate effective date may be used if justified by Unit Operator and approved by the AO.

    35
    No  land  shall be  excluded  from  a  participating area  on  account  of  depletion  of  its  unitized

    36
    substances, except that any participating area established under the provisions of this unit agreement

    37
    shall terminate automatically whenever all completions in the formation on which the participating

    38
    area is based are abandoned.

    39
     

    40
    It is the intent of this section that a participating area shall represent the area known or

    41
    reasonably proved  to  be  productive  of  unitized  substances  in  paying  quantities  or  which are

    42
    necessary for unit operations; but, regardless of any revision of the participating area, nothing herein

    43
    contained shall be construed as requiring any retroactive adjustment for production obtained prior to

    44
    the effective date of the revision of the participating area.

    45
     

    46
     

     
    7

     
     

    1
    In the absence of agreement at any time between the Unit Operator and the AO as to the

    2
    proper definition or redefinition of a participating area, or until a participating area has, or areas

    3
    have, been established, the portion of all payments affected thereby shall, except royalty due the

    4
    United States, be impounded in a manner mutually acceptable to the owners of committed working

    5
    interests.  Royalties due the United States shall be determined by the AO and the amount thereof

    6
    shall be deposited, as directed by the AO, until a participating area is finally approved and then

    7
    adjusted in accordance with a determination of the sum due as Federal royalty on the basis of such

    8
    approved participating area.

    9
     

    10
    Whenever it is determined, subject to the approval of the AO, that a well drilled under this

    11
    agreement is not capable of production of unitized substances in paying quantities and inclusion in a

    12
    participating area of the land on which it is situated is unwarranted, production from such well shall,

    13
    for the purposes of settlement among all parties other than working interest owners, be allocated to

    14
    the land on which the well is located, unless such land is already within the participating area

    15
    established for the pool or deposit from which such production is obtained.  Settlement for working

    16
    interest benefits from such a nonpaying unit well shall be made as provided in the unit operating

    17
    agreement.

    18
     

    19
    12.  ALLOCATION  OF  PRODUCTION.    All  unitized  substances  produced  from  a

    20
    participating area established under this agreement, except any part thereof used in conformity with

    21
    good operating practices within the unitized area for drilling, operating and other production or

    22
    development purposes, for repressuring or recycling in accordance with a plan of development and

    23
    operations that has been approved by the AO, or unavoidably lost, shall be deemed to be produced

    24
    equally on an acreage basis from the several tracts of unitized land and unleased Federal land, if any,

    25
    included in the participating area established  for such production.    Each  such  tract shall have

    26
    allocated to it such percentage of said production as the number of acres of such tract included in

    27
    said participating area bears to the total acres of unitized land and unleased Federal land, if any,

    28
    included in said participating area.   There shall be allocated to the working interest owner(s) of

    29
    each tract of unitized land in said participating area, in addition, such percentage of the production

    30
    attributable to the unleased Federal land within the participating area as the number of acres of such

    31
    unitized tract included in said participating area bears to the total acres of unitized land in said

    32
    participating area, for the payment of  the compensatory royalty specified  in Section 17 of this

    33
    agreement.  Allocation of production hereunder for purposes other than for settlement of the royalty,

    34
    overriding  royalty, or payment  out of production obligations of  the respective working interest

    35
    owners, including compensatory royalty obligations under Section 17, shall be prescribed as set

    36
    forth in the unit operating agreement or as otherwise mutually agreed by the affected parties. It is

    37
    hereby agreed that production of unitized substances from a participating area shall be allocated as

    38
    provided herein, regardless of whether any wells are drilled on any particular part or tract of the

    39
    participating area.   If any gas produced  from one participating area is used for repressuring or

    40
    recycling purposes in another participating area, the first gas withdrawn from the latter participating

    41
    area for sale during the life of this agreement, shall be considered to be the gas so transferred, until

    42
    an amount equal to that transferred shall be so produced for sale and such gas shall be allocated to

    43
    the participating area from which initially produced as such area was defined at the time that such

    44
    transferred gas was finally produced and sold.

    45
     

    46
     

     
    8

     
     

    1
    13. DEVELOPMENT OR OPERATION OF NON-PARTICIPATING LAND OR

    2
    FORMATIONS.  Any operator may, with the approval of the AO, at such party's sole risk, cost,

    3
    and expense, drill a well on the unitized land to test any formation provided the well is outside any

    4
    participating area established for that formation, unless within 90 days of receipt of notice from said

    5
    party of his intention to drill the well, the Unit Operator elects and commences to drill the well in a

    6
    like manner as other wells are drilled by the Unit Operator under this agreement.

    7
     

    8
    If any well drilled under this section by a non-unit operator results in production of unitized

    9
    substances in paying quantities such that the land upon which it is situated may properly be included

    10
    in a participating area, such participating area shall be established or enlarged as provided in this

    11
    agreement and the well shall thereafter be operated by the Unit Operator in accordance with the

    12
    terms of this agreement and the unit operating agreement.

    13   

    14
    If any well drilled under this section by a non-unit operator obtains production in quantities

    15
    insufficient to justify the inclusion of the land upon which such well is situated in a participating

    16
    area, such  well  may  be operated  and produced  by the party drilling  the  same,  subject  to the

    17
    conservation requirements of this agreement.  The royalties in amount or value of production from

    18
    any such well shall be paid as specified in the underlying lease and agreements affected.

    19
     

    20
    14. ROYALTY SETTLEMENT. The United States and any State and any royalty owner

    21
    who is entitled to take in kind a share of the substances now unitized hereunder shall hereafter be

    22
    entitled to the right to take in kind its share of the unitized substances, and Unit Operator, or the

    23
    non-unit operator in the case of the operation of a well by a non-unit operator as herein provided for

    24
    in special cases, shall make deliveries of such royalty share taken in kind in conformity with the

    25
    applicable contracts, laws, and regulations. Settlement for royalty interest not taken in kind shall be

    26
    made by an operator responsible therefor under existing contracts, laws and regulations, or by the

    27
    Unit Operator on or before the last day of each month for unitized substances produced during the

    28
    preceding calendar month; provided, however, that nothing in this section shall operate to relieve

    29
    the responsible parties of any land from their respective lease obligations for the payment of any

    30
    royalties due under their leases.

    31
     

    32
    If gas obtained from lands not subject to this agreement is introduced into any participating

    33
    area hereunder, for use in repressuring, stimulation of production, or increasing ultimate recovery, in

    34
    conformity with a plan of development and operation approved by the AO, a like amount of gas,

    35
    after settlement as herein provided for any gas transferred from any other participating area and with

    36
    appropriate deduction for loss from any cause, may be withdrawn from the formation into which the

    37
    gas is introduced, royalty free as to dry gas, but not as to any products which may be extracted

    38
    therefrom; provided that such withdrawal shall be at such time as may be provided in the approved

    39
    plan of development and operation or as may otherwise be consented to by the AO as conforming to

    40
    good petroleum engineering practice; and provided further, that such right of withdrawal shall

    41
    terminate on the termination of this unit agreement.

    42
     

    43
    Royalty due the United States shall be computed as provided in 30 CFR Group 200 and paid

    44
    in value or delivered in kind as to all unitized substances on the basis of the amounts thereof

    45
    allocated to unitized Federal land as provided in Section 12 at the rates specified in the respective

    46
    Federal leases, or at such other rate or rates as may be authorized by law or regulation and approved

     
    9

     
     

    1
    by the AO; provided, that for leases on which the royalty rate depends on the daily average

    2
    production per well, said average production shall be determined in accordance with the operating

    3
    regulations as though each participating area were a single consolidated lease.

    4
     

    5
    15. RENTAL SETTLEMENT.   Rental or minimum royalties due on leases committed

    6
    hereto shall  be  paid by  the  appropriate parties under existing  contracts,  laws, and regulations,

    7
    provided that nothing herein contained shall operate to relieve the responsible parties of the land

    8
    from their respective obligations for the payment of any rental or minimum royalty due under their

    9
    leases.  Rental or minimum royalty for lands of the United States subject to this agreement shall be

    10
    paid at the rate specified  in  the respective leases from the United States  unless such rental or

    11
    minimum royalty is waived, suspended, or reduced by law or by approval of the Secretary or his

    12
    duly authorized representative.

    13                                                                      

    14
    With respect to any lease on non-Federal land containing provisions which would terminate

    15
    such lease unless drilling operations are commenced upon the land covered thereby within the time

    16
    therein specified or rentals are paid for the privilege of deferring such drilling operations, the rentals

    17
    required thereby shall, notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, be deemed to accrue

    18
    and become payable during the term thereof as extended by this agreement and until the required

    19
    drilling operations are commenced upon the land covered thereby, or until some portion of such

    20
    land is included within a participating area.

    21
     

    22
    16. CONSERVATION.   Operations hereunder and production of unitized substances shall

    23
    be conducted to provide for the most economical and efficient recovery of said substances without

    24
    waste, as defined by or pursuant to State or Federal law or regulation.

    25
     

    26
    17. DRAINAGE.

    27
     

    28
    (a)  The Unit Operator shall take such measures as the AO deems appropriate and adequate

    29
    to prevent drainage of unitized substances from unitized land by wells on land not subject to this

    30
    agreement, which shall include the drilling of protective wells and which may include the payment

    31
    of a fair and reasonable compensatory royalty, as determined by the AO.

    32
     

    33
    (b)   Whenever a participating area approved under Section 11 of this agreement contains

    34
    unleased Federal lands, the value of 12-112 percent of the production that would be allocated to such

    35
    Federal lands under Section 12 of this agreement, if such lands were leased, committed and entitled

    36
    to participation, shall be payable as compensatory royalties to the Federal Government.  Parties to

    37
    this agreement holding working interests in committed leases within the applicable participating

    38
    area shall be responsible  for such compensatory royalty payment on the volume of production

    39
    reallocated from the unleased Federal lands to their unitized tracts under Section 12.  The value of

    40
    such production subject to the payment of said royalties shall be determined pursuant to 30 CFR

    41
    Part 206.  Payment of compensatory royalties on the production reallocated from unleased Federal

    42
    land to the committed tracts within the participating area shall fulfill the Federal royalty obligation

    43
    for such production, and said production shall be subject to no further Federal royalty assessment

    44
    under Section 14 of this agreement.  Payment of compensatory royalties as provided herein shall

    45
    accrue from the date the committed tracts in the participating area that includes unleased Federal

    46
    land receive a production allocati :m, and shall be due and payable monthly by the last day of the

     
    10

     
     

    1
    calendar month next following the calendar month of actual production. If leased Federal lands

    2
    receiving a  production  allocation  from  the  participating  area  become  unleased,  compensatory

    3
    royalties shall accrue from the date the Federal lands become unleased.   Payment due under this

    4
    provision shall  end  when  the  unleased Federal tract is leased or  when  production of  unitized

    5
    substances ceases within the participating area and the participating area is terminated, whichever

    6
    occurs first.

    7
     

    8
    18.  LEASES  AND  CONTRACTS  CONFORMED  AND  EXTENDED.    The  terms,

    9
    conditions, and provisions  of  all  leases, subleases, and other  contracts  relating  to exploration,

    10
    drilling, development, or operation for oil or gas on lands committed to this agreement are hereby

    11
    expressly modified and amended to the extent necessary to make the same conform to the provisions

    12
    hereof, but otherwise to remain in full force and effect; and the parties hereto hereby consent that the

    13
    Secretary shall  and  by  his  approval  hereof, or  by the  approval  hereof  by his duly authorized

    14
    representative, does  hereby  establish,  alter,  change,  or  revoke  the  drilling,  producing,  rental,

    15
    minimum royalty, and royalty requirements of Federal leases committed hereto and the regulations

    16
    in respect thereto to conform said requirements to the provisions of this agreement, and, without

    17
    limiting the generality of the foregoing, all leases, subleases, and contracts are particularly modified

    18
    in accordance with the following:

    19
     

    20
    (a) The development and operation oflands subject to this agreement under the terms hereof

    21
    shall be deemed full performance of all obligations for development and operation with respect to

    22
    each and every separately owned tract subject to this agreement, regardless of whether there is any

    23
    development of any particular tract of this unit area.

    24
     

    25
    (b)  Drilling and producing operations performed hereunder upon any tract of unitized lands

    26
    will be accepted and deemed to be performed upon and for the benefit of each and every tract of

    27
    unitized land, and no lease shall be deemed to expire by reason of failure to drill or produce wells

    28
    situated on the land therein embraced.

    29
     

    30
    (c) Suspension of drilling or producing operations on all unitized lands pursuant to direction

    31
    or consent of the AO shall be deemed to constitute such suspension pursuant to such direction or

    32
    consent as to each and every tract of unitized land. A suspension of drilling or producing operations

    33
    limited to specified lands shall be applicable only to such lands.

    34
     

    35
    (d)   Each lease, sublease or contract relating to the exploration, drilling, development, or

    36
    operation for oil or gas of lands other than those of the United States committed to this agreement

    37
    which, by its terms might expire prior to the termination of this agreement, is hereby extended

    38
    beyond any such term so provided therein so that it shall be continued in full force and effect for and

    39
    during the term of this agreement.

    40
     

    41
    (e)  Any Federal lease committed hereto shall continue in force beyond the term so provided

    42
    therein or by law as to the land committed so long as such lease remains subject hereto, provided

    43
    that production of unitized substances in paying quantities is established under this unit agreement

    44
    prior to the expiration date of the term of such lease, or in the event actual drilling operations are

    45
    commenced on unitized land, in accordance with provisions of this agreement, prior to the end of

    46
    the primary term of such lease and are being diligently prosecuted at that time, such lease shall be

     
    11

     
     

    1
    extended for two years, and so long thereafter as oil or gas is produced in paying quantities in

    2
    accordance with the provisions of the Mineral Leasing Act, as amended.

    3
     

    4
    (f)    Each  sublease  or  contract  relating  to  the  operation  and  development  of  unitized

    5
    substances from lands of the United States committed to this agreement, which by its terms would

    6
    expire prior to the time at which the underlying lease, as extended by the immediately preceding

    7
    paragraph, will expire, is hereby extended beyond any such term so provided therein so that it shall

    8
    be continued in full force and effect for and during the term of the underlying lease as such term is

    9
    herein extended.

    10
     

    11
    (g)  The segregation of any Federal lease committed to this agreement is governed by the

    12
    following provision in the fourth paragraph of Sec. 17(m) of the Mineral Leasing Act, as amended

    13
    by the Act of September 2, 1960, (74 Stat. 781-784) (30 U.S.C. 226 (m)): "Any (Federal) lease

    14
    heretofore or hereafter committed to any such (unit) plan embracing lands that are in part within and

    15
    in part outside of the area covered by any such plan shall be segregated into separate leases as to the

    16
    lands committed and the lands not committed as of the effective date of unitization: Provided,

    17
    however, that any such lease as to the non-unitized portion shall continue in force and effect for the

    18
    term thereof but for not less than two years from the date of such segregation and so long thereafter

    19
    as oil or gas is produced in paying quantities."  If the public interest requirement is not satisfied, the

    20
    segregation of a lease and/or extension of a lease pursuant to 43 CFR 3107.3-2 and 43 CFR 3107.4,

    21
    respectively, shall not be effective.

    22
     

    23
    (h)   Any lease, other than a Federal lease, having only a portion of its lands committed

    24
    hereto shall be segregated as to the portion committed and the portion not committed, and the

    25
    provisions of such lease shall apply separately to such segregated portions commencing as of the

    26
    effective date hereof. In the event any such lease provides for a lump-sum rental payment, such

    27
    payment shall be prorated between the portions so segregated in proportion to the acreage of the

    28
    respective tracts.

    29
     

    30
    19. COVENANTS RUN WITH LAND.  The covenants herein shall be construed to be

    31
    covenants running  with  the  land  with  respect to  the  interests  of  the  parties  hereto  and  their

    32
    successors in interest until  this agreement terminates, and any grant, transfer or conveyance of

    33
    interest in land or leases subject hereto shall be and hereby is conditioned upon the assumption of all

    34
    privileges and obligations hereunder by the grantee, transferee, or other successor in interest.  No

    35
    assignment or transfer of  any working interest royalty, or other interest subject hereto shall be

    36
    binding upon Unit Operator until the first day of the calendar month after Unit Operator is furnished

    37
    with the original, photostatic, or certified copy of the instrument of transfer.

    38
     

    39
    20.  EFFECTIVE  DATE  AND  TERM.    This  agreement shall  become  effective upon

    40
    approval of the AO and shall automatically terminate five (5) years from said effective date unless:

    41
     

    42
    (a) upon application by the Unit Operator such date of expiration is extended by the AO, or

    43
     

    44
    (b)  it is reasonably determined prior to the expiration of the fixed term or any extension

    45
    thereof that the unitized land is incapable of production of unitized substances in paying quantities

    46
    in the formations tested hereunder, and after notice of intention to terminate this agreement on such

     
    12

     
     

    1
    ground is given by the Unit Operator to all parties in interest at their last known addresses, this

    2
    agreement is terminated with approval of the AO, or

    3
     

    4
    (c)   a  valuable discovery of  unitized substances in paying quantities  has been made or

    5
    accepted on unitized land  during said initial term or any extension thereof, in which event this

    6
    agreement shall remain in effect for such term and so long thereafter as unitized substances can be

    7
    produced in quantities sufficient to pay for the cost of producing same from wells on unitized land

    8
    within any participating area established hereunder. Should production cease and diligent drilling or

    9
    reworking operations to restore production or new production are not in progress within 60 days and

    10
    production  is  not restored  or  should  new  production not  be obtained  in  paying  quantities  on

    11
    committed lands within this unit area, this agreement will automatically terminate effective the last

    12
    day of the month in which the last unitized production occurred, or

    13                                                                                   

    14
    (d)  it is voluntarily terminated as provided in this agreement.  Except as noted herein this

    15
    agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the discovery of unitized substances which can be

    16
    produced in paying quantities by not less than 75 per centum, on an acreage basis, of the working

    17
    interest owners signatory hereto, with the approval of the AO.  The Unit Operator shall give notice

    18
    of any such approval to all parties hereto.   If the public interest requirement is not satisfied, the

    19
    approval of this unit by the AO shall be invalid.

    20
     

    21
    21. RATE OF PROSPECTING, DEVELOPMENT, AND PRODUCTION.  The AO is

    22
    hereby vested with authority to alter or modify from time to time, in his discretion, the quantity and

    23
    rate of production under this agreement  when such quantity and rate are not fixed pursuant to

    24
    Federal or State law, or  do  not conform to any Statewide voluntary conservation  or allocation

    25
    program which is established, recognized, and generally adhered to by the majority of operators in

    26
    such State.  The above authority is hereby limited to alteration or modifications which are in the

    27
    public interest.  The public interest to be served and the purpose thereof, must be stated in the order

    28
    of alteration or modification.  Without regard to the foregoing, the AO is also hereby vested with

    29
    authority to  alter or  modify  from  time  to  time, in his discretion,  the  rate  of  prospecting and

    30
    development and the quantity and rate of production under this agreement when such alteration or

    31
    modification is in the interest of attaining the conservation objectives stated in this agreement and is

    32
    not in violation of any applicable Federal or State law.

    33
     

    34
    Powers in this section vested in the AO shall only be exercised after notice to Unit Operator

    35
    and opportunity for hearing to be held not less than 15 days from notice.

    36
     

    37
    22. APPEARANCES.  The Unit Operator shall, after notice to other parties affected, have

    38
    the right to appear for and on behalf of any and all interests affected hereby before the Department

    39
    of the Interior and to appeal from orders issued under the regulations of said Department, or to apply

    40
    for relief from any of said  regulations, or in any proceedings relative to operations  before the

    41
    Department, or any other legally constituted authority; provided, however, that any other interested

    42
    party shall also have the right at its own expense to be heard in any such proceeding.

    43
     

    44
    23.  NOTICES.  All  notices,  demands,  or statements required hereunder  to  be given or

    45
    rendered to the parties hereto shall be in writing and shall be personally delivered to the party or

    46
     

     
    13

     
     

    1
    parties,  or sent by postpaid  registered  or certified  mail, to the last known  address  of the party or

    2
    parties.

    3
     

    4
    24. NO WAIVER OF CERTAIN RIGHTS.  Nothing herein contained  in this agreement

    5
    shall be construed  as a waiver  by any party hereto of the right to assert any legal or constitutional

    6
    right or defense as to the validity or invalidity  of any law of the State where the unitized  lands are

    7
    located, or of the United States, or regulations  issued thereunder in any way affecting such party, or

    8
    as a waiver by any such party of any right beyond his or its authority to waive.

    9
     

    10
    25. UNAVOIDABLE DELAY.   All obligations  under  this  agreement  requiring  the Unit

    11
    Operator  to commence  or continue  drilling,  or to operate on, or produce  unitized  substances  from

    12
    any of the lands covered by this agreement,  shall be suspended while the Unit Operator, despite the

    13
    exercise of due care and diligence,  is prevented  from complying with such obligations,  in whole or

    14
    in part, by strikes, acts of God, Federal, State, or municipal law or agencies,  unavoidable accidents,

    15
    uncontrollable  delays in transportation, inability  to obtain  necessary  materials  or equipment  in the

    16
    open market, or other matters beyond the reasonable control of the Unit Operator  whether similar to

    17
    matters herein enumerated or not.

    18
     

    19
    26. NONDISCRIMINATION. In connection with the performance of work under this

    20
    agreement,  the Unit Operator  agrees  to comply  with  all the provisions  of Section  202 (1) to (7)

    21
    inclusive of Executive Order 11246 (30 F.R. 12319), as amended, which are hereby incorporated by

    22
    reference in this agreement.

    23
     

    24
    27. LOSS OF TITLE. In the event title to any tract of unitized land shall fail and the true

    25
    owner cannot be induced to join in this unit agreement, such tract shall be automatically  regarded as

    26
    not committed  hereto, and there shall be such readjustment  of future costs and benefits as may be

    27
    required on account of the loss of such title. In the event of a dispute as to title to any royalty,

    28
    working  interest, or other interest  subject  thereto,  payment or delivery  on account  thereof may be

    29
    withheld  without liability for interest until the dispute is finally settled; provided,  that, as to Federal

    30
    lands or leases, no payments  of funds due the United States shall be withheld,  but such funds shall

    31
    be deposited  as directed  by the AO, to be held as unearned money pending  final settlement  of the

    32
    title dispute, and then applied as earned or returned in accordance with such final settlement.

    33
     

    34
    Unit Operator as such is relieved from any responsibility for any defect or failure of any title

    35
    hereunder.

    36
     

    37
    28. NON-JOINDER AND SUBSEQUENT JOINDER.   If the  owner  of any substantial

    38
    interest in a tract within the unit area fails or refuses to subscribe  or consent  to this agreement, the

    39
    owner  of the working interest  in that tract may withdraw  the tract from this agreement  by written

    40
    notice delivered to the proper Bureau of Land Management office and the Unit Operator prior to the

    41
    approval  of this agreement  by the AO.   Any oil or gas interests  in lands within  the unit area not

    42
    committed  hereto prior to final approval may thereafter be committed hereto by the owner or owners

    43
    thereof subscribing or consenting  to this agreement, and, if the interest is a working interest, by the

    44
    owner  of  such  interest  also  subscribing  to  the  unit  operating  agreement.    After  operations  are

    45
    commenced  hereunder,  the right of subsequent  joinder,  as provided  in this section,  by a working

    46
    interest owner is subject to such requirements  or approval(s),  if any, pertaining  to such joinder, as

     
    14

     
     

    1
    may be provided for in the unit operating agreement. After final approval hereof, joinder by a non-

    2
    working interest owner must be consented to in writing by the working interest owner committed

    3
    hereto and responsible for the payment of any benefits that may accrue hereunder in behalf of such

    4
    non-working interest.  A non-working interest may not be committed to this unit agreement unless

    5
    the corresponding working interest is committed hereto.  Joinder to the unit agreement by a working

    6
    interest owner, at any time,  must  be accompanied  by appropriate joinder  to the  unit operating

    7
    agreement, in order for the interest to be regarded as committed to this agreement.  Except as may

    8
    otherwise herein be provided, subsequent joinders to this agreement shall be effective as of the date

    9
    of the filing with the AO of duly executed counterparts of all or any papers necessary to establish

    10
    effective commitment of any interest and/or tract to this agreement.

    11
     

    12
    29. COUNTERPARTS.  This agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts,

    13
    no one of which needs to be executed by all parties, or may be ratified or consented to by separate

    14
    instrument in writing specifically referring hereto and shall be binding upon all those parties who

    15
    have executed such a counterpart, ratification, or consent hereto with the same force and effect as if

    16
    all such parties had signed the same document, and regardless of whether or not it is executed by all

    17
    other parties owning or claiming an interest in the lands within the above-described unit area.

    18
     

    19
    30. SPECIAL SURFACE STIPULATIONS.   Nothing in this agreement shall modify the

    20
    special Federal lease stipulations attached to the individual Federal oil and gas leases.

    21
     

    22
    31. SURRENDER.  Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the exercise by any working

    23
    interest owner of the right to surrender vested in such party by any lease, sublease, or operating

    24
    agreement as to all or any part of the lands covered thereby, provided that each party who will or

    25
    might acquire such working interest by such surrender or by forfeiture as hereafter set forth, is

    26
    bound by the terms of this Agreement.

    27
     

    28
    If as a result of any surrender, the working interest rights as to such lands become vested in

    29
    any party other than the fee owner of the Unitized Substances, said party may forfeit such rights and

    30
    further benefits from operations hereunder as to said land to the party next in the chain of title who

    31
    shall be and become the owner of such working interest.

    32
     

    33
    If as the result of any such surrender of forfeiture working interest rights become vested in

    34
    the fee owner of the Unitized Substances, such owner may:

    35
     

    36
    (a)  Accept  those working  interest  rights subject to  this Agreement  and the Unit

    37
    Operating Agreement; or

    38
     

    39
    (b) Lease the portion of such land as is included in a participating area established

    40
    hereunder subject to this Agreement and the Unit Operating Agreement; or

    41
     

    42
    (c) Provide for the independent operation of any part of such land that is not then

    43
    included within a participating area established hereunder.

    44
     

    45
    If  the  fee  owner of  the  Unitized Substances  does   not  accept the  working  interest rights

    46
    subject to this Agreement and the Unit Operating Agreement or lease such lands as above provided

     
    15

     
     

    1

ARTICLE 6

APPORTIONMENT OF
COSTS AND OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF PRODUCTION AND PROPERTY

 

6.1 Apportionment
and Ownership Within Participating Area. Except as otherwise provided in Articles 8,
9, 11, and 12:

 

A. Costs. All Costs
incurred in the development and operation
of a participating area  for or
in connection with production of unitized substances
from any pool or zone for which such participating area is established
shall be borne by the Parties within such participating area on an Acreage Basis, determined as of the time such Costs 
are incurred.

 

B. Production.
All Production from a participating area shall
be allocated on an Acreage Basis
to the tracts of unitized land within
such participating area. That portion of such
Production which is allocated to any such tract shall be owned by the Party or Parties
having Committed Working Interest or Interests
therein in the same manner and subject to
the same conditions as if actually produced from such tract through
a well thereon and as if this Agreement and the Unit
Agreement had not been executed.

 

C. Property.
All materials, equipment, and
other property, whether real or personal, the cost of which is chargeable as Costs and which have been acquired
in connection with the development
or operation of a participating area, shall
be owned by the Parties within
such participating area  on an Acreage Basis.

 

6.2 Ownership and
Costs Outside Participating Area. If a
well Drilled (including the Deepening or Plugging
Back thereof)  within a Drilling Block
established under the provisions  of either
Article 9 or Article  10 is completed as a producer but not included within a participating
area, then the following provisions shall be applicable:

 

A. When All Drilling
Block Parties Participate. If
all Parties within the Drilling Block
shall have elected to participate in Drilling and  Completing
such well, then said well, the  Production therefrom,
and the materials and equipment therein or appurtenant thereto shall be
owned by such Parties; and all Costs  incurred
in the operation of such well and all  Lease Burdens
payable in respect of Production from such well
shall  be borne and paid by
said Parties. Apportionment among said Parties of ownership, Costs, and Lease
Burdens shall be in
the same proportions in which Costs incurred in Drilling the well were borne.

 

B. When Less Than
All Drilling Block Parties Participate. If
any Party within the Drilling Block shall
have elected not to participate in Drilling
or Completing such well, then the provisions of Article 12 shall be applicable
thereto; and the relinquished interest of the
Non-Drilling Party shall revert to it in the same manner and under the same conditions as provided in
Section 12.4 with respect to a well which results in the establishment
or enlargement of a participating
area, except that  the proceeds or market
value to be used in
determining when such reversion shall occur shall be the proceeds  or market
value (after making the deductions provided for in Section 12.4) of that portion of the Production obtained from the well 
which, had the Non-Drilling Party elected to participate in the Drilling
or Completing thereof, would have been allocable, on an Acreage Basis within
 the Drilling Block, to the Non-Drilling
Party. Upon reversion of the relinquished
interest of the Non-Drilling Party in such well, the provisions of Section 12.5 shall become applicable.

 

6.3 Cost Liability
of Subsequently Created Interests. Anything herein
to the contrary not withstanding, if, subsequent
to the date of this Agreement,
any Party shall create an overriding royalty, production payment, net proceeds
interest, carried interest, or any other interest
out of its Committed Working Interest (hereinafter called "Subsequently
Created Interest"), such Subsequently Created Interest shall be made expressly
subject to the terms and provisions  of
this Section  6.3 and  of
Section 12.9. If the Party which
created such Subsequently Created Interest fails to pay, when due, its share
of Costs and the proceeds from its share of Production are 
insufficient to cover such Costs, then the Subsequently Created Interest shall
be chargeable with a pro  rata share of such Costs as if such Subsequently Created Interest
were a Committed Working  Interest; and Unit 
Operator shall have the right to enforce against such  Subsequently
Created Interest the  lien  and all
other rights granted in Section 15.5 for the purpose  of collecting Costs 
chargeable to the Subsequently Created Interest.

 

6.4 Taking
in Kind. Each Party shall currently, as
produced, take in kind or separately dispose of its share of Production
and pay Unit Operator for any extra expenditure
necessitated thereby. Except as
otherwise provided in Section 15.5, each Party
shall be entitled to receive directly
all proceeds from the sale of its share of Production. Unit Operator shall timely
make all permitted governmental filings relative to the price to be
charged for gas; however, Unit Operator shall not be liable if, through mistake
or oversight, it should fail to make any such filing or should make  erroneous
filings.

 

6.5 Failure
to Take in Kind. Should  any Party fail
to take in kind or separately dispose of
its share of Production, the Party acting as Unit Operator shall have the  right,
revocable at will by the Party owning such share, to purchase such share for its  own
account at not less  than  the market price

receives for its own share of
Production; provided that all such sales shall 
be only for such reasonable periods
of time as are consistent with the minimum
needs of the industry under 
the circumstances, but not to exceed one (1) year. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Unit Operator shall not sell or commit
any Party's share of gas Production to a
sale without first giving such Party not less than ninety (90) days written notice.

 

6.6 Surplus
Materials and Equipment. Materials and equipment
owned by the Parties or by
any of them pursuant to this Agreement
may be classified as surplus
by Unit Operator when deemed bv it to be no longer needed in operations hereunder,
by giving to each  Party owning an interest therein notice thereof. Such
surplus materials and equipment shall be disposed of as follows:

 

A. Each
Party owning an interest therein shall have the right to take in kind its share of surplus
tubular goods and other surplus items which are susceptible
of division in kind, by notice given 
to Unit Operator within thirty (30) days 
after classification thereof  as surplus,
except that such right shall not apply to junk or to any item (other 
than tubular goods) having a replacement
cost of less than Seven Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($7,500.00).

 

B. Surplus
materials and equipP1ent not divided  in kind, other than junk and any item (other
than tubular goods) having a replacement
cost of less than Seven Thousand Five Hundred
Dollars ($7,500.00), shall be sold to the  highest bidder or bidders.

each Drilling Party shall have a
period of twenty-four (24) hours (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays) from
and  after receipt of such  proposal within
which to notify Unit Operator whether or not it elects  to participate in the Completion
attempt. The failure of a Party
to signify its election within said 24-hour
period shall be deemed an election not to participate in the Completion attempt.

 

E. Effect
of Election. The Party or Parties
electing to participate in an attempt
to Complete a well as above provided shall constitute the Completing Party for such operation. Each
Party who was entitled to make such election but failed to do so as above provided shall be a Non-Completing Party with
respect to such operation. Such  operation

Party. However, such Party shall be bound by any and
all Directions and Approvals theretofore given by the Drilling Party concerning
the Drilling of the well.

 

G. Effect of Election.
If one or more, but not all, of the Parties
within the Drilling Block elect to proceed with 
the Drilling of the well, Unit
Operator shall Drill the well for the account of
such Party or Parties, who
shall constitute the Drilling Party, on
an Acreage Basis among themselves, or on such  other basis as said Parties may
 specify.

 

H. Rights and Obligations
of Drilling Party and Non-Drilling Party. Whenever an Exploratory Well is Drilled
otherwise than for the account of all Parties
within the Drilling Block involved, the provisions of Article 12 shall be applicable to such operation.

 

9.3 Attempted Completion.
The attempted Completion of Exploratory  Wells 
Drilled to their projected depths shall be governed by the following provisions:

 

A. Notice by Unit
Operator. After an Exploratory Well has

ARTICLE 10

REQUIRED WELLS

 

10.1 Definition.
For the purpose of this Article, a well shall be deemed a Required Well if the Drilling thereof
is required by a final order of the Appropriate
Agency. Such an order shall be deemed final upon expiration
of the time allowed for appeal therefrom
without the commencement of
appropriate appeal proceedings or, if such proceedings
are commenced within said time,
upon the final disposition of the appeal. Whenever Unit Operator receives any such order, it shall promptly mail a copy
thereof to each Party. If
any such order is appealed, the Party appealing shall give prompt notice thereof
to Unit Operator and to each of the other Parties, and, upon final disposition of
the appeal, Unit Operator shall give each  Party prompt notice of the result thereof.

 

10.2 Election
to Drill. Any Party desiring to
Drill, or to participate in the Drilling of, a Required Well
shall give to Unit Operator notice
thereof within thirty (30) days after the order requiring such well becomes
final or within such lesser time as may be
required to insure compliance
with such order. If such notice is given  within said period, Unit Operator
shall Drill  the Required Well for the account of the Party
or Parties giving such notice; provided, however, if
the Required Well is a Development Well, it shall not be Drilled unless it receives
the Approval  of the Parties within the
participating area involved. All rights and obligations
with respect to the ownership of such
well, the operating rights therein, the Production therefrom,
and the bearing of Costs incurred therein
shall  be the same as if
the well had been Drilled under Article 8, if the same is a Development Well,
 or under Article 9,  if the same is an
Exploratory Well or a Subsequent Test Well.

 

10.3 Alternatives
to Drilling. If no Party elects
to Drill a Required Well within the period
allowed for such election, and if any
of the following alternatives is available,
the first such alternative which is available shall be followed:

 

A. Compensatory
Royalties. If compensatory royalties
may be paid in lieu of Drilling the well and if payment thereof receives, within
said period, the Approval of the Parties who would be chargeable with the Costs  incurred
in Drilling the well  if the well  were
Drilled as  provided in Section 10.4, Unit Operator shall 
pay such compensatory royalties for
the account of said Parties; or

 

B. Contraction.
If the Drilling of the well may
be avoided, without other 
penalty, by contraction of the Unit Area, Unit 
Operator shall make a reasonable effort to effect such contraction; or

 

C. Termination.
If the Required  Well is a Subsequent Test Well, the Parties shall join 
in termination of the  Unit Agreement in accordance with its provisions.

 

10.4 Required Drilling.
If none of the foregoing alternatives
is available, Unit Operator shall Drill
the Required Well under whichever of the following provisions is applicable:

 

A. Development
Well. If the Required Well is a Development Well,
it shall be Drilled by Unit Operator for the account of all Parties within the participating
area in which the well is Drilled; or

 

B. Exploratory
Well. If the Required Well is an Exploratory Well,
the Drilling Block for such well shall
consist of all forty (40) acre subdivisions and lots of the Public Land Survey 
of which more than one-half  of the
surface area is within a distance of 2,640 feet from the  proposed bottom 
hole location of such  well, but
excluding therefrom all lands within any  participating
area theretofore

the notice provided for in Subdivision
A of this Section 11.1 has consented to
the plugging and abandonment of such  well:

 

A. Notice by Unit
Operator. Before abandoning any well which has been Drilled to
its original projected  depth but  not
completed as a producer of unitized substances, Unit 
Operator shall give notice of its intention to
plug and abandon such well to each Drilling Party and Non-Drilling Party.

 

B. Right to Initiate
Proposal. Each Party who participated in the Drilling of a well
concerning which notice  is g1ven in accordance with 
Subdivision A of this Section 11.1 and any other Party owning a Committed
Working Interest in the tract of land on which the well is located may initiate
a proposal to attempt to Deepen or
Plug Back such well; provided, however, if the well was Drilled as a Development Well, a proposal 
to Deepen  or Plug  Back may be
initiated only by a Party owning a Committed Working Interest in the 
tract of land on which the well is located.

 

C. Right to Participate.
In order to be entitled to participate
in a Deepening or Plugging Back operation, a Party must have the  right to initiate
the same or must own a Committed Working Interest in the Drilling
Block theretofore established for Drilling the well involved; if no Drilling
Block was theretofore established for Drilling
such  well, the Drilling Block for
such  Deepening or Plugging Back operation
shall be established automatically in accordance with the provisions of Subdivision B of Section 10.4, which shall be applicable
hereto.

 

D. Time and Manner
of Initiating Proposal. A period of twenty-four (24) hours (exclusive of Saturdays,
Sundays, and holidays) from and 
after receipt of the notice given pursuant
to Subdivision A of this Section 11.1 shall be allowed within which  a Party
entitled to do so may initiate a proposal  to
Deepen or Plug  Back. Any such proposal  shall
be initiated by giving notice thereof to Unit Operator and to each Party entitled to participate in the proposed operation. If
no such proposal is initiated within said period, Unit Operator shall plug and abandon the well for the account of the Completing
Party if a Completion attempt was made or, if not, then for the account of the Drilling
Party.

 

E. Election. If
a proposal to Deepen or Plug Back a well is initiated, each  Party entitled to participate
in  the operation proposed shall have a period of forty-eight (48) hours (exclusive
of Saturdays, Sundays, and  holidays) from
and  after receipt of such  proposal within
which to notify Unit Operator whether or
not it elects to participate in the proposed operation. The failure of
a Party to signify its election within said 48-hour period shall be
deemed an election not to participate
in the proposed operation.

 

F. Effect
of Election. The Party or Parties electing
to participate in an operation to Deepen
or Plug Back a well as above provided shall
constitute the Participating Party for
such operation. Each Party who was entitled to make such election but failed to do so as 
above provided shall be a Non-Participating Party with respect  to
such operation. Such operation shall
be conducted by Unit Operator for the account of the Party
or Parties constituting the Participating
Party, on an Acreage Basis among themselves, subject, however, to the provisions of
Section  11.2 and Section 11.3. If the
Party or Parties making such  election do
not proceed with the operation, the  Costs incurred in plugging and abandoning the well
shall be charged and borne as part of the Costs incurred in Drilling the well.

 

G. Rights and Obligations
of Participating Party and Non-Participating Party. Upon the commencement of a Deepening or Plugging Back operation otherwise than
for the account of all Parties entitled to participate therein, the provisions of Article 12 shall be applicable to such operation.

 

11.2 Deepening
or Plugging Back to Participating Area. If
a well within the surface boundaries of a participating
area is to be Deepened or Plugged Back to the pool
or zone for which such participating area 
was established, such operation, including
the Completion of such well, may be conducted
 only if it receives the Approval of the
Parties within such participating area, and only upon  such terms and conditions as
may be specified in such Approval, and
upon such further terms and conditions as may be agreed to by the Parties owning interests
in the well immediately prior  to the commencement of
any such Deepening or Plugging Back operation.

 

11.3 Conflicts.
If conflicting elections to attempt to Deepen
or Plug Back are made in accordance with the provisions of this Article 11, preference shall be given first to 
Deepening. However, if a Deepening attempt does not result in completion of
the well as a producer of unitized substances, Unit Operator shall again give
notice in accordance with Subdivision A of Section
11.1 before plugging and abandoning the well.

 

11.4 Attempted
Completion. Except as otherwise provided in Section 11.2, the attempted Completion
of a well Deepened or Plugged Back to the depth projected  for such Deepening
or Plugging Back operation shall be governed by the provisions of Section 9.3, unless every Participating Party has

ROCKY MOUNTAIN UNIT OPERATING AGREEMENT

Form
2 (Divided Interest)

February, 1980 (Page 9 Revised 1985)

 

consented to the plugging
and abandonment of such well, in
which event Unit Operator
shall plug and abandon the well for the account of the Participating Party.

 

11.5 
Abandonment of Producing Wells. A well completed as  a producer of unitized
substances within a participating area
shall be abandoned for plugging
if and when abandonment thereof
receives the Approval of the Parties
within such  participating area, subject,
however, to the  provisions of Section
11.6. The abandonment of a well completed as a producer
but not included in a participating area shall be governed by the following
provisions:

 

A. Consent
Required. Such well shall not be
abandoned for production from the 
pool or zone in which it is Completed, except with the consent of all Parties then owning the well.

 

B. Abandonment
Procedure. If the abandonment of such well receives the Approval of the Parties who own the well but is not consented to by all
such Parties, Unit Operator shall give
notice thereof to each Party, if any, then
having an  interest
in the well who did  not join in such Approval. Any such non-joining Party who
objects to abandonment of the well (herein called
Non-Abandoning Party) may give notice thereof to all 
other Parties (herein called Abandoning Parties)
then having interests in the well,  provided such no lice is given
within thirty (30) days after
receipt of the notice given by Unit Operator. If such objection is so
made, the Non-Abandoning Party or Parties shall forthwith pay to the Abandoning
Parties their respective shares of the Salvage Value of the well. Upon 
the making of such payment, the
Abandoning Parties shall be deemed to have
relinquished to the Non-Abandoning Party or Parties all their operating
rights and working interest in the well, but 
only with respect to the  pool or
zone in which it is then Completed, and all their interest
in the materials and equipment in or pertaining
to the well. If there is more than one Non-Abandoning Party,
the interests so relinquished shall be owned by the Non-Abandoning Parties in the proportions which their respective interests
in  the well bear to the total of
their interests therein immediately prior to such relinquishment.

 

C. 
Rights and Obligations of  Non-Abandoning
Party. After the relinquishment  above provided for, such well shall be operated
by Unit Operator for the account of the
Non-Abandoning Party or Parties, who shall own
all Production therefrom and shall bear all Costs, Lease Burdens, and 
other burdens thereafter  incurred in operating the 
well and plugging it when abandoned (unless
the well is taken over for Deepening or Plugging
Back as hereinafter provided) and
also  the Costs of any additional tankage,
flow  lines, or  other facilities needed
to measure separately the unitized substances
produced from the well. Costs shall include an overhead
charge computed at the highest
per well rate applicable to the operation of a single producing well in accordance
with Exhibit 1, if such rate is provided.

 

D. Option to Repurchase
Materials. If a  well taken over by the Non-Abandoning Party 
or Parties as above provided is
abandoned for plugging within six (6)
months after relinquishment  by the Abandoning
Parties of their interests therein, each Abandoning Party shall have the right at
its option to repurchase that portion of the materials
and equipment salvaged from the well which
is equal to the interest relinquished by it to the Non-Abandoning Party or
Parties, at the  value previously fixed
 therefor. Said option may
be exercised only by notice given to
Unit Operator and to the Non-Abandoning Party or Parties within fifteen
(15) days after receipt of the
notice given by Unit Operator pursuant to Section 11.6.

 

11.6 Deepening
or Plugging Back Abandoned Producing Wells. Before plugging any  well authorized for
abandonment pursuant to Section 11.5, Unit Operator shall give notice to  the Party
or Parties owning Committed Working Interests
in the tract of land upon which the well
is located, which Parties, for the further purposes of this
Section 11.6,  shall constitute
the Parties entitled to initiate
and participate in  a proposed
Deepening or Plugging Back operation. Within ten (10) days after receipt of said
 notice, any such Party desiring the Deepening or Plugging Back of such 
well shall give notice thereof to Unit Operator
and to each Party entitled to participate
in the proposed operation; and  all the provisions of
Subdivisions E, F, and  G of
Section 11.1 shall apply in the
same manner as
if the proposed Deepening or Plugging Back  were a proposal
for the Drilling of an Exploratory Well,
subject, however, to the provisions
of Section 11.2 and Section
11.3. If no Party gives notice 
of desire to Deepen or Plug Back
such well within said period often ( 10)
day. or if such notice is given
but no party elects to proceed with the
 Deepening or Plugging Back of the well
within the time specified therefor, Unit Operator
shall plug and abandon the well for the account of the Party or Parties owning the
well.

 

ARTICLE 12

RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF DRILLING
PARTY AND NON-DRILLING PARTY

 

12.1 Use of Terms.
As used in this Article, the terms "Drilling
Party" and "Non-Drilling Party" are to be 
understood as including "Completing Party" and "Non-Completing
Party" and "Participating Party" and "Non-Participating
Party", respectively, as such terms are used in Articles 8, 
9, and 11.

 

12.2 
Scope of Article. The rights and obligations of the Drilling Party
and Non-Drilling Party with respect to any Drilling, Deepening, Plugging Back, or
Completion operation conducted otherwise than for the account of  all Parties entitled
to participate therein shall be governed  by the succeeding provisions
of this Article 12.

 

12.3 Relinquishment
of Interest by Non-Drilling Party. When any Drilling, Deepening,
Plugging Back, or  Completion operation is conducted otherwise than for the account
of all Parties entitled to participate therein, each Non-Drilling Party, upon  the
commencement of such  operation, shall  be
deemed to have relinquished to the Drilling Party, and the Drilling Party shall own,
all such Non-

ROCKY MOUNTAIN UNIT OPERATING AGREEMENT

Form 2 (Divided Interest)'

February, 1980 (Page 10 Revised 1985)

 

Drilling Party's operating rights and
working interest in and to the well with respect to which such operation was conducted.
In the case of a
Deepening or Plugging Back operation,
if a Non-Drilling Party in such operation owned an interest in the well immediately prior to the Deepening
or Plugging Back, then the Drilling Party
for that operation shall pay to
such Non-Drilling Party its share of
the Salvage Value of the well, such
payment to be made at the time the well is taken over by the Drilling Party for Deepening
or Plugging Back.

 

12.4 Reversion
of Relinquished Interest. If,
as a result of any Drilling, Deepening,
Plugging Back, or Completion operation conducted otherwise than for the account
of all Parties entitled
to participate therein, a well
is completed as a producer of unitized
substances and is a
Development Well or results in the
establishment or enlargement of
a participating area to include  such well and if, by reason thereof, there is
included in such participating area any land  within
the Drilling Block in which a Non-Drilling Party owns a
Committed Working Interest, then
the operating rights and working interest relinquished by
such Non-Drilling Party shall revert to
it at such time as the proceeds or market value of
that portion of the Production
obtained from  the well after such relinquishment
which is allocated to all the acreage of such Non-Drilling Party in the participating area involved (after deducting from
such proceeds or market value  all Lease
 Burden and all taxes upon or measured by Production that are payable up to such time
on said portion of the Production from such well) shall equal the 
total of the  following:

 

A. 100% of
that portion of the Costs incurred in Equipping
the well and in operating the well after such relinquishment, and up
to such time, that would have been
charged to such Non-Drilling Party had the well been Drilled, Deepened, Plugged Back,
 or Completed and Equipped for the account of all Parties
entitled to participate therein.

 

B.  300%
of that portion of the Costs  incurred in Drilling, Deepening, Plugging Back, or Completing
the well that would have been charged to such Non-Drilling Party had the well been
Drilled, Deepened, Plugged back, or Completed
and Equipped for the account of all Parties entitled to participate
therein.

 

However, if a Deepening or Plugging
 Back operation is involved, then  (1) any
 payment made to such Non-Drilling Party as its share of the Salvage
Value of the well in accordance  with
Section 12.3 shall be added to and deemed part of the Costs incurred in operating
the well, for the purposes of Subdivision A above, and (2) if
such Non-Drilling Party did not participate in the initial Drilling
of the  well, but the Drilling
Party did participate therein,
and if the interest relinquished by such Non-Drilling Party upon the initial
Drilling of the well had not reverted to
it before such Deepening or Plugging Back,
then, for the purposes of Subdivision B
above, (i) where a Plugging Back is involved, there shall be added to and deemed
part of the  Costs  incurred in such Plugging
Back  the  then unrecovered portion of the
 Costs incurred in the initial Drilling of the
well down to the  pool or zone in which
such well is completed as a producer of unitized substances as  a 
result of such Plugging Back, and (ii) where a Deepening is involved, there shall be added to and 
deemed part of the  Costs  incurred
in such Deepening the then unrecovered portion of the  Costs incurred in the 
initial Drilling of the well.

 

12.5 Effect of
Reversion. From and after reversion to a Non-Drilling Party of its relinquished interest
in a well, such Non-Drilling Party shall
share, on an Acreage Basis, in the ownership
of the well, the operating rights and working interests therein, the materials and equipment
in or pertaining to the well, the Production therefrom, and the Costs of operating the well.

 

12.6 Rights and
Obligations of Drilling Party. The Drilling Party for whom a well  is Drilled, Deepened,
Plugged Back, or Completed shall pay and bear all Costs incurred therein and shall
own the well and the materials and  equipment in the well or pertaining thereto,
subject to reversion to each Non-Drilling Party of its relinquished interest in the well. If the well is
a Development Well
or results in the establishment or
enlargement of a participating
area to include the well, then, until  reversion
to a Non-Drilling Party  of its relinquished interest, the Drilling Party shall
own that portion of the Production obtained from the well after such relinquishment
which is allocated to all the acreage of such Non-Drilling Party in the participating
area involved and shall pay and bear (a) that portion of the Costs incurred in operating
the well that  otherwise would be
chargeable to such Non-Drilling Party and
(b) all Lease Burdens that  are payable with respect to that
portion of the Production from such well which is allocated to the acreage of
such Non-Drilling Party. If the Drilling Party includes two or more Parties,
the burdens imposed upon and the benefits accruing to
the Drilling Party shall be shared by
such Parties on an Acreage Basis among themselves.

 

12.7 Accounting
Due Non-Drilling Party. In  the event a relinquishment of interest by a Non Drilling
Party occurs pursuant to any provision  of this Agreement with respect 
to any well and Production is had from such well, Unit Operator shall furnish
each Non-Drilling Party, upon its request, all information referred to in Subdivision F of
Section 16.1 and, in addition, the  following:

 

A. an itemized
statement of the Costs of the operation
in which the Non-Drilling Party did not participate; and

 

B. until 
reversion occurs, a monthly itemized statement of the Costs incurred
in operating said well, the quantity of Production obtained therefrom, the
proceeds received from the  sale of such
Production, and  the Lease  Burdens paid
with respect thereto.

 

12.8 Stand-By Rig
Time. Stand-by time for the rig on a well for the period of time allowed for the initiation
of a proposal and for the response thereto shall be charged and borne as  part of the
 Costs incurred in the operation just completed. Stand-by time subsequent to said period
of time shall be charged to and borne as Costs incurred in the proposed operation, unless
no Party elected to participate
therein.

ARTICLE 13

ADJUSTMENT
ON ESTABLISHMENT OR CHANGE OF PARTICIPATING AREA

 

13.1 When Adjustment
l\lade. Whenever, in accordance with the Unit Agreement,
a participating area IS established, or revised by
contraction or enlargement, and
whenever two or more participating areas are combined (the participating area  resulting
from such establishment, revision, or combination being hereinafter
referred to as a "resulting area"),
an adjustment shall be made in accordance
with the succeeding provisions of this Article 13, as of the date on which the establishment revision or combination
that creates such resulting area becomes effective, such date  being hereinafter
referred to as the "effective date" of such resulting area. For the purposes of
this Article 13, all Costs of a usable well shall be deemed to have been incurred on the date the well was Completed.

 

13.2 Definitions.
As used in this Article 13:

 

A. 
"Usable well"  within a resulting area means a well which 
is either (1) completed in and capable of producing unitized substances from a  pool
or zone for which the resulting area was created or (2) used as a
disposal well, injection well, or otherwise in connection with the production
of unitized substances from such resulting area.

 

B. "Intangible
value" of a usable well within
a resulting area  means the amount of those
Costs incurred in Drilling, Completing, and Equipping such well, down to the 
deepest pool or zone for which such resulting area was created, which contribute
to the production of unitized substances therefrom and which are properly classified as intangible costs in 
conformity with accounting practices  generally
accepted in the industry, reduced at the following rates
for each month during any  part of which such well was operated prior to the
effective date of such resulting area:

 

(1)  .5 %
per month for a cumulative total of  60  months,
and

 

(2) NONE%
per month for each month in excess of said cumulative
total.

 

C. "Tangible
property" serving a resulting area 
means any kind of tangible property (whether or not in or pertaining to a well)
which has been acquired for use in or in connection with the production of unitized substances from such resulting
area or any  portion thereof, and the cost of which has been charged as Costs
 pursuant to this Agreement.

 

D. 
"Value" of tangible property means the amount of
Costs incurred in the construction or installation thereof (except installation costs properly classified as part of the
intangible costs incurred in connection with  a well), reduced, in the case of tangible
property which is generally regarded as depreciable, at the rate of  .50 % per
month for each month during any part  of which such well has 
been operated prior  to the  effective
date of such resulting area.

 

13.3 Method of
Adjustment on Establishment or Enlargement.
As promptly as reasonably possible  after the effective date of a resulting
area created by the establishment or  enlargement of a participating area, and as of
such effective date, an adjustment shall be made in accordance with  the following
provisions, except to the extent otherwise specified in Section 13.6:

A. The intangible
value of each usable well within such resulting area on the effective date thereof
shall be credited to the Party or
Parties owning such well immediately prior to
such effective date, in proportion to their respective interests in such well immediately
prior to such effective date. The total amount
so credited as the intangible value
of usable wells shall be charged to all Parties within the resulting area on an Acreage
Basis.

 

B. 
The value of each item of tangible
property serving the resulting
area  on the effective date thereof shall be credited 
to the Party or Parties owning such item immediately prior to such effective date, in proportion to their respective interests
in such item immediately prior to such effective date. The total amount so
credited as the value of the tangible property shall be charged to all Parties
within the resulting area on an Acreage Basis.

 

C. If
a resulting area, on the effective date thereof, is
served by any tangible property or usable well which also serves another participating
area or other participating areas, the  value of
such tangible property and usable well (including the intangible value thereof
shall be determined in accordance with Subdivision D of
Section 13.2, and such value shall be fairly 
apportioned between such resulting area  and such other participating
area or areas, provided that such apportionment receives the Approval of the
Parties in each participating area  concerned.
That portion of the value of such tangible property and usable well (including the
intangible value thereof) which is so apportioned to the resulting
area shall  be included in the adjustment
made as of the effective date of such resulting area in the same manner as is  the
value of tangible property serving only the resulting area.

 

D. The credits
and charges above provided for shall be
made by Unit Operator in such manner that an adjustment
shall be made for the intangible value of usable wells separate and apart from
an adjustment for the value of tangible
property. On each such adjustment, each Party who
is charged an amount in excess of the 
amount credited to it shall pay to Unit Operator the  amount of
such excess, which shall be  considered 
as Costs chargeable to  such Party for all purposes of this Agreement;
and such amount, when received by Unit  Operator, shall be
distributed or credited to the Parties who, in such adjustment,
are credited with amounts in excess
of the amounts charged to them respectively.

 

13.4 Method of
Adjustment on Contraction. As promptly as reasonably
possible after the effective date of a
contraction of a participating area, an adjustment shall be made with each Party owning a

 

11

 

ROCKY MOUNTAIN UNIT OPERATINGAGREEMENT

Form 2 (Divided Interest)

February. 1980

 

 

Committed Working
Interest in land excluded from  the  participating
area by such contraction (such Committed Working Interest being hereinafter in  this
Section referred to as "excluded interest") in accordance with the  following
provisions:

 

A. An adjustment
for intangibles shall be made in  accordance with Subdivision B of this Section 13.4,
and a separate adjustment
for tangibles shall be made in accordance with Subdivision C of this Section
13.4.

 

B. Such Party shall
be credited with the sum of (1) the total amount theretofore charged against such Party
with respect  to its excluded interest, pursuant
to the provisions of Exhibit 1,
as intangible Costs incurred in the development and  operation
of the participating area prior
 to the effective date of such contraction,
plus (2) the total amount charged against
such Party with respect to such excluded interest as intangible value 
of usable wells in any previous  adjustment or adjustments
made upon the establishment or revision of such participating area.
Such Party shall be charged with the sum of (1) the market value of that portion
of the Production from such participating area  which, prior to the effective date of
such contraction, was delivered to such
Party with respect  to such excluded interest,
less the amount of Lease Burdens
and taxes  paid or payable on said portion, plus 
(2) the total amount credited to such Party with respect to such excluded interest
as intangible value of usable
wells in any previous adjustment or adjustments
made upon the establishment or revision of such participating area.
Any difference between the amount of said credit and the amount of said charge
shall be adjusted as hereinafter provided.

 

C. Such Party shall
be credited with the sum of (1) the total amount theretofore charged against such Party with
respect to its excluded interest, pursuant to the provisions
of Exhibit 1, as Costs other than
intangible Costs incurred in the development and operation of
the  participating area prior to the effective date of
such contraction, plus (2) the total  amount
charged against such Party with
respect to its excluded interest as value
of tangible property in any previous 
adjustment or adjustments made upon  the 
establishment or revision of such participating area, plus (3) the excess, if
any, of the credit provided for in Subdivision
B of this Section 13.4 over the charge provided for in said Subdivision B.
Such Party shall be
charged with the sum of(l) the excess, if any, of the charge provided for in
said Subdivision B over the credit therein provided for, plus (2) the total amount credited
to such Party with respect 
to its excluded interest as value of tangible
property in any previous adjustment or adjustments made upon the establishment or revision
of such participating area.

 

D. If
the charge provided for in Subdivision
C of this Section 13.4 is equal to or
greater than the credit therein
provided for, no adjustment shall be made with such Party. However, if the credit provided for in said Subdivision
C is in excess of the charge therein provided for,
such excess shall be charged on an Acreage Basis  against Parties who remain
in the participating area after such contraction and shall be paid by
said Parties to Unit Operator upon receipt of invoices therefor. Such payments,
when received by Unit Operator, shall be paid by it to the Party owning such excluded
interest.

 

13.5 Ownership
of Wells and Tangible Property. From  and
after the effective  date of a resulting area,
all usable wells within such resulting
area and all tangible property serving
such  resulting area shall be owned by
the Parties within such area on an Acreage Basis, except that (a)
in the case of tangible property serving
a participating area or participating
areas in addition to the resulting area,
only that undivided interest therein which is proportionate to that portion of
the value thereof which is included in the adjustment provided for shall be owned by the Parties within the resulting
area on an Acreage Basis, and (b) if a Party
within the resulting area was a Non-Drilling Party for a well which is a usable
well within such resulting area on the effective date thereof, and if the relinquished interest
of such Non-Drilling Party in such well has not reverted to it prior to
such effective date, the Drilling Party for such well shall own the interest
therein that would otherwise be
owned by such Non-Drilling Party until
reversion to such Non-Drilling Party of its relinquished
interest in such  well.

 

13.6 Relinquished
Interest of Non-Drilling Parties. If the interest relinquished by
a Non-Drilling Party in a well which  is a usable well within a resulting area
on the  effective date thereof has not reverted to it prior to such effective date,
then insofar, but only insofar, as they  relate
to such well, the adjustments provided !'or in Section 13.3 shall be
subject  to the following provisions, wherein
the sum of the  intangible value of such well, plus the 
value of the tangible property in or pertaining thereto, is referred to as the  "value"
of such well:

 

A. The Drilling
Party for such well shall be
charged with that part of the value of
the well that would otherwise be chargeable to such Non-Drilling Party with
 respect to (1) such Non-Drilling Party's Committed
Working Interest or Interests in the  participating
area in which  the  well was Drilled, as
such participating area existed when the Drilling of
the well was commenced, if the well was Drilled as a Development Well, or (2)
the  Committed Working Interest or Interests of such Non-Drilling Party which entitled
it to participate in the Drilling, Deepening, Plugging Back, or Completion
of the well, if it was Drilled,
Deepened, Plugged Back, or Completed  otherwise
than as a Development Well. However, such Non-Drilling Party shall 
be charged  with such part, 
if any, of the value of such 
well as is chargeable to it, in accordance with Subdivisions A
and B of Section  13.3, with
respect  to its Committed Working Interests
other than those referred to in ( 1) and (2) above.

 

B. If that part
 of the value of
such well which would have  been credited to such Non-Drilling Party if the
well had been Drilled, Deepened, Plugged Back, or Completed for the account of all Parties
entitled to participate therein exceeds
the amount provided in Subdivison A of this Section.

 

13.6 to be
charged against the Drilling Party, such excess shall be
applied against the reimbursement

to which the Drilling
Party is entitled out of Production that would otherwise
accrue to such Non-Drilling Party. Any balance of such excess over the amount necessary
to complete such reimbursement shall be credited to such Non-Drilling Party.

 

ARTICLE 14

SUPERVISION OF OPERATIONS BY PARTIES

 

14.1 Right of
Supervision. Each operation conducted by Unit Operator
under this Agreement or the Unit Agreement shall be
subject to supervision and control
in accordance with the succeeding provisions of this Article 14 by the Parties who
are chargeable with the Costs thereof.

 

14.2
Voting Control. In the supervision of an operation conducted by Unit Operator, the
Parties chargeable with the Costs of such operation
shall have the right to vote in proportion to their respective obligations for such
Costs. The Parties having the right to vote on any other matter shall vote thereon
on an Acreage Basis. Except as provided for in the Unit Agreement and except as otherwise
specified in this Agreement (particular reference being made to Section 25.1, Section 27.1, and that portion of
Section 11.5 relating to abandonment of producing wells outside of

so long as, performance
thereof is prevented by
fire, action of the elements, strikes or
other differences with workmen,  acts
of civil or military authorities, acts
of the public enemy, restrictions or restraints imposed by
law or by regulation or order of
governmental authority, whether Federal,
State, or local, inability to
obtain necessary rights of access, or any
other cause reasonably beyond the control of Unit Operator, whether or not similar
to any cause above enumerated. Whenever performance of its obligations is prevented

payment of Costs chargeable to it, Unit Operator shall have the right to collect  and
receive proceeds from the purchaser of such Party's share of Production,

shall be made monthly between such advances and
Costs, to the end that each Party shall bear and pay its proportionate share
of Costs incurred and no more. Unit Operator
may request advance payment or security
for the total estimated Costs to
be incurred in a particular Drilling, Deepening, Plugging Back, or Completing
operation and, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, shall not be obligated to
commence such operation unless and until  such advance 
payment is made or Unit Operator is furnished security acceptable to it for
such  payment by the Party or Parties chargeable
therewith.

 

15.7 Use of Unit
Operator's Drilling Equipment. Any Drilling, Deepening, or Plugging  Back operation
conducted hereunder may be conducted by Unit Operator with its own tools and equipment, provided that
the rates to be charged and the applicable
terms  and conditions are set forth in a form of drilling
contract which receives the Approval of the Party
or Parties chargeable with the Costs of such operation,
except that in any case where Unit  Operator
alone constitutes the Drilling Party, such
form shall receive the Approval of the Parties
within the participating area or other designated area for such well prior 
to the commencement of such operation.

 

15.8 Rights as
Party. As an owner of a Committed Working Interest,
the Party acting as Unit Operator shall have the same rights and obligations
hereunder as if it were not Unit Operator. In each instance
where this Agreement requires or permits

the titles to all lands  within
the Drilling Block (if one has
 been established) or within the title examination area (in all other instances).

Titles Prior to Inclusion
of Land in a Participating Area. Where the Committed Working Interests within a participating area are owned by more than
one Party, no Committed Working Interest shall be included within said participating

completed otherwise than as a producer  of unitized substances in Paying Quantities,
or if title to a Committed Working Interest which has received the Approval of
the Parties under Section 18.6 fails in whole or in part 
at a time when the tract affected thereby is
within a participating area, then:

 

A. the loss,
the cost of litigation, and any

Drilling Block (including the Party
whose Committed Working  Interest has
been lost and including the acreage of
such Committed Working  Interest);

 

B. there shall
be relinquished to the Party whose Committed Working  Interest
has been lost such proportionate part  of
each of the 0ther Committed Working Interests
in the lands within such affected participating area or Drilling Block, subject

Working Interest a joint loss of
the  Parties within such participating area or Drilling
Block; and

 

C the relinquished
portions of said Committed Working Interests (subject to
their proportionate part  of the
Lease Burdens attributable thereto) shall be deemed owned by the Party receiving same.

ARTICLE 24

SEPARATE MEASUREMENT AND SALVAGE

 

24.1
Separate Measurement. If a well completed as a  producer of unitized substances
is in or becomes included in a participating area but is not owned on an Acreage Basis by
all the Parties within such participating area 
and if, within thirty (30) days after request therefor
by any interested Party, a method  of
measuring the Production from such well
without the necessity of additional facilities does not receive the Approval of
the Parties, then Unit Operator shall install
such additional tankage, flow lines, or
other facilities for separate measurement
of the unitized  substances produced
from such well as Unit Operator may deem suitable. The Costs of such facilities for separate measurement shall be charged to
and borne by the Drilling Party for
such well and treated as Costs incurred in operating
such well, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement.

 

24.2 Salvaged Materials.
If any materials or equipment are salvaged from a well completed as a producer after
being Drilled,  Deepened, Plugged Back, or Completed 
otherwise than for the account of all the 
Parties entitled to participate therein before reversion to the Non-Drilling Party of its relinquished interest
in the well, the proceeds derived  from the sale thereof or, if
not sold, the Salvage Value thereof, shall be treated in the same manner
as proceeds of Production from
such well for the purpose of determining reversion to the 
Non-Drilling Party of its relinquished interest in such well.

 

ARTICLE 25

ENHANCED RECOVERY AND PRESSURE MAINTENANCE

 

25.1 Consent Required.
Unit Operator shall not undertake any
program of enhanced recovery or pressure maintenance
involving injection of gas, water, or other
substance by any method, whether now known
or hereafter devised, without first obtaining the consent of
Parties owning, on an Acreage Basis, not less than  90 % of the Committed
Working Interests in the participating area
affected by any such program. After the Parties have voted to undertake a program of enhanced
recovery or pressure maintenance in accordance
with this Section 25.1, the conduct of such program shall be subject to supervision
by the Parties as set forth in Article 14.

 

25.2 Above-Ground
 Facilities. This Agreement shall not be deemed to 
require any Party  to participate in the 
construction or operation of any gasoline plant, sulphur recovery plant, dewaxing
plant, or other above-ground  facilities

other than such facilities as may be required for treating Production in ordinary lease operations and such facilities
as may  be required in the conduct  of
operations authorized under Section 25.1.

 

ARTICLE 26

26.1 Sale by Unit
Operator. If Unit Operator sells all its Committed Working Interests, it shall resign
and a new Unit Operator shall be selected as provided  in the Unit Agreement.

 

26.2 Assumption
of Obligations. No transfer
of any Committed Working Interest shall be
effective unless the same is made expressly subject to
the Unit Agreement and this Agreement and the transferee agrees in writing to
assume and perform all obligations of the transferor under the Unit Agreement and this Agreement insofar as they relate
to the interest assigned, except that such  assumption
of obligations  shall  not be required in
case of a transfer by mortgage or deed
of trust as security for indebtedness.

 

26.3 Effective
Date. A transfer of Committed
Working Interests shall not be effective as among the Parties until the first
day of the month next following the delivery to Unit Operator of
the original or a certified copy of the
instrument of transfer conforming to the
requirements of Section 26.2. In no event shall a transfer of Committed Working Interests
relieve the transferring Party of any obligations accrued  under this Agreement
prior to said effective date, for which purpose any obligation
assumed by the transferor to participate
in the Drilling, Deepening, Plugging Back, or Completing
of a well prior to such  effective date 
shall be deemed  an accrued obligation.

 

ARTICLE 27

RELEASE FROM OBLIGATIONS AND
SURRENDER

 

27.1 Surrender
or Release Within Participating Area.  A Committed Working Interest in land within
a participating area shall not be
surrendered except with the consent of
all Parties within such participating area. However, a Party who owns a Committed
 Working Interest in land within a participating area and who is not 
at the time committed to participate in  the 
Drilling,  Deepening, Plugging Back, or Completing of a well within such participating
area may be relieved of further obligations with 
respect to such participating area, as then constituted, by
executing and delivering to Unit  Operator
an assignment conveying to all other Parties
within  such participating area all Commit ted Working 
Interests owned by such Party in lands within the participating area, together
with  the

 

19

 

 

ROCKY MOUNTAIN UNIT OPERATING AGREEMENT

Form 2 (Divided Interest)

February, 1980

 

entire
interest of such Party in any and
21l wells, materials, equipment, and other property within or pertaining to such participating
area.

 

27.2 Procedure
on Surrender or Release Outside Participating Area. Whenever a
Party  or Parties owning 100% of
the Committed Working Interest in any tract which is not within any participating area
desire to surrender said 100% interest,
such Party or Parties shall give to
all other Parties notice thereof, describing such Committed Working  Interest.
The Parties receiving  such notice, or
any of them, shall have the right  at their option to take from the Party
or Parties desiring to surrender an
assignment of such Committed Working Interest
by giving the Party or Parties
desiring to surrender notice of
election so to do
within thirty (30) days after receipt
of notice of the desire to surrender. If such election is
made as above provided, the Party  or Parties taking
the assignment (which shall be taken 
by them in proportion to the acreage of
their respective Committed Working Interests among themselves
in the Unit Area) shall  pay the assigning
Party  or Parties for its or their
 share of the Salvage
Value of all wells, if any, in which the assigning Party
or Parties own an interest and
which are located on the land covered by such Committed Working Interest, which payment
shall be made upon receipt of the
assignment. If no
Party elects to take such assignment within
said thirty (30) day period, then the Party
or Parties owning such Committed Working Interest may surrender the same, if
surrender thereof can be made in accordance
with the Unit Agreement. Whenever a Party  owning
less than 100% of the Committed Working Interest in any tract desires to
surrender its interest therein, such
interest may be acquired by
the other Party or Parties owning Committed Working Interests in said tract without notice being 
given to any  other Parties owning interests
within  the Unit Area. In the event the other Party or Parties owning Committed
Working Interests in the tract to be surrendered
do not desire to acquire such interest, the interest shall be treated as a 100% interest.

 

27.3 Accrued Obligations.
A Party making an assignment
or surrender in accordance with Section 27.1
or Section 27.2 shall not be
relieved of its liability for
any obligation accrued under this Agreement at the time the 
assignment or surrender is made or of the obligation to bear its share of the Costs incurred in any Drilling,
Deepening, Plugging Back, or Completing
operation in which such Party had elected to participate prior to
the making of such assignment or
surrender, except to the extent that the
Party or Parties receiving such assignment
shall  assume, with the Approval
of the Parties, any and all obligations
of the assigning Party under this Agreement and under the Unit Agreement.

computation of partnership taxable income.  If the 
income tax laws of the State or States in which the Unit Area is located contain,
 or hereafter contain,
provisions similar to those contained
in the Subchapter of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 above referred to under which
a similar election is permitted, each of the Parties agrees that such election shall
be exercised; and should the income tax laws of such State or States require evidence of such election, 
Unit Operator is authorized
and directed  to execute the same on behalf of each Party. Beginning with the
first taxable year of operation under this Agreement, each Party agrees that 
the deemed election provided by Federal Regulations Section 1.761-2(b)(2)(ii) will apply, and no Party will file an 
application under Federal Regulations Section 1.761·2(b)(3)(i) to revoke said election. *See Page 22.

ARTICLE 37

OTHER PROVISIONS

 

 

37.1	PAYMENT
OF TAXES RELATING TO PRODUCTION.

 

	A. At
and during such time, or times, as Non-Operator is exercising the
right to take in kind or separately dispose of its proportionate part of the production as set forth in Paragraph 6.4 hereof,
Non-Operator shall pay, or arrange for the payment of, all production, severance,  gathering,
sales or similar taxes imposed upon such part.

 

	B. At
and during such time, or times, as Unit Operator is selling Non-Operator's proportionate part of the production,
as set forth m Paragraph 6.5 hereof, Unit Operator shall pay, or arrange for
the payment of, all production, severance, gathering, sales or similar taxes imposed
upon such part.

 

37.2 
NON-CONSENT INVESTMENT ADJUSTMENT.  Notwithstanding any provision in this
Agreement to the contrary, no Party shall be liable, without its consent, for any investment adjustment charge under the provisions
of Section 13.3D or 13.4D, which charge is in excess of the Party's credits under Article
13. In the event of the establishment, enlargement or contraction of a
Participating Area, the provisions of Article 12, and other provisions related thereto, shall be applicable to
any investment adjustment to the same extent that these provisions are applicable to a well drilled otherwise than for the
account of all Parties entitled to participate therein. Any Party subject to such charge
may elect not to pay it in cash. If, within 30 days after proposal for establishment, enlargement or con
traction of a Participating Area has been submitted by Unit Operator in writing to the Working Interest Owners involved,
a Party elects not to participate in the investment adjustment applicable  to the establishment,
enlargement or contraction,  that Party shall be a
Non-Drilling Party, and shall be deemed, as of the effective date of the resulting
area in connection with which such  charge is
made,  to have relinquished the
interest for which such charge is made to the Party, or Parties, who would otherwise
be entitled to receive a credit under Section 13.3D or Section 13.4D,  which latter
Party, or Parties, shall be the Drilling Party with respect to this relinquished interest. The Drilling Party shall own the relinquished
interest until it reverts to Non-Drilling Party pursuant to Article 12, except that it is specifically understood that the Article
12.4B percentage for exercise of the Non-Drilling Option applicable to establishment, enlargement or contraction of the Participating
Area be 300%.

 

28.3 TAX ELECTION.
(Continued) This election by the Parities to be excluded from the application of  all
of the provisions of  Subchapter K does not  apply
in any way to any subsequent agreements between the Parties, or with third parties, concerning the sharing of costs for the drilling
of any wells in the Unit Area.  The Parties reserve the right to decide with each such
subsequent agreement whether they elect to be excluded from the application of Subchapter K.

payments which may fall due under this lease  may be made to  

one of the above
named  lessor, in the manner herein stated.

17.

lease production on the leased premises shall cease from any cause, this lease shall not 
terminate provided operations  for the drilling of 
a well sha11 be commenced before  or on the next ensuing rental 
paying date: or, provided lessee begins or  resumes the payment of rentals in
the manner and amount hereinbefore provided. If, after
the expiration  of  the primary 
term of this lease, production  on the leased premises shall cease from any
cause, this  lease shall not terminate provided lessee resumes operations 
for drilling a well within sixty (60) days  from such cessation, and this lease
shall remain in force during the prosecution of  such operations 
and. if production results therefrom, then as long as production continues.

be subject to all  federal and state laws, 
executive  orders, rules and regulations, and 
this  lease shall not be terminated, in whole 
or  in  part, nor lessee held liable

of any such law, order, rule or regulation,  or 
if such compliance is  prevented by or 
failure is the result of inability of lessee through no fault of its own, to obtain sufficient and satisfactory material
and equipment to justify  the commencement of drilling operations or to continue production
 of oil or gas from the leased premises.

20. This
lease  and  all its terms, conditions,
and stipulations shall extend to and be binding on al1 successors of said  lessor or
lessee.

to all provisions of the "Paradise Unit Agreement", operations for the Paradise Unit shall be conducted pursuant to the
Unit Operating Agreement, attached hereto as Exhibit "D", except that with respect to
any inconsistencies between this Agreement and the Unit Operating Agreement, this Agreement shall govern. If additional
Paradise Unit wells are proposed subsequent to the drilling, completion and/or abandonment or
the Empire Paradise Unit No. 2-12 Well, then such additional wells shall be drilled pursuant to the terms and provisions
of the Unit Operating Agreement.

 

V. AREA OF MUTUAL INTEREST

 

Empire
and the Cortez Group hereby form an area of mutual interest ("AMI") covering Townships 11, 12, 13 and 14 North and Ranges
34, 35 and 36 East MDM, Nevada.  This AMI shall remain in effect for five (5) years
from the date of this Agreement.


     
     
    

If
during the five (5) year duration of such AMI
any party should acquire ("Acquiring Party") any 
oil and gas leases, leasehold interest or mineral  interest within the AMI by
any means including, but not limited to, purchase, top lease, farmins, farmouts, farmout options, or acreage contributions, then
the  Acquiring Party  shall immediately
notify the Non-Acquiring Parties, in writing, of such acquisition, setting forth the nature of the interest acquired, all terms,
provisions and contracts related to the acquisition (along with copies of all documents relating to the acquisitions or rights
to earn a leasehold or mineral interest) and the price paid therefor. The Non-Acquiring Parties shall have a period of thirty (30)
days following receipt of notice to elect in writing, with all appropriate documentation relating to the acquisition, to purchase
at the Acquiring Party's cost and acquire its Ownership Percentage (defined below) of
such acquisition by remitting the required payment to the Acquiring Party, during such thirty (30) day period. If the interest
is to be earned by drilling and/or shooting seismic, the Non-Acquiring Parties must ratify all appropriate agreements within the
thirty (30) days period. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, such thirty (30) day notice period may be reduced due to applicable
contractual obligations or limitations  (e.g., farmout terms or lease expiration dates),
in which case the Non-Acquiring Parties may be required to respond in a shorter time period as may be reasonably appropriate under
the circumstances. In the event one or more parties receiving an offer pursuant to this paragraph 
do not accept same, the Acquiring  Party shall first offer the interest not accepted
by a party to the other parties on a pro rata basis. If any of the interest that was previously turned down by a party is 
available after it has been turned down by the remaining parties, the Acquiring Party shall hold such interest free and
clear of any further AMI obligations of this Agreement. However,  notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein, any interest within the AMI acquired by any party as a result of the acquisition of the stock
or substantially all of the assets of another entity or any transaction in which such interests are not of material value in relation
to the entire transaction, shall be excluded  from and not subject to this AMI.

 

The
parties specifically agree that if a lease or interest
covers land both inside and outside an AMI, the Acquiring Party must offer the entire lease or interest to the other parties and
if the party elects to acquire an interest in the lease, it must agree to proportionately
acquire an interest in the entire lease or interest even if a
portion of the lease
or interest lies outside the AMI.

 

Any interest acquired within the AMI shall 
be subject to the  provisions of the Unit

Operating Agreement, or Joint Operating Agreement,
as applicable.

 

As
used herein, "Ownership Percentage" shall be the same percentage as the parties' then-ownership in the Paradise Unit.
To the extent the parties'  then-ownership in the Paradise Unit is not uniform throughout
the Unit, then Ownership Percentage shall be the average of each party's ownership interest on an
acreage basis.
