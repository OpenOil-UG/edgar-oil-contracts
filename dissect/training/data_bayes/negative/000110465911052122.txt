ARTICLE XI
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND COMPANY PROPERTY
 
11.1                        The Executive acknowledges that the Executive will acquire Confidential Information (defined below) concerning the business and operations of the Company, the use or disclosure of which would cause the Company substantial loss and damages that could not readily be calculated and for which no remedy at law would be adequate.  Accordingly, the Executive agrees and undertakes that during the Term of this Agreement,  and following the termination of the Agreement for any reason, the Executive shall:
 
6






 
(a)                                  treat confidentially all Confidential Information belonging to the Company; and
 
(b)                                 shall not use or disclose the Confidential Information to any third party, except for the purpose of carrying out his duties under this Agreement.
 
As used herein, Confidential Information includes, without limitation, information with respect to the Companys assets and facilities, seismic data, well logs, trade secrets and other intellectual property, patents and patent applications, systems, procedures, manuals, drilling reports, acreage positions, exploration prospects, reserve reports, reserve information, financial information, business plans, prospects or opportunities, and related information; provided however, that such term shall not include information that (i) is or becomes generally known or publicly available other than as a result of disclosure by the Executive, or (ii) is acquired by the Executive from a third party, which third party was not under a confidentiality obligation to the Company.
 
Upon the termination of the Executives employment with the Company for any reason, the Executive will deliver to the Company any and all property belonging to the Company or its clients, including, without limitation, all records, data, notes, reports, proposals, client lists, correspondence, materials, equipment or other documents or property, and any copies or reproductions thereof (hereinafter collectively referred to as the Company Property), which may have come into the Executives possession during the course of his employment.
 
ARTICLE XII
NON-SOLICITATION
 
12.1                        The Executive acknowledges and agrees that in performing the duties and responsibilities of his employment as outlined in this Agreement, he will occupy a position of high fiduciary trust and confidence, pursuant to which he will develop and acquire wide experience and knowledge with respect to all aspects of the business carried on by the Corporation and its affiliates, and the manner in which such business is conducted.  It is the expressed intent and agreement of the Executive and the Corporation that such knowledge and experience shall be used solely and exclusively in furtherance of the business interests of the Corporation and such affiliates, and not in any manner detrimental to them.  The Executive therefore agrees that, so long as he is employed by the Corporation pursuant to this Agreement, he shall not engage in any
 
7






 
practice or business that competes with the business of the Corporation anywhere where the Corporation does business.
 
12.2                        The Executive acknowledges and agrees that should he leave the employ of the Corporation and compete against the Corporation, the Corporation shall suffer damage such as loss of investment and loss of potential profits.  In addition, the Corporation shall be irreparably harmed which harm cannot be adequately compensated in damages.  The Executive therefore covenants and agrees that for a period of one (1) year after the Executive ceases to be an employee of the Corporation for any reason whatsoever, the Executive shall not, without prior written consent of the Corporation:
 
(a)                                solicit or entice, or attempt to solicit or entice, either directly or indirectly, any employee of the Corporation as at the date of termination of the Executives employment with the Corporation to become employed by or connected with any business or enterprise which competes with the Corporation; or
 
(b)                                 use, for the Executives own purpose, or for any purposes other than those of the Corporation, any information and technology, which the Executive may have acquired or may in the future acquire in relation to the business or affairs of the Corporation or any of its clients.
