the parties agree as follows:


     Section 1. Definitions. Unless otherwise defined in this Amendment, each capitalized term
used in this Amendment has the meaning assigned to such term in the Credit Agreement.


     Section 2. Amendment of Credit Agreement.


          (a) Section 1.1 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by adding the following new defined
terms in their appropriate alphabetical order:



 2011 Senior Notes means those certain senior unsecured notes

issuer, and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, and

entered into in connection therewith pursuant to which the 2011 Senior Notes
were issued, as the same may be amended, restated, modified or supplemented
from time to time.


          (b) Section 1.1 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by replacing the following defined
terms in their entirety with the following:



 Indenture Debt Documents means, individually and collectively,
(i) the 2009 Senior Notes Indenture, (ii) the 2011 Senior Notes Indenture,
(iii) any Permitted Additional Notes Indenture and (iv) any documents
related to or delivered in connection with the issuance of any Permitted
Refinancing Indebtedness.



 Permitted Additional Notes means senior unsecured notes issued
by the Borrower from time to time after October 31, 2011; provided that (a)
the final maturity date of such senior unsecured notes shall not be earlier
than 91 days after the Maturity Date (as in effect on the date of issuance
of such senior unsecured notes); (b) such senior unsecured notes and any
Permitted Additional Notes Indenture under which such senior unsecured notes
are issued contain customary terms and conditions for senior unsecured notes
of like tenor and amount and do not contain any covenants, events or default
or other provisions (other than interest rate


2




 




and redemption premiums) that, on the whole, are materially more onerous to
the Borrower and its Subsidiaries than those imposed by this Agreement; and
(c) at the time of and immediately after giving effect to each incurrence of
such Indebtedness, no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing.






     
     
     Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness means Indebtedness (for
purposes of this definition, new Indebtedness) incurred in exchange for,

portion refinanced, the Refinanced Indebtedness); provided that (a) such

premiums) that, on the whole, are materially more onerous to the Borrower
and its Subsidiaries than those imposed by the Refinanced Indebtedness; (d)
the stated interest or coupon rate of such new Indebtedness is reasonably
acceptable to the Administrative Agent; and (e) no Event of Default shall
exist at the time of, or result from, the issuance of such new Indebtedness.
For the avoidance of doubt, that portion of any Indebtedness initially
issued as Permitted Additional Notes the proceeds of which are used to call,
redeem or repurchase 2009 Senior Notes or 2011 Senior Notes and the
principal amount of which is ultimately deducted from the Borrowing Base
adjustment pursuant to Section 2.8(d)(ii) shall constitute Permitted
Refinancing Indebtedness.

terms: 2004 Senior Notes; and 2004 Senior Notes Indenture.


          (d) Section 2.8(d)(ii) is hereby amended by deleting the proviso and replacing it in its

of the proceeds of such Permitted Additional Notes to call, redeem or
repurchase all or a portion of the 2009 Senior Notes or 2011 Senior Notes
within thirty (30) days of the issuance of such Permitted Additional Notes
in accordance with Section 7.12(a), then the outstanding principal
amount of 2009 Senior Notes or 2011 Senior Notes to be called, redeemed or
repurchased (together with any 2009 Senior Notes and 2011 Senior Notes
previously called, redeemed or repurchased prior to or after the Closing


3




 




Date) shall be deducted from the stated aggregate principal amount of
Permitted Additional Notes for purposes of the foregoing automatic Borrowing
Base reduction; provided further that the Borrowing Base shall be
automatically reduced further by $0.25 for every $1 of the aggregate
outstanding principal amount of any 2009 Senior Notes or 2011 Senior Notes,
as applicable, that were the subject of such call, redemption or repurchase
but that have not been redeemed or repurchased on or before the last day of
such thirty (30) day period.


          (e) Section 7.3(f) is hereby deleted and replaced in its entirety with the following:



(f) unsecured Indebtedness of Borrower (and related Guaranty Obligations of
the Guarantors) outstanding under (i) the 2009 Senior Notes Indenture ,
provided that the aggregate principal amount of any Indebtedness outstanding
thereunder shall not exceed $300,000,000 at any time, (ii) the 2011 Senior
Notes, provided that the aggregate principal amount of any Indebtedness
outstanding thereunder shall not exceed $300,000,000 at any time, (iii) any
Permitted Additional Notes, provided that the aggregate principal amount of
any Indebtedness outstanding thereunder, not including any amount used to
call, redeem or repurchase 2009 Senior Notes or 2011 Senior Notes (which
shall constitute Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness) shall not exceed
$300,000,000 at any time, and (iv) any Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness


          (f) Section 7.12(a) is hereby deleted and replaced in its entirety with the following:



(a) the Borrower may call, redeem or repurchase 2009 Senior Notes or 2011
Senior Notes at any time, provided that both before and after giving
effect to any such call, redemption or repurchase no Default or Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing and the Outstanding Amount
shall not exceed, after giving effect to any Credit Extension the proceeds
of which are used (or are intended to be used) to fund any portion of any
such call, redemption or repurchase, 66.6% of the Borrowing Base then in
effect (provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Borrower acknowledges
that the Borrowing Base shall not be increased as result of any such call,
redemption or repurchase except to the extent (if any) that the principal
amount of the 2009 Senior Notes or 2011 Senior Notes redeemed or repurchased
with the proceeds of Permitted Additional Notes is netted against the
principal amount of such Permitted Additional Notes for purposes of any
reduction in the Borrowing Base pursuant to Section 2.8(d)(ii)); and


          (g) The Credit Agreement is hereby amended by deleting the existing Schedule 2.1 to the Credit
Agreement and inserting in its place the text contained in Annex II attached to this Amendment as
the new Schedule 2.1 to the Credit Agreement.
