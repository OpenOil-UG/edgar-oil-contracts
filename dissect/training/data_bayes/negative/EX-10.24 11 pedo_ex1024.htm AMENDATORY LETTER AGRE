Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated August 23, 2011

Weld County, Colorado
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
Reference is hereby made to that certain Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), dated August 23, 2011, by and among Esenjay Oil & Gas, Ltd. (“Esenjay”), Winn Exploration Co., Inc. (“Winn”), Lacy Properties, Ltd. (“Lacy”) and Crain Energy, Ltd. (“Crain”), as Sellers, and Pacific Energy Development Corp. (“PEDCO”), as Buyer, as amended by that certain Amendatory Letter Agreement (“Amendment No. 1”), dated September 30, 2011, among the Parties. Esenjay, Winn, Lacy, Crain and PEDCO are sometimes referred to herein collectively, as the “Parties” or individually, as a “Party.” This Amendatory Letter Agreement No. 2 (this “Amendment”) sets forth the terms and conditions of the agreement among the Parties with regard to the above-referenced matter. All capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Purchase Agreement.
 
The Purchase Agreement, as amended, sets forth the terms and conditions by which PEDCO agrees to acquire from Esenjay, Winn, Lacy and Crain an undivided Fifty Percent (50%) of 8/8ths interest in certain leases insofar as those leases cover certain lands identified in the Purchase Agreement.
 
Section 1.3 of the Purchase Agreement provides that Closing shall be held on or before 10:00 a.m. local time in Corpus Christi, Texas, 60 days from the execution date of the Purchase Agreement. Section 9.1(b)(iii) and Section 9.1(c)(iii) of the Purchase Agreement also reference Closing occurring at the end of this 60-day period. The end of the 60-day period falls on a weekend. Therefore, the Parties desire to amend Section 1.3, Section 9.1(b) and Section 9.1(c) of the Purchase Agreement to set the time at which Closing is to occur at 10:00 a.m. local time in Corpus Christi, Texas, four (4) business days following the date that each Party executes and delivers to Esenjay or PEDCO, as appropriate, a written certificate stating that all pre-Closing covenants and conditions precedent to Closing have been satisfied by such Party, or on such other date as mutually agreed in writing by the Parties.

Appendix 1 to the Purchase Agreement defines “Effective Date” as sixty (60) days from the execution date of the Purchase Agreement. The end of the 60-day period falls on a weekend. Therefore, the Parties desire to amend the definition of Effective Date contained in Appendix 1 to the Purchase Agreement to be the date of Closing.
 
Section 2.2 of the Purchase Agreement provides that Sellers have the right, but not the obligation, to acquire one or more Additional Leases until the expiration of the Review Period, and if so acquired, such Additional Leases will be treated in the same manner as the Appendix 2 Leases under the Purchase Agreement. Further, during the Review Period, Esenjay will notify PEDCO in writing if and when Additional Leases are acquired. Pursuant to Amendment No. 1, the Parties agreed to define “Review Period” as a period ending at 5:00 p.m. local time in Corpus Christi, Texas, Wednesday, October 5, 2011. As of the date of this Amendment, Esenjay is acquiring leases that it intends be treated as Additional Leases pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement. Therefore, the Parties desire to amend Section 2.2 of the Purchase Agreement to allow Esenjay to acquire Additional Leases beyond the expiration of the Review Period and set the time by which notice of Additional Leases is due to PEDCO from Esenjay at 5:00 p.m. local time in Corpus Christi, Texas on Friday, October 21, 2011.
 
Section 1.3(a)1 of the Purchase Agreement requires that, at Closing, PEDCO pay to each Seller such Seller’s Proportionate Share of the Purchase Price. Section 1.3(a)3 of the Purchase Agreement requires that, at Closing, PEDCO pay to Counsel to Esenjay, to hold in escrow for the benefit of Sellers for a period of forty-five (45) days following Closing, fifteen percent (15%) of the Purchase Price. Section 1.3(c) requires that, at Closing, PEDCO pay One Dollar ($1) to Esenjay for the seismic licenses referred to in Section 1.3(b) of the Purchase Agreement. The last sentence of Section 1.3 of the Purchase Agreement requires PEDCO to make all payments required under Section 1.3 of Purchase Agreement by wire transfer to accounts designated by each Seller in writing. The Parties desire to amend these sections of the Purchase Agreement to allow PEDCO to cause such payments to be made in the event PEDCO is not initiating the wire transfers.
 
The Operating Agreement is attached to the Purchase Agreement as Appendix 6. The Parties desire to modify the Operating Agreement to reflect that Condor Energy Technology LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (“Condor”), will be Operator under the Operating Agreement, that such operating agreement supersede and replace any existing operating agreement covering the Contract Area (as defined in the Operating Agreement) and that the form of operating agreement attached hereto as Exhibit A replace Appendix 6 of the Purchase Agreement.
 
Section 1.3(a)5 and Section 8.1(a) of the Purchase Agreement require that PEDCO and Esenjay execute and deliver to the other a seismic license in the form attached to the Purchase Agreement as Appendix 4. The Parties desire that Condor be the licensee under such seismic license, that Condor, rather than PEDCO, execute and deliver the seismic license, that the seismic license include a definition of the term “parent,” and that the form of seismic license attached hereto as Exhibit B replace Appendix 4 of the Purchase Agreement.

The Parties desire to identify certain consents to assignment in the Deed of Trust and to replace the Deed of Trust with the form of Mortgage, Deed of Trust, Assignment of As-extracted Collateral, Security Agreement and Financing Statement attached hereto as Exhibit C.
 
Section 1.3(a)6 and Section 8.1(b) of the Purchase Agreement require that PEDCO execute a seismic license with Geophysical Pursuit, Inc.

The Parties desire that Condor be the licensee under such seismic license and that Condor, rather than PEDCO, execute the seismic license.
