1.           Strategic, Advisory and Consulting Services.  By execution hereof, Whitebox  agrees that, during the Term (as such term is defined herein), to the extent requested by the Company and deemed appropriate by Whitebox, Whitebox shall render to the Company, by and through itself, its affiliates, and its respective officers, members, employees and representatives as Whitebox in its sole discretion shall designate from time to time, advisory and consulting services in relation to the affairs of the Company in connection with ongoing strategic and operational oversight of the Company, which may include, without limitation, (a) advice on financing structures and relationships with the Company’s lenders and bankers; (b) advice regarding public and private offerings of debt and equity securities of the Company; (c) advice regarding asset dispositions, acquisitions or other asset management strategies; (d) advice regarding potential business acquisitions, dispositions or combinations involving the Company or its affiliates, (which advice may include, by way of illustration only, identifying and evaluating candidates for acquisitions, dispositions or business combination transactions, assisting the Company in evaluating and responding to inquiries and proposals that may be received by the Company regarding potential acquisitions, dispositions or business combination transactions, assisting the Company in negotiations in respect of acquisitions, dispositions or business combination transactions and consulting with and assisting counsel and accountants in the structuring and execution of acquisitions, dispositions or business combination transactions), and (e) such other advice directly related or ancillary to the above strategic, advisory and consulting services as may be reasonably requested by the Company (any transaction or matter being the subject matter of any advice provided hereunder directly or indirectly by Whitebox being referred to herein as a “Matter”).  Except as provided in Section 3 hereof, Whitebox shall not charge a fee for the provision of strategic, advisory and consulting services set forth in clauses (a) through (e) of this Section 1.   The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Company shall rely solely on the counsel of its own attorneys regarding legal matters and shall consult with and rely solely upon the advice of its own tax advisors and other advisers regarding the tax consequences and other economic considerations with respect to any Matter.

 




  



  







  




2.           Additional Services.  In addition to the strategic, advisory and consulting services set forth in clauses (a) through (e) of Section 1 hereof, upon the request of the Company, Whitebox may also provide such additional services as may be agreed upon in writing by the Company and Whitebox and specifically set forth as an addendum to this letter agreement.  Such addendum shall set forth in reasonable detail the nature of the services to be provided and the charges associated with such services.

 

3.           Reimbursement of Expenses.  Whether or not any proposed Matter is consummated, the Company agrees to periodically reimburse Whitebox, upon request, for: (a) Whitebox’s travel and other out-of-pocket expenses, provided, however, that in the event such expenses exceed $50,000 in the aggregate with respect to any single proposed Matter, Whitebox shall first obtain the Company’s consent before incurring additional reimbursable expenses, and (b) provided the Company’s prior consent to their engagement with respect to any particular proposed Matter is obtained, all reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel, accountants and other professionals, in each case incurred in connection with Whitebox’s services under this letter agreement.  The Company agrees that, in lieu of reimbursing Whitebox for such expenses, Whitebox may forward to the Company invoices for the same, and the Company shall promptly pay such invoices directly to the payee.

 

4.           Confidentiality.  The Company acknowledges and agrees that from time to time Confidential Information of the Company has been, and in the future may be, shared between Whitebox and its Representatives and Representatives of the Company (including without limitation directors of the Company that may be otherwise affiliated with Whitebox) in connection with the provision of advice by Whitebox to the Company and such Representatives.  The parties hereby agree that such Confidential Information may continue to be shared, consistent with past practice and such sharing of information is ratified and approved; provided, that Whitebox will abide by the confidentiality provisions of any confidentiality agreement, non-disclosure agreement or similar agreement executed by the Company in connection with a Matter that pertain to Confidential Information; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, Whitebox shall have no obligation hereunder or under any such confidentiality agreement, non-disclosure agreement or similar agreement with respect to any Confidential Information which (a) is or becomes available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by Whitebox or its Representatives (as such term is hereinafter defined) in violation hereof, (b) was available to Whitebox on a non-confidential basis prior to its disclosure by or at the request of the Company (including without limitation by any of the Representatives of the Company), (c) becomes available to Whitebox on a non-confidential basis from a person (other than the Company or any of its Representatives) who is not known to Whitebox to be prohibited from disclosing such information to Whitebox by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation, or (d) is independently developed by Whitebox or on Whitebox’s behalf without violating any of Whitebox’s obligations hereunder; and provided, further, that Whitebox and its Representatives and Representatives of the Company (including directors of the Company that may be otherwise affiliated with Whitebox) shall not be prohibited from obtaining, using or retaining any Confidential Information for purposes of monitoring and evaluating Whitebox’s (or its affiliates) investment in the Company or exercising any voting, governance, control or other rights and
