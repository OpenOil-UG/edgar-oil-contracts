Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Holders may transfer their shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 4.5 and (ii) CCMP shall be permitted to Transfer its shares or acquire shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 4.3, Section 4.9 and Article 8, so long as with respect to an acquisition of shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 4.3 or Section 4.9 only that would cause a “Change of Control” as defined above, the Company is able to refinance its Senior Notes on terms not materially less favorable than the terms of each respective Senior Note and not on terms materially less favorable to similarly situated companies with similar credit ratings.        3.1    Termination of Rights.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, all rights for any Party set forth in this Article 3 shall terminate and be of no further force and effect on the earlier of (x) the closing date of a Qualified IPO or (y) the date that such Party and its Permitted Transferees cease to beneficially own 5% or more of the Company’s Fully-Diluted Common Stock.3.2    Financial Statements.(d)    Whether or not the Company is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Company will prepare and deliver to the Principal Investors, without any cost to such Principal Investors and within the time periods specified by the Exchange Act with respect to a non-accelerated filer (or such earlier date as the Company is required by the Exchange Act to file such documents), audited consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of the end of each fiscal year of the Company and the related audited consolidated statement of operations, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows of the Company for such fiscal year (or similar statements if such statements change as the result of changes in GAAP), together with the notes related thereto.

The filing of the financial statements with the Commission shall satisfy the foregoing obligations.(f)    The Company will prepare and within forty-five (45) days following each calendar month deliver to the Principal Investors, without any cost to such Principal Investors, monthly financial statements prepared in a form and with customary information substantially similar to the monthly financials attached hereto as Exhibit A with at least the same level of description and information as set forth therein.3.3    Waiver of Claims.  The Company and each of its Subsidiaries hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives, relinquishes and releases (and covenants and agrees not to exercise, and to cause each of its Affiliates not to exercise), any claims or rights that it or any of its Affiliates may now have or hereafter acquire against any holder of class D Common Stock, any holder of class E Common Stock or Affiliate thereof that arise from or relate to the existence, payment, performance or enforcement obligation of the Company, such Subsidiary or their respective Affiliates to any Indemnitee (as defined in the Company’s Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, incorporated as amended) including any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification, whether such right to claim, take or receive from any holder of class D Common Stock or any Affiliate thereof, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or in any other manner, any payment or security or other credit support on account of such claim, remedy or right.  ARTICLE 4.     TRANSFER OF SECURITIES4.1    General Restrictions on Transfer of Common Stock.(g)    Each Holder (other than CCMP and its Permitted Transferees) agrees that, until the occurrence of a Qualified IPO, it will not, directly or indirectly, Transfer any shares of Common Stock now owned or hereafter acquired by such party (or any interest therein) to any other Person, except as expressly permitted by this Agreement. CCMP and its Permitted Transferees agree that, except with respect to twenty percent (20%) of the Common Stock owned by them (calculated immediately subsequent to the closing contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement), which may be Transferred by CCMP and its Permitted Transferees at any time so long as the requirements of Transfer set forth in the proviso in Section 4.2(a) are met, they will not Transfer any shares of Common Stock now owned or hereafter acquired by them (or any interest therein) to any other Person, except as expressly permitted by this Agreement. In addition, notwithstanding the provisions of this Article 4, Fischer may not Transfer (other than to Permitted Transferees) more than 20% of the shares of Common Stock owned by Fischer as of 15 DC\1281653.10the date of this Agreement (calculated prior to any sales pursuant to Section 4.1(b)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitation of this Section 4.1 on each of CCMP and Fischer may, at any time, be waived by the express written waiver of the other.(h)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to the limitations contained in the penultimate sentence of Section 4.1(a), Fischer may sell up to an aggregate of twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000) of Common Stock in one or a combination of the following transactions:  (i) up to ten million dollars ($10,000,000) of Common Stock to CCMP on the date hereof at the same price per share paid by CCMP for the Common Stock pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement; (ii) after eighteen (18) months following the Original Date and so long as a Qualified IPO has not yet occurred, up to fifteen million dollars ($15,000,000) of Common Stock in a private offering, provided, however, that if Fischer elects to sell Common Stock pursuant to this Section 4.1(b)(ii),  Fischer must first offer to sell to CCMP all such Common Stock to be sold pursuant to this Section 4.1(b)(ii) and Fischer shall have all of the obligations of a ROFO Seller and the offer pursuant to this Section 4.1(b)(ii) shall be governed by the procedures set forth in Section 4.9, solely with respect to CCMP; and (iii) in connection with a Qualified IPO, the Company shall use its reasonable efforts to permit the sale of up to twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000) of Common Stock, less the amount sold in Sections 4.1(b)(i) and (ii) above, if any.(i)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, Altoma may sell up to ten million dollars ($10,000,000) of Common Stock to CCMP on the date hereof at the same price per share of Common Stock paid by CCMP for the Common Stock pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement.4.2    Permitted Transferees.(a)    Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (other than Section 4.8), any Principal Investor or any Permitted Transferee thereof may, without the consent of the Company or any of the Parties and without compliance with Sections 4.1, 4.4, 4.5 or 4.9, at any time Transfer any or all of its shares of Common Stock to one or more Permitted Transferees, provided that (i) the Transfer to such Person is not in violation of applicable U.S. federal or state securities laws, or other similar laws, and (ii) such Permitted Transferee(s) shall execute and deliver to the Company a written acknowledgement, in form and substance satisfactory to the Company, stating that such Permitted Transferee(s) agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement (on the same terms as such Transferring Person).(b)    Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (but subject to Section 4.8), any Other Party may, without the consent of the Company or any of the Parties and without compliance with Sections 4.1, 4.4, 4.5, or 4.9 at any time Transfer any or all of its shares of Common Stock to one or more Other Permitted Transferees, provided that (i) the Transfer to such Person is not in violation of applicable U.S. federal or state securities laws, or other similar laws, (ii) such Permitted Transferee(s) shall execute and deliver to the Company a written acknowledgement, in form and substance satisfactory to the Company, stating that such Permitted Transferee(s) agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement (on the same terms as such Other Party), and (iii) if any such Other Permitted Transferee shall cease to qualify as an 16 DC\1281653.10Other Permitted Transferee after such Transfer, such Transferring Other Party shall cause such Other Permitted Transferee to transfer to such Other Party or another Other Permitted Transferee of such Other Party all Common Stock owned by such Other Permitted Transferee immediately prior to the time such Other Permitted Transferee would cease to be an Other Permitted Transferee of such Other Party.(c)    Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, upon the death of any Party who is a natural person, the Transfer of any or all of such Party’s shares of Common Stock to one or more of such Party’s legatees, heirs or trustees of a testamentary trust, or to an executor or administrator of the estate of such deceased Party incident to guardianship or probate proceedings involving such estate shall not require the consent of the Company or any of the Parties and shall not be subject to compliance with Sections 4.1, 4.4, 4.5 or 4.9 so long as (i) such Person(s) shall execute and deliver to the Company a written acknowledgement, in form and substance satisfactory to the Company, stating that such Person(s) agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement (on the same terms as such Other Party), and (ii) the Transfer to such Person(s) is not in violation of Applicable Law.4.3    Altoma Shares.(b)    After August 15, 2011, if the Common Stock of the Company is not listed on a national securities exchange or quoted on the Nasdaq National Market (or successor quotation system or exchange), the Altoma Parties will have the right, from time to time and in one or more transactions, to Transfer to any Person its Common Stock pursuant to a Demand Request as set forth in Section 6.1(b).  However, notwithstanding Altoma’s right to a Demand Request set forth in Section 6.1(b), prior to making such Demand Request, each of the Altoma Parties agrees to offer its shares of Common Stock to be Transferred first to the Company (who may elect to purchase any or all of the offered shares) for purchase at Fair Market Value.  Such offer by the Altoma Parties shall be in writing and delivered to the Company, CCMP and Fischer.  In the event the Company elects to purchase less than all of Altoma’s shares of Common Stock offered for Transfer, the remaining shares will be offered to CCMP and Fischer pro rata based on percentage ownership of the Common Stock (who collectively may elect to purchase any or all of the remaining offered shares) at Fair Market Value.  Should either of CCMP or Fischer elect to purchase less than their pro rata share of the Common Stock, the other Party may elect to purchase more than its pro rata share up to the full balance of offered shares remaining.  The Company shall give written notice of its election to purchase such offered shares within twenty (20) Business Days after receipt of the Altoma Parties offer and CCMP and Fischer shall give written notice of their respective elections by the earlier of (i) twenty (20) Business Days following the written notice of election by the Company or (ii) forty (40) Business Days after the Altoma Parties’ original offer notice.  In the event that the Company, CCMP or Fischer exercise the option to purchase the shares of Common Stock offered by the Altoma Parties pursuant to this Section, each of the Altoma Parties agrees to finance up to 66 2/3% of the purchase price payable by the Company or Fischer under substantially the same terms and conditions as specified under Section 4.3(b) of this Agreement, provided, that the amount permitted to be financed by the Company will be reduced by the amount of funds that are (i) reasonably available to the Company and may be used to purchase Altoma’s Common Stock without 17 DC\1281653.10violation of the Existing Credit Facility or other document evidencing Indebtedness, and (ii) are not reasonably necessary for the ongoing operations or budgeted capital expenditures in the foreseeable future following the date of the Altoma offer.  If the Company, CCMP and Fischer (i) provide notice of their intent not to purchase any of such offered shares, (ii) do not provide notice of their intent to purchase on or before forty (40) Business Days after the date of receipt of the Altoma Parties original offer notice, or (iii) fail to consummate a purchase of 100% of the shares offered by the Altoma Parties in accordance with this Section 4.3(a), each of the Altoma Parties will have the right, but not the obligation, for 120 days thereafter to:  (1) Transfer in an offering the amount of Common Stock offered less the amount of shares of Common Stock Transferred to the Company and/or CCMP and the Fischer Parties pursuant to the offering in this Section 4.3(a), to any person at a price equal to or greater than the price at which it was offered to the Company, CCMP and Fischer, or if such proposed sale price is less than that offered to the Company, CCMP and Fischer, to provide the Company, CCMP and Fischer a right to purchase the remaining shares at the lower price (by complying again with the provisions of this Section 4.3(a)) before selling to another person, or (2) effect a Demand Request in accordance with Section 6.1(b), wherein each of the Altoma Parties agrees to offer for Transfer in such registration statement all of the Common Stock which has not been purchased pursuant to the offering in this Section 4.3(a).  Transfers of shares of Common Stock by the Altoma Parties pursuant to this Section 4.3 shall not be subject to the provisions of Sections 4.1(a), 4.4 or 4.9.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company’s ability to participate in purchases of Common Stock under this Section 4.3 is subject to the approval of the holders of the Company’s class E common stock as set forth in the Company’s certificate of incorporation.(c)    Any deferred portion of the purchase price pursuant to Section 4.3(a) above payable by the Company or Fischer shall be evidenced by a promissory note (“Promissory Note”) of the purchaser containing the following terms:(i)    The Promissory Note shall bear interest at a fixed annual percentage rate equal to the prime rate in effect by JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. on the date of the Closing, may be prepaid at any time without penalty (any principal prepayment shall be applied against the next maturing installment of principal), shall provide for acceleration upon default, penalty interest, notice and opportunity to cure upon default, and such other standard and customary terms as the parties may agree.  Except during any period in which the payments due under the Promissory Note are tolled pursuant to Section 4.3(b)(iii), the Promissory Note shall require equal semi-annual payments of principal plus accrued interest over a term of two (2) years.  The first such payment shall be due on the first semi-annual anniversary of the closing of the sale pursuant to Section 4.3(a), and subsequent payments shall be due consecutively on the subsequent semi-annual anniversaries of such date until the second anniversary date at which time the unpaid balance of the Promissory Note plus accrued interest shall be due and payable.(ii)    The payment of the Promissory Note shall be secured at any time and from time to time by that number of shares of Common Stock which equals 18 DC\1281653.10one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the value of the unpaid principal amount remaining under the Promissory Note at such time, not to exceed in any case more than the original number of shares of Common Stock repurchased by the Company or purchased by Fischer.  For purposes of this Section 4.3(b)(ii), the value of the shares of Common Stock held as security for the payment of the Promissory Note shall be their Fair Market Value.  At any time and from time to time, the purchaser shall be entitled to a release of collateral to the extent that the value of the Common Stock held by the holder of the Promissory Note exceeds the unpaid principal amount remaining under the Promissory Note by more than fifty percent (50%).  Upon request by the purchaser for such release, the holder of the Promissory Note shall exchange the stock certificate held as collateral for a new stock certificate which reflects the release of shares pursuant to this provision.  In addition to the release of collateral described above, the purchaser shall have the right, at any time and from time to time, to substitute certificates of deposit issued by any state or national bank as security for the purchaser’s obligations.  The shares of Common Stock shall be released in such amount so that the sum of the face value of the certificate of deposit and one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the Fair Market Value of the shares of Common Stock retained by the holder of the Promissory Note as of the end of the most recent fiscal quarter for the Company for which financial statements are available equals the unpaid principal amount remaining under the Promissory Note.  So long as the purchaser is not in default under the Promissory Note, the purchaser shall be entitled to receive all interest earned on such substituted collateral.(iii)    Any Promissory Note issued by the Company pursuant to this Section 4.3(b) shall provide that it is payable only out of “surplus” (as described in §154 of the Delaware General Corporation Law), and shall further provide that, in the event the Company shall not, at the time set for any payment, have available an adequate surplus from which to make such payment, or any portion thereof, the Company shall not make such payment, or such portion thereof, as the case may be, and the date for payment, or such portion thereof, shall be tolled, with interest accruing thereon until such surplus is available.  The provisions of this Agreement regarding the Company’s issuance and payment of Promissory Notes only from surplus shall not be construed to impose on the Company any obligation to create or generate any surplus of any type whatsoever.  However, each year the Company shall not declare any cash or stock dividend or voluntarily cause any other charge to be made against surplus if the result thereof would be to cause surplus to fall below the level needed to make any payment(s) on a Promissory Note(s) which is payable during such year period or whose payment has been and is, at the time of such dividend or charge, tolled pursuant to this Section 4.3(b)(iii).  In the event the payment of any installment on any Promissory Note is tolled for a period of more than six (6) months, such Promissory Note shall be in default, and the holder of such Promissory Note may, upon notice of default by the holder and failure of the payee to make such payment within 30 days after the date such notice is received, declare the 19 DC\1281653.10principal and all interest accrued thereon to be due and payable and may foreclose on any shares of Common Stock or other collateral which shall be the security therefor.(d)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the exercise by CCMP of its rights under this Section 4.3 would cause a “Change of Control” as defined in Section 3.4(b), the period of time to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Section 4.3 can be delayed for up to 90 days to effect a refinancing of the Company’s outstanding Senior Notes as contemplated by Section 3.4(b).4.4    Tag-Along Rights.(a)    Prior to a Qualified IPO, in the event of a proposed Transfer by a Holder (a “Tag-Along Seller”) of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock in one or a series of related transactions for value in a Bona Fide Offer other than (w) Transfers made pursuant to Section 4.1(a) by CCMP, and Transfers pursuant to Section 4.1(b), Section 4.1(c) or Section 4.3, (x) to a Permitted Transferee or Other Permitted Transferee, (y) in connection with a Qualified IPO, or (z) any transaction in which all of the Parties agree to participate, the Holders other than the Tag-Along Seller (the “Tag-Along Participants”) shall have the right to participate on the same terms and conditions and for the same consideration per share of Common Stock as the Tag-Along Seller in the Transfer in the manner set forth in this Section 4.4, regardless of whether the purchaser is a Holder exercising its right to purchase the Tag-Along Securities (defined below) by exercise of the rights of first offer set forth in Section 4.9 hereof or otherwise.  Prior to any such Transfer, the Tag-Along Seller shall deliver to the Company prompt written notice (the “Tag-Along Notice”), which the Company will forward to the Tag-Along Participants within five (5) days of receipt thereof, which notice shall state (i) the name of the proposed Transferee, (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock proposed to be Transferred (the “Tag-Along Securities”) and the percentage (the “Tag-Along Percentage”) that such number of shares constitute of the total number of shares of Common Stock owned by such Tag-Along Seller, (iii) the proposed purchase price therefore, including a description of any non-cash consideration sufficiently detailed to permit the determination of the Fair Market Value thereof, and (iv) the other material terms and conditions of the proposed Transfer, including the proposed Transfer date (which date may not be less than twenty (20) days after delivery to the Tag-Along Participants of the Tag-Along Notice).  Such notice shall be accompanied by a written offer from the proposed Transferee to purchase the Tag-Along Securities, which offer may be conditioned upon the consummation of the sale by the Tag-Along Seller, or the most recent drafts of the purchase and sale documentation between the Tag-Along Seller and the Transferee which shall make provision for the participation of the Tag-Along Participants in such sale consistent with this Section 4.4.  A Tag-Along Seller may only Transfer its shares of Common Stock under this Section 4.4 if it has satisfied the provisions of Section 4.1(b), Section 4.5 and Section 4.9, as applicable, with respect to such proposed Transfer.(b)    Each Tag‑Along Participant may elect to participate in the proposed Transfer to the proposed Transferee identified in the Tag-Along Notice by giving written notice to the Company and to the Tag-Along Seller within the fifteen (15) day period after the delivery 20 DC\1281653.10of the Tag-Along Notice to such Tag-Along Participant, which notice shall state that such Tag‑Along Participant elects to exercise its rights of tag‑along under this Section 4.4 and shall state the maximum number of shares sought to be Transferred (which number may not exceed the product of (i) all shares of Common Stock owned by such Tag-Along Participant, multiplied by (ii) the Tag-Along Percentage).  Each Tag‑Along Participant shall be deemed to have waived its right of tag‑along with respect to the Tag-Along Securities hereunder if it fails to give notice within the prescribed time period.  The proposed Transferee of Tag-Along Securities will not be obligated to purchase a number of shares of Common Stock exceeding that set forth in the Tag-Along Notice, and in the event such Transferee elects to purchase less than all of the additional shares of Common Stock sought to be Transferred by the Tag‑Along Participants, the number of shares of Common Stock to be Transferred by the Tag-Along Seller and each such Tag‑Along Participant shall be reduced so that each such Holder is entitled to sell its pro rata portion (based on percentage ownership of Common Stock) of the number of shares of Common Stock the proposed Transferee elects to purchase (which in no event may be less than the number of Tag-Along Securities set forth in the Tag-Along Notice).(c)    Each Tag‑Along Participant, if it is exercising its tag‑along rights hereunder, shall deliver to the Tag-Along Seller at the closing of the Transfer of the Tag-Along Seller’s Tag-Along Securities to the Transferee certificates representing the Tag-Along Securities to be Transferred by such Holder, duly endorsed for transfer or accompanied by stock powers duly executed, in either case executed in blank or in favor of the applicable purchaser against payment of the aggregate purchase price therefor by wire transfer of immediately available funds.  Each Party participating in a sale pursuant to this Section 4.4 shall receive consideration in the same form and per share amount after deduction of such Party’s proportionate share of the related expenses.  Each Party participating in a sale pursuant to this Section 4.4 shall agree to make or agree to the same customary representations, covenants, indemnities and agreements as the Tag-Along Seller so long as they are made severally and not jointly and the liabilities thereunder are borne on a pro rata basis based on the consideration to be received by each Party; provided, that any general indemnity given by the Tag-Along Seller, applicable to liabilities not specific to the Tag-Along Seller, to the Transferee in connection with such sale shall be apportioned among the Parties participating in a sale pursuant to this Section 4.4 according to the consideration received by each such Party and shall not exceed such Party’s net proceeds from the sale; provided, further, that any representation relating specifically to a Party and/or its ownership of Common Stock to be Transferred shall be made only by that Party.  The fees and expenses incurred in connection with a sale under this Section 4.4 and for the benefit of all Parties (it being understood that costs incurred by or on behalf of a Party for his, her or its sole benefit will not be considered to be for the benefit of all Parties), to the extent not paid or reimbursed by the Company or the Transferee or acquiring Person, shall be shared by all the Parties on a pro rata basis, based on the consideration received by each Party in respect of its Common Stock to be Transferred; provided that no Party shall be obligated to make any out-of-pocket expenditure prior to the consummation of the transaction consummated pursuant to this Section 4.4 (excluding de minimis expenditures).  The proposed Transfer date may be extended beyond the date described in the Tag-Along Notice to the extent necessary to obtain required approvals of Governmental Entities and other required approvals and the Company and the Parties shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such approvals.21 DC\1281653.10(d)    If the Tag-Along Seller sells or otherwise Transfers to the Transferee any of its shares of Common Stock in breach of this Section 4.4, then each Tag-Along Participant shall have the right to sell to each Tag-Along Seller, and each Tag-Along Seller undertakes to purchase from each Tag-Along Participant, the number of shares of Common Stock that such Tag-Along Participant would have had the right to sell to the Transferee pursuant to this Section 4.4, for a per share amount and form of consideration and upon the terms and conditions on which the Transferee purchased such shares of Common Stock from the Tag-Along Seller, but without any indemnity being granted by any Tag-Along Participant to the Tag-Along Seller; provided that nothing contained in this Section 4.4(d) shall preclude any Party from seeking alternative remedies against any such Tag-Along Seller as a result of its breach of this Section 4.4.4.5    Drag Along Right.(a)    Prior to a Qualified IPO, (i) So long as Fischer owns at least 80% of the shares of Common Stock owned by Fischer as of the date of this Agreement (calculated prior to any sales pursuant to Section 4.1(b) and treating the shares of Common Stock Transferred pursuant to the Fischer Gift as being owned by Fischer), if both CCMP and Fischer propose to Transfer all of their Common Stock, representing more than 50% of the aggregate Voting Securities of the Company, or (ii) if Fischer does not own at least 80% of the shares of Common Stock that Fischer owns as of the date of this Agreement (calculated prior to any sales pursuant to Section 4.1(b) and treating the shares of Common Stock Transferred pursuant to the Fischer Gift as being owned by Fischer), if CCMP (so long as CCMP beneficially owns 5% or more of the Company’s Fully-Diluted Common Stock) by itself or along with any other Holders propose to Transfer all of their Common Stock, representing more than 50% of the aggregate Voting Securities of the Company (the “Drag Transaction”), then if requested by the Holder(s) Transferring such Common Stock (the “Drag-Along Seller(s)”), each other Holder (each, a “Dragged Party”) shall (i) be required to sell all of the Common Stock held by it of the same class or series as any of the Common Stock to be Transferred (or then convertible into any such class or series) in the Drag Transaction, and (ii) vote for, consent to, raise no objections to and take all actions reasonably required, necessary or desirable in connection with, such Drag Transaction.(b)    The consideration to be received by a Dragged Party shall be the same form and amount of consideration per share to be received by the Drag-Along Seller(s), and the terms and conditions of such sale shall be the same as those upon which the Drag-Along Seller(s) sells its Common Stock.   In connection with the Drag Transaction, each Dragged Party will agree to make or agree to the same customary representations, covenants, indemnities and agreements as the Drag-Along Seller(s) so long as they are made severally and not jointly and the liabilities thereunder are borne on a pro rata basis based on the consideration to be received by each Holder; provided, that (i) any general indemnity given by the Drag-Along Seller(s), applicable to liabilities not specific to the Drag-Along Seller(s), to the purchaser in connection with such sale shall be apportioned among the Dragged Parties according to the consideration received by each Dragged Party and shall not exceed such Dragged Party’s net proceeds from the sale, (ii) that any representation relating specifically to a Dragged Party and/or its Common Stock shall be made only by that Dragged Party, and (iii) in no event shall any Holder be obligated to agree to any 22 DC\1281653.10non-competition covenant or other similar agreement as a condition of participating in such Transfer.(c)    The fees and expenses incurred in connection with a sale under this Section 4.5 and for the benefit of all Holders (it being understood that costs incurred by or on behalf of a Holder for his, her or its sole benefit will not be considered to be for the benefit of all Holders), to the extent not paid or reimbursed by the Company or the Transferee or acquiring Person, shall be shared by all the Holders on a pro rata basis, based on the consideration received by each Holder in respect of its Common Stock; provided that no Holder shall be obligated to make any out-of-pocket expenditure prior to the consummation of the transaction consummated pursuant to Section 4.5 (excluding de minimis expenditures).(d)    The Drag-Along Seller(s) shall provide written notice (the “Drag-Along Notice”) to each other Dragged Party of any proposed Drag Transaction as soon as practicable following its exercise of the rights provided in Section 4.5(a).

For purposes hereof, each Preemptive Right Beneficiary’s “Proportionate Percentage” means, with respect to any Preemptive Right Beneficiary, the percentage of the New Securities allocated to such Preemptive Right Beneficiary to be determined by dividing (a) the total number of shares of Fully-Diluted Common Stock owned by such Preemptive Right Beneficiary (excluding shares issuable upon exercise of employee stock options), by (b) the total number of shares of Fully-Diluted Common Stock owned by all Preemptive Right Beneficiaries (excluding shares issuable upon exercise of employee stock options).ARTICLE 5.     INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING5.1    Demand IPO.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time (i) following the date that is eighteen (18) months after the Original Date, either (A) CCMP or (B) a majority in interest of the class B common stock and the class C common stock, voting as a single class, shall have the right, by delivery of a written notice to the Company, to demand that the Company engage in a Qualified IPO (a “Demand IPO”), if the price per share to be received by the Company or such Party or Parties, as the case may be, in such Demand IPO is at least 1.75 times the price per share paid by CCMP for the Common Stock pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement (as such price paid per share by CCMP is appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock splits, stock dividends or other similar recapitalizations), or (ii) following the date that is four (4) years after the Original Date, CCMP shall have the right, by delivery of a written notice to the Company, to demand a Demand IPO.  Upon delivery of such notice, the Company, the Principal Investors and any Permitted Transferees of any of the foregoing shall cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to facilitate the consummation of the Demand IPO, including, but not limited to, taking, facilitating or observing the actions and obligations specified in Article 7.  The Board of Directors shall have the right to appoint investment banking and legal advisors to assist the Company with the actions required under this Article 5, such investment banking and legal advisors to be reasonably acceptable to CCMP.ARTICLE 6.     REGISTRATION RIGHTS; PIGGYBACK REGISTRATION6.1    Demand Registration Rights.(e)    At any time after a Qualified IPO (the “Demand Period”), each of CCMP, Fischer and Altoma may on up to three (3) occasions make a written request of the Company (a “Demand Request”) for registration under the Securities Act (a “Demand Registration”) of Registrable Securities held by such Party or Parties, as the case may be, provided that such Registrable Securities shall have proposed offering proceeds for such offering that equal or exceed the lesser of (i) the remaining shares of Common Stock owned by such Principal Investor and (ii) US $50 million (or US $10 million in the event the Company is able to register such Registrable Securities on Form S-3).26 DC\1281653.10(f)    In addition to the Demand Requests pursuant to Section 6.1(a), Altoma may make one (1) request for registration under the Securities Act of the Common Stock held by them at any time after the date that is eighteen (18) months after the Original Date and prior to the date that notice relating to a Demand IPO has been given as provided in Section 5.1, a registration statement for a Qualified IPO has been filed or a Qualified IPO has been consummated, provided that (i) such Registrable Securities shall have proposed offering proceeds for such offering that equals or exceeds the price paid by CCMP for the Common Stock pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement (as such price paid per share by CCMP is appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock splits, stock dividends or other similar recapitalizations), (ii) the offering to be undertaken by Altoma does not involve a primary offering of Common Stock by the Company, and (iii) the corporate governance rights of CCMP, including without limitation, those contained in this Agreement and the Company’s certificate of incorporation, shall survive such offering.  The rights of Altoma set forth in this Section 6.1(b) shall terminate and be of no further force and effect if the Board of Directors of the Company recommends a transaction that would result in a Qualified IPO occurring prior to August 15, 2011, and such party votes against the proposed transaction.  For the avoidance of doubt, the obligations of the Company pursuant to this Section 6.1(b) shall be limited to the registration of the Registrable Securities pursuant to a registration statement effective with the Commission only, and the Company shall have no obligation to list or market such Registrable Securities hereunder. (g)    The Company may defer the filing (but not the preparation) of a registration statement required by this Section 6.1 until a date not later than 60 days after the Required Filing Date (as defined below) if (i) at the time the Company receives the Demand Request, the Company or its Subsidiaries are engaged in confidential negotiations, other confidential business activities or is otherwise in possession of material non-public information, disclosure of which would be required in such registration statement (but would not be required if such registration statement were not filed), and the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith that such disclosure would be materially detrimental to the Company and its stockholders, (ii) an investment banking firm advises the Company that effecting such registration would materially and adversely affect an offering of securities of the Company, or (iii) prior to receiving the Demand Request, the Board of Directors had determined to effect a registered underwritten public offering of the Company’s equity securities for the Company’s account and the Company had taken substantial steps (including, but not limited to, selecting (subject to the terms of this Agreement) and entering into a letter of intent with the Managing Underwriter for such offering) and is proceeding with reasonable diligence to effect such offering.  A deferral of the filing of a registration statement pursuant to this Section 6.1(c) shall be lifted, and the requested registration statement shall be filed forthwith, if:  in the case of a deferral pursuant to clause (i) of the preceding sentence, the negotiations or other activities are disclosed or terminated; in the case of a deferral pursuant to clause (ii) of the preceding sentence, such investment banking firm advises the Company that effecting such registration would no longer materially and adversely affect an offering of securities of the Company; or, in the case of a deferral pursuant to clause (iii) of the preceding sentence, the proposed registration for the Company’s account is abandoned.  In order to defer the filing of a registration statement pursuant to this subsection (c), the Company shall promptly, upon determining to seek such deferral, deliver to a requesting holder a certificate signed by the president or chief executive officer of 27 DC\1281653.10the Company stating that the Company is deferring such filing pursuant to this Section 6.1(c) and the basis therefor in reasonable detail.  Within twenty (20) days after receiving such certificate, the requesting holder for which registration was previously requested may withdraw such request by giving notice to the Company; if withdrawn, the Demand Request shall be deemed not to have been made for all purposes of this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may not defer the filing of a registration statement pursuant to this Section 6.1(c) more than twice every 12 months.(h)    Each Demand Request shall specify the number of shares of Registrable Securities proposed to be sold.  Subject to this Section 6.1(d), the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to file the Demand Registration within 60 days after receiving a Demand Request (the “Required Filing Date”) and shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the same to be declared effective by the Commission as promptly as practicable after such filing, provided that the Company need effect only one Demand Registration at any time in accordance with this Section 6.1.  The Company shall pay all of its fees, costs and expenses, other than underwriting discounts and commissions, related to any such Demand Registration; provided, however, if the Demand Registration is subsequently withdrawn by the Party or Parties initiating the Demand Registration, the Party or Parties may decide either (i) to pay pro rata any expenses of such registration and retain their rights to such Demand Registration or (ii) to elect to have the Company bear such expenses (in which event such Demand Registration shall count as one of such Party’s demands for Demand Registration).(i)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company shall not be required to register any Person’s Registrable Securities pursuant to a Demand Registration unless such Person accepts the terms of the underwriting agreement, if any, between the Company and the Underwriter.6.2    Piggyback Registration.  Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, if the Company proposes to file a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to an offering of any equity securities by the Company for its own account or for the account of any of its equity holders, including a registration statement filed pursuant to Section 6.1, (other than a registration statement on Form S-4 or Form S-8 (or such corresponding forms adopted by the Commission for use by foreign issuers), or any substitute form that may be adopted by the Commission, or any registration statement filed in connection with an exchange offer or offering of securities solely to the Company’s existing security holders), then the Company shall give written notice of such proposed filing to the Principal Investors as soon as practicable (but in no event less than 30 days before the anticipated effective date of such registration statement), and such notice shall offer each such Party and its Permitted Transferees the opportunity to register the Applicable Percentage of the Registrable Securities held by each such Party and its Permitted Transferees (a “Piggyback Registration”).  Subject to the limitations in Sections 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6 and 6.9 hereof, the Company shall include in each such Piggyback Registration all Registrable Securities requested to be included in the registration for such offering.  Each such holder of Registrable Securities shall be permitted to withdraw all or part of such holder’s Registrable Securities from a Piggyback Registration at any time prior to the effective date thereof.28 DC\1281653.106.3    Obligations of the Company.  Whenever required under this Article 6 to effect the registration of any Registrable Securities, the Company shall, as expeditiously as reasonably possible:(g)    Prepare and file with the Commission a registration statement with respect to such Registrable Securities and use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective, and keep such registration statement effective for up to 120 days; provided, however, that if Holders of Registrable Securities holding shares having an aggregate value in excess of ten million dollars ($10,000,000) request that such registration statement be filed on Form S-3 under Rule 415 on a continuous basis and such filing is permitted under applicable Commission rules, the Company shall keep such registration statement effective until all such Registrable Securities are sold thereunder and/or cease to be Registrable Securities, or for two years if earlier, provided that the aggregate value of shares registered under such registration statement also exceeds ten million dollars ($10,000,000).(h)    Prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection with such registration statement as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such registration statement for up to 120 days, or such longer period in connection with a Rule 415 offering described in Section 6.3(a) above.(i)    Furnish to the Parties such numbers of copies of a prospectus, including a preliminary prospectus, in conformity with the requirements of the Securities Act, and such other documents as they may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of Registrable Securities owned by them.(j)    Use its reasonable efforts to register and qualify the securities covered by such registration statement under such other securities or “blue sky” laws of such jurisdictions in the United States as shall be reasonably requested by the Parties, provided that the Company shall not be required in connection therewith or as a condition thereto to qualify to do business or to file a general consent to service of process in any such states or jurisdictions.(k)    In the event of any underwritten public offering, enter into and perform its obligations under an underwriting agreement, in usual and customary form, with the Managing Underwriter of such offering.(l)    Notify each Party covered by such registration statement at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the Securities Act of the happening of any event as a result of which the prospectus included in such registration statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances then existing, such obligation to continue for 120 days, or such longer period in connection with a Rule 415 offering described in Section 6.3(a) above.29 DC\1281653.10(m)    Except for registrations pursuant to Section 6.1(b), use its reasonable efforts to cause all such Registrable Securities registered pursuant hereunder to be listed on each securities exchange on which the same securities issued by the Company are then listed.(n)    Provide a transfer agent and registrar for all Registrable Securities registered pursuant hereto and a CUSIP number for all such Registrable Securities, in each case not later than the effective date of such registration.(o)    Except for registrations pursuant to Section 6.1(b), use its reasonable efforts to furnish, at the request of any Party requesting registration of Registrable Securities pursuant to this Article 6, on the date that such Registrable Securities are delivered to the underwriters for sale in connection with a registration pursuant to this Article 6, if such securities are being sold through Underwriters, or, if such securities are not being sold through Underwriters, on the date that the registration statement with respect to such securities becomes effective, (i) an opinion, dated such date, of the counsel representing the Company for the purposes of such registration, in form and substance as is customarily given to Underwriters in an underwritten public offering, addressed to the Underwriters, if any, and to the Party or Parties requesting registration of Registrable Securities and (ii) a letter dated such date, from the independent certified public accountants of the Company, in form and substance as is customarily given by independent certified public accountants to underwriters in an underwritten public offering, addressed to the underwriters, if any, and to the Parties requesting registration of Registrable Securities.6.4    Indemnification.  In the event any Registrable Securities are included in a registration statement under this Article 6:(a)    To the extent permitted by law, the Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Party, each of its officers, directors, partners, legal counsel, accountants, and any underwriter (as defined in the Securities Act) for such Party and each Person, if any, who controls such Party or underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, against any losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (joint or several) to which they may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any of the following statements, omissions or violations (collectively a “Violation”):  (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such registration statement, including any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein or any amendments or supplements thereto, (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (iii) any violation or alleged violation by the Company of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any state securities law or any rule or regulation promulgated under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any state securities law; and the Company will pay to each such Party, each of its officers, directors, partners, legal counsel, accountants, and any underwriter or controlling person, as incurred, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 6.4(a) shall not apply 30 DC\1281653.10to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), nor shall the Company be liable to any Party, each of its officers, directors, partners, legal counsel, accountants, and any underwriter or controlling Person for any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action to the extent that it arises out of or is based upon a Violation which occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished expressly for use in connection with such registration by any such Party, underwriter or controlling Person.(b)    To the extent permitted by law, each selling Party will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who has signed the registration statement, each Person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, legal counsel for the Company, accountants for the Company, any underwriter, any other Party selling securities in such registration statement and any controlling Person of any such underwriter or other Party, against any losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (joint or several) to which any of the foregoing Persons may become subject, under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect thereto) arise out of or are based upon any Violation, in each case to the extent (and only to the extent) that such Violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by such Party expressly for use in connection with such registration; and each such Party will pay, as incurred, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by any person intended to be indemnified pursuant to this Section 6.4(b), in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 6.4(b) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, that in no event shall any indemnity under this Section 6.4(b) exceed the net proceeds from the offering received by such Party, except in the case of willful fraud by such Party.(c)    Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 6.4 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this Section 6.4, deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the parties; provided, however, that an indemnified party (together with all other indemnified parties which may be represented without conflict by one counsel) shall have the right to retain one separate counsel, with the reasonable fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding.  The failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action, if prejudicial to its ability to defend such action, shall relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the indemnified party under this Section 6.4, but the omission so to deliver written 31 DC\1281653.10notice to the indemnifying party will not relieve it of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 6.4.(d)    If the indemnification provided for in Section 6.4 is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party with respect to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense referred to therein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party hereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of the indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense as well as any other relevant equitable considerations; provided, that in no event shall any contribution by a Party under this Section 6.4(d) exceed the net proceeds from the offering received by such Party, except in the case of willful fraud by such Party.  The relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.(e)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the provisions on indemnification and contribution contained in the underwriting agreement entered into in connection with the underwritten public offering are in conflict with the foregoing provisions, the provisions in the underwriting agreement shall control with respect to the Company and the Parties.(f)    The obligations of the Company and Parties under Section 6.4 shall survive the completion of any offering of Registrable Securities in a registration statement under this Article 6, and otherwise.6.5    Reports Under Exchange Act.  With a view to making available to the Parties the benefits of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act and any other rule or regulation of the Commission that may at any time permit a Party to sell securities of the Company to the public without registration or pursuant to a registration on Form S-3, the Company agrees to:(a)    make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood and defined in Commission Rule 144, at all times after 90 days after the effective date of the first registration statement filed by the Company for the offering of its securities to the general public so long as the Company remains subject to the periodic reporting requirements under Sections 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act;(b)    take such action, including the voluntary registration of its Common Stock under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, as is necessary to enable the Parties, if requested pursuant to a Demand Registration, to utilize Form S-3 for the sale of their Registrable Securities, such action to be taken as soon as practicable after the end of the fiscal year in which the first registration statement filed by the Company for the offering of its securities to the general public is declared effective;32 DC\1281653.10(c)    file with the Commission in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of the Company under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act; and(d)    furnish to any Party, so long as the Party owns any Registrable Securities, forthwith upon request (i) a written statement by the Company that it has complied with the reporting requirements of Commission Rule 144 (at any time after 90 days after the effective date of the first registration statement filed by the Company), the Securities Act and the Exchange Act (at any time after it has become subject to such reporting requirements), or that it qualifies as a registrant whose securities may be resold pursuant to Form S-3 (at any time after it so qualifies), (ii) a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the Company and such other reports and documents so filed by the Company, and (iii) such other information as may be reasonably requested in availing any Party of any rule or regulation of the Commission which permits the selling of any such securities without registration or pursuant to such form.6.6    No Assignment of Demand Rights.  The rights to cause the Company to register Registrable Securities pursuant to Section 6.1 may not be assigned to third parties except to a Permitted Transferee controlled by CCMP, Fischer or Altoma.6.7    Limitations on Subsequent Registration Rights.  From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall not enter into any agreement with any holder or prospective holder of any securities of the Company which would grant such holder or prospective holder registration rights that are more favorable than the registration rights of CCMP, Fischer or Altoma.6.8    Selection of Underwriters.  The Board of Directors shall have the right to designate the book-running managing Underwriter(s) (the “Managing Underwriter(s)”) with respect to any Piggyback Registration or Demand Registration, or with respect to any other underwritten public offering of Registrable Securities or other securities of the Company and shall select such additional Underwriters to be used in connection with the offering, if any, provided that, with respect to any Piggyback Registration or Demand Registration triggered by CCMP or in which CCMP is a participant, such Managing Underwriter designation shall be reasonably acceptable to CCMP.  The Board of Directors shall also have the right to select one or more co-managers for each such offering if the Board of Directors, in their sole discretion, shall determine that any be necessary, and the underwriting fees related to any such offering shall be allocated among any such co-managers in such proportions as the Board of Directors shall determine.  In the event of any such offering, the Managing Underwriter(s), the Company and any selling stockholders will enter into an agreement appropriate to the circumstances, containing provisions for, among other things, compensation, indemnification, contribution, and representations and warranties, which are usual and customary for similar agreements entered into by the Managing Underwriter(s) or other investment bankers of national standing acting in similar transactions.6.9    Underwriters’ Cut-Backs.  The Company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Managing Underwriter or any other managing Underwriter of a proposed underwritten offering (including an offering pursuant to a Demand Registration), as the case may be, to permit the Registrable Securities requested to be included in the registration statement for such offering under Section 6.2 or pursuant to other piggyback registration rights, if any, granted by the 33 DC\1281653.10Company (“Piggyback Securities”) to be included on the same terms and conditions as any similar securities included therein.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to include any Party’s Piggyback Securities in such offering unless such Party accepts the terms of the underwriting agreement between the Company and the Managing Underwriter (or other managing Underwriter) or Underwriters, and otherwise complies with the provisions of Section 6.10 below.  If the Managing Underwriter or Underwriters of a proposed underwritten offering advise the Company in writing that in its or their opinion the total amount of securities, including Piggyback Securities, to be included in such offering is sufficiently large to potentially impede or interfere with the offering, then in such event the securities to be included in such offering shall be allocated first to the Company and then, to the extent that any additional securities can, in the opinion of such managing Underwriter or Underwriters, be sold without any such potential to impede or interfere with the offering, pro rata among the holders of Registrable Securities on the basis of the number of Registrable Securities requested to be included in such registration by each such holder.6.10    Participation.  No Party may participate in any underwritten registration under this Article 6 unless such Party (i) agrees to sell such Party’s Registrable Securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the Person entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements, (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements and this Agreement and (iii) if requested by another Person participating in such underwritten registration, agrees that all securities convertible or exchangeable into shares of Common Stock that are included in such underwritten registration shall be so converted or exchanged on or prior to the consummation thereof.6.11    Lock-Up Letters.  Each holder of Registrable Securities (whether or not such Registrable Securities are included in a registration statement pursuant hereto) agrees to execute a written agreement not to effect any public sale or distribution of the issue being registered or of any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such securities, including a sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, during the 14 days prior to, and during the 180-day period (or shorter period permitted by the Managing Underwriter, if applicable) beginning on, the effective date of a registration statement filed pursuant hereto except as part of such registration if and to the extent requested by the Company, in the case of a non-underwritten public offering, or if and to the extent requested by the Managing Underwriter or Underwriters, as the case may be, in the case of an underwritten public offering.ARTICLE 7.     REGISTRATION PROCEDURES7.1    Procedures.(e)    The Company may require each Selling Holder to promptly furnish in writing to the Company such information regarding the distribution of the Registrable Securities as it may from time to time reasonably request and such other information as may be legally 34 DC\1281653.10required in connection with any registration.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall have the right to exclude from any offering the Registrable Securities of any Selling Holder who does not comply with the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence.(f)    Each Selling Holder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company of the happening of any event that makes any statement made in a registration statement or related prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference untrue in any material respect, or that requires the making of any changes in such registration statement, prospectus or documents so that, in the case of the registration statement, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and that in the case of the prospectus, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, (i) such Selling Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the registration statement covering such Registrable Securities until such Selling Holder’s receipt of the copies of a supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by the description in this sentence and (ii) if so directed by the Company, such Selling Holder will deliver to the Company all copies, other than permanent file copies, then in such Selling Holder’s possession, of the most recent prospectus covering such Registrable Securities at the time of receipt of such notice.  In the event the Company shall give such notice, the Company shall extend the period during which such registration statement shall be maintained effective by the number of days during the period from and including the date of the giving of notice pursuant to this sentence to the date when the Company shall make available to the Selling Holders of Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement a prospectus supplemented or amended to conform with the requirements of this sentence.7.2    Registration Expenses.  In connection with any registration statement required to be filed hereunder, the Company shall pay the following registration expenses (the “Registration Expenses”):  (i) all registration and filing fees (including, without limitation, with respect to filings to be made with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority), (ii) fees and expenses of compliance with securities or blue sky laws (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel in connection with blue sky qualifications of the Registrable Securities), (iii) printing expenses, (iv) internal expenses of the Company (including, without limitation, all salaries and expenses of its officers and employees performing legal or accounting duties), (v) the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the listing on a securities exchange or inter-dealer or similar quotation system of the Registrable Securities if the Company shall choose to list such Registrable Securities (other than for registrations pursuant to Section 6.1(b)), (vi) fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company and customary fees and expenses for independent certified public accountants retained by the Company, (vii) the reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel for the Selling Holders (collectively), (viii) the fees and expenses of any special experts retained by the Company in connection with such registration, and (ix) fees and expenses of any “qualified independent underwriter” or other independent appraiser participating in an offering pursuant to Rule 2720(c) of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  The Company shall not have any obligation to pay any underwriting fees, discounts, or commissions 35 DC\1281653.10attributable to the sale of Registrable Securities or, except as provided by clause (ii) or (vii) above, any out-of-pocket expenses of the Selling Holders (or the agents who manage their accounts).7.3    Suspension Periods.  In the event the Company has filed a registration statement that has been declared effective by the Commission (including a registration statement on Form S-3 under Rule 415 that provides for periodic resales by a Selling Holder), the Company may provide notice to the Parties hereto that the Company has elected to require the suspension of the sale by the Parties of Registrable Securities (including securities registered under any such effective registration statement) (a “Suspension Period”):(g)    for the lock-up period relating to any underwritten public offering of Company securities or any private placement of Company securities made pursuant to Rule 144A; and(h)    for a period of up to 90 days if the Company is engaged in confidential negotiations, other confidential business activities or is otherwise in possession of material non-public information, disclosure of which would be required in such registration statement (but would not be required if such registration were not filed), and the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith that such disclosure would be materially detrimental to the Company and its stockholders; provided, however, that the Company may not cause a Suspension Period to occur more than twice every 12 months.ARTICLE 8.     COMPANY SALE8.1    Sale Option.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, and subject to Section 8.2, at any time subsequent to the sixth anniversary of the Original Date, and so long as a Qualified IPO has not yet occurred, CCMP shall have the option to compel the Company to initiate and consummate a sale of all or substantially all of the equity interests in or assets of the Company (a “Company Sale”) pursuant to an auction process (the “Company Sale Auction”), by the delivery to the Board of Directors of the Company and each of the Principal Investors of a written notice to that effect (a “Sale Notice”). The sale of the Company may take the form of a stock sale, asset sale, merger or any other form whatsoever, to be determined by CCMP in its sole discretion, and each Holder shall be permitted to participate in the Company Sale Auction. For the avoidance of doubt, in any sale pursuant to this Section 8.1, each Holder shall receive the same consideration per share of Capital Stock as each other Holder and the terms and conditions of such sale shall be the same for each Holder.8.2    Fischer Offer.(i)    In the event CCMP initiates a Company Sale, CCMP shall send a copy of the Sale Notice to Fischer, upon receipt of which Fischer shall have thirty (30) days (the “Fischer Offer Deadline”) to negotiate with CCMP and deliver an unconditional, fully financed offer to purchase for cash all of the equity interests in or assets of the Company proposed to be 36 DC\1281653.10sold in the Company Sale (the “Fischer Offer”), which Fischer Offer shall include terms and conditions customary for such a transaction.   If CCMP, in its sole discretion, deems the Fischer Offer acceptable, the closing for the Company Sale shall be consummated at 9:00 a.m. Oklahoma City time on the date 30 days following the Fischer Offer Deadline, at the Company’s principal executive offices, or at such other time, date and place as mutually agreed by Fischer, the Company and CCMP.  At the closing, the purchase price set forth in the Fischer Offer and accepted by CCMP shall be paid in the form of a cashier’s check or by wire transfer in same day funds, and the Company shall deliver stock certificates representing all Common Stock so purchased, accompanied by duly executed stock powers, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances and adverse claims (other than encumbrances as set forth in this Agreement), and such other instruments or documents as are deemed necessary by Fischer for the proper Transfer of such Common Stock so transferred.  In the event that the Fischer Offer is accepted by CCMP, each of Altoma and HOOPP may, in its sole discretion, elect to (i) sell the Common Stock beneficially owned by it to Fischer in accordance with the Fischer Offer, or (ii) retain its Common Stock, with such Principal Investor being deemed excluded from and not a party to the Fischer Offer.  The Company, Fischer and CCMP shall cooperate in good faith in obtaining all necessary governmental and third-party consents, approvals or waivers required for the closing.  The closing may be delayed, to the extent required, until the next succeeding day following the expiration of any required waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and the obtaining of any necessary government approvals.(j)    If, (i) CCMP, in its sole discretion, deems the price or terms of the Fischer Offer to be inadequate, or (ii) CCMP did not receive the Fischer Offer prior to the Fischer Offer Deadline (in which case the offer to Fischer to purchase the Company shall be deemed rejected), CCMP and the Company shall be entitled to pursue the Company Sale pursuant on terms no more favorable to CCMP than those offered by Fischer in the Fischer Offer.  8.3    Advisors.  In connection with a Company Sale, CCMP shall have the power to appoint investment banking and legal advisors to assist the Company with the sale, such investment banking and legal advisors to be reasonably acceptable to the Company.8.4    Reasonable Efforts.  The Principal Investors shall take all reasonable actions, including, without limitation, agreeing to tender their Capital Stock in a tender offer or agreeing to sell their Capital Stock in a stock purchase, as may be necessary to effect such a transaction. ARTICLE 9.    TERMINATION9.1    Termination.  This Agreement shall terminate upon the earlier of (i) the dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the Company or (ii) December 31, 2025.  A Person who ceases to hold any shares of Common Stock and who ceases to beneficially own any shares of Common Stock shall cease to be a Party and shall have no further rights or obligations under this Agreement other than with respect to Section 10.7.37 DC\1281653.10ARTICLE 10.     MISCELLANEOUS10.1    Amendment.  This Agreement may be amended, and the Company may take any action herein prohibited, or omit to perform any act herein required to be performed by it, only if any such amendment, action or omission to act, has been approved by Holders holding in excess of 50% of the then-outstanding Voting Securities of the Holders including CCMP, provided that each of the following shall apply to every proposed amendment to this Agreement: (a) except as permitted by clause (b) below, this Agreement may not be amended in a manner adversely affecting the rights or obligations of any Holder which does not adversely affect the rights or obligations of all similarly situated Holders in the same manner without the consent of such Holder, (b) this Agreement may not be amended in a manner affecting (adversely or otherwise) the rights or obligations of any single Principal Investor or its Permitted Transferee unless the rights and obligations of all other Principal Investors and their Permitted Transferees are affected (adversely or otherwise) in the same manner (as among such other Principal Investors), and (c) this Agreement may not be amended in a manner which would affect (adversely or otherwise) any economic rights or obligations of any Principal Investor or its Permitted Transferee without the consent of all Principal Investors.  The failure of any Party to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement shall in no way be construed as a waiver of such provisions and shall not affect the right of such Party thereafter to enforce each and every provision of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.  Any Holder may waive (in writing) the benefit of any provision of this Agreement with respect to itself for any purpose.  Any such waiver shall constitute a waiver only with respect to the specific matter described in such writing and shall in no way impair the rights of the Holder granting such waiver in any other respect or at any other time.10.2    Specific Performance.  The Parties and the Company recognize that the obligations imposed on them in this Agreement are special, unique, and of extraordinary character, and that in the event of breach by any party, damages will be an insufficient remedy; consequently, it is agreed that the Parties and the Company may have specific performance and injunctive relief (in addition to damages) as a remedy for the enforcement hereof, without proving damages.10.3    Assignment.  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the respective successors and assigns of the Parties and the Company.
