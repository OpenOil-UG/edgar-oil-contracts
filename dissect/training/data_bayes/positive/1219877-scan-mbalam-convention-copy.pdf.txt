to mine any High Grade Ore at expiration of the BF
Commissioning Deadline, subject to having reached and
maintained the Initial Beneficiation Production Capacity.
insofar as the volwnes of Low Grade Ore present within the
Exploitation Area so allow:

(D)

the conditions under which Congo Iron shall continue to
mine any High Grade Ore at expiration of the BF
Commissioning Deadline where at anytime thereafter the
Mine Project Company is not mining sufficient High Grade
Ore from the Exploitation Pennit to satisfy the Minimum
Annual Ore Production. The Beneficiation Feasibility Study
is to describe the ongoing transport and blending of the High
Grade Ore from the Nabeba Project by Railway Project
Company and Mineral Tenninal Project Company, as the
case may be, with whatever High Grade Ore is available
from the Exploitation Pennit and how this will co-exist with
the Mine Project Company having a Beneficiation Facility
which is conducting Beneficiation Operations with respect to
pagaf52

!he Low Grade Ore present withln the Exploitation Area and
which is to be processed through !he Beneficiati.o n Facility
with either the Initial Beneficiation Production Capacity or
the Interim Beneficiation Production Capacity, as the case
maybe:
(E)

the manner in which the Mine Project Company proposes to
continue to mine High Grade Ore and, at the same time,
undertake Beneuciation Operations in order to reach a
beneficiation production capacity that is higher than the
Initial Beneficiation Production Capacity, or Interim
Beneficiation Production Capacity, as the case may be,

page I 53

(h)

During the prepamtion of the Beneficiation Feasibility Study and
Beneficiation Power Station Feasibility Study, the Mine Project
Company shall consult with tl1e State in order to determine whether the
State wishes to ensure that iliere is sufficient capacity within the
Beneficiation Power Station to produce power in excess of the Mine
Project Company's requirements for tbe purposes of its Beneficiation
Operations and, to the extent tlle State wishes iliere to be such additional
capacity, it must provide such incentives or financial support to ensure
the Mine Project Company does not incur a tariff for electricity which is
greater tllan it would have, had the capacity of the Beneficiation Power
Station been no more than was needed for ilie purposes of ilie
Beneficiation Operations.

(i)

Within one hundred and eighty (I SO) Days following the date on which
tlle State receives the Beneficiation Feasibility Srudy, the State can
provide the Mine Project Company with any comment or objection to the
Beneficiation Feasibility Study. The Mine Project Company shall, to the
greatest extent possible, take into account the comments or objections
provided by the State in order to achieve a consensual Beneficiation
Feasibility Study no later than ninety (90) Days following the date on
which tlle Mine Project Company receives comments from the State on
the Beneficiation Feasibility Study. lf the Parties are unable to achieve a
consensus on Ute Beneficiation Feasibility Study, (then either Party may
refer the disagreement to ilie Expert Procedure for resolution as a
Technical Dispute; provided that a dispute regarding whether the IRR
tllresbold component in the BF Construction Conditions has been met
shall be subject to resolution as an ordinary Dispute rather than a
Technical Dispute.

(j)

Where a Beneficiation Feasibility Study demonstrates that tlle conditions
in the BF Construction Conditions are not met then the State cannot
require the Mine Project Company to conduct the Beneficiation
Operations.

(k)

If by operation of Article I0.1 (j) above and notwithstanding anything else
in this Article I 0, if tlle Mine Project Company is not obliged to conduct
the Beneficiation Operations, then the Mine Project Company may
nevertheless commit in writing to conduct the Beneficiation Operations,
subject to the tenns of the Project Agreements (a ''Beneficiation
Election").

(I)

A "Positive Beneficiation Determination" means if: (i) a Beneficiation
Feasibility Study demonstrates that the BF Construction Conditions have
been met; or (ii) a Beneficiation Election has been made.

(m)

Upon tl1e occurrence of a Positive Beneficiation Determination, tbe State
and Cam Iron or the Mine Project Company shall agree on a set of
milestones for the construction and conunissioning of the Beneficiation
Facility.

10.2

(a)

Obligation to Conduct Beneficiation Operations
The Mine Project Company undertakes to construct and commission ilie
Beneficiation Facility and conduct the Beneficiation Operations in
accordance \vith the Beneficiation Specifications and, generally, in
pagaj54

.,

accordance with and subject to this Article 10 and the Beneficiation
Agreement.
(b)

For the avoidance of doubt, the Beneficiation Facility shall be built
specifically 10 allow Beneficiation of the Low Grade Ore in accordance
with the provisions of this Convention and the Beneficiation Agreement.

(c)

At any time during the Tenn of the Project, in the event of there being a
processing unit within the territory of the State capable of processing the
Beneficiated Ore produced by the Mine Project Company, the Mine
Project Company must sell at least fifteen percent ( 15%) in the aggregate
of the total production of Beneficiated Ore to local processing facilities or
steel mills (whether owned by the State or a Third Party located within
the State) under financial tcnns and conditions that are consistent with
international benchmark pricing and trading terms. If no Beneficiated
Ore is able to be sold locally and in any ease, for all Beneficiated Ore
which is not sold locally, it is to be expotied "as is''.

(d)

If any Beneficiated Ore is processed into pellets by the Mine Project
Company and there is a pelletisation facility that is a Cameroonian
company that could process a portion of the Beneficiated Ore, then at
least ftfteen percent (J 5%) of the Beneficiated Ore will be processed by
the Cameroonian company on reasonable terms and competitive prices.
Power Supply

10.3

(a)

The I'ru1ies acknowledge that:
(i)

a key factor in being able to establish Beneficiation Operations is the
establishment or obtaining of a power supply which is of sufficient
capacity as to support those Beneficiation Operations;

(ii)

in order to provide the power referred to in Article 10.3(a)(i),
following a Positive Beneficiation Determination. lite State may,
within a period established in the Beneficiation Agreement, elect, in
its discretion, to construct, own and operate, or procure the
construction and operation of the Beneficiation Power Station. ln the
evem the State does not elect to do so, tbc Mine Project Company
shall designate one or more Third Parties approved by the State (such
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) to build, own and/or
operate the Beneficiation Power Station. The provisions set forth
herein regarding the obligations of the Mine Project Company in
respect of causing the construction and operation of the Beneficiation
Power Station shall be set forth in the Beneficiation Agreement and
shall apply to lite State in the event it elects to construct, own and
operate, or procure the construction and operation of the
Beneficiation Power Station;

(iii)

the Mine Project Company will enter into a power purchase
agreement on commercially reasonable and customary terms to
purchase lhe power required by the Mine Project Company based on
the Initial Beneficiation Production Capacity, the interim
Beneficiation Production Capacity or the Targeted Annual
Production Capacity, as applicable, and the State anticipates entering
into a power purchase agreement on commercially reasonable and
page 155

customary terms to purchase the excess power that the Mine Project
Company is not reasonably expected to progressively consume. The
terrns of the power purchase agreements, wiU be described in greater
detail in the Beneficiation Agreement; and
(iv)

the Beneficiation Power Station must be capable of providing a
power supply of the quantity and quality that is at least sufficient
enough to carry om the Beneficiation Operations.

(b)

While the Parties antic ipate thal the Mine Project Company shaU cause to
be built lht Beneficiation Power Station, the Beneficiation Agreement
will contain provisions allowing the State to elect to supply power to the
Beneficiation Facility in its sole discretion.

(c)

The Beneficiation Agreement shall describe a process by which the
Parties will consider different alternatives and cooperate to identify and
pursue a plan for building and operating the Beneficiation Facility and
Beneficiation Power Station.

I 0.4

Obligations of the Builder , Owner and Operator with Respect to the
Power Supply

If the State does not elect to build the Beneficiation Power Station, the Mine Project
Company shall obtain or cause the Third Party designated to construct the Beneficiation
Power Station to obtain whatever authorisations, approvals, consents and licences that are
necessary for such 11urd Party to build and operate the Beneficiation Power Station.
I 0.5

Procure men t Model for the Power Supply

The Beneficiation Agreement wiU, in accordance with Article I 0.3, address (a) the
procurement framework for the output of the Beneficiation Power Station and consider
components of the tariJfbased on a reasonable return of and return on equity and other factors
and (b) the term of the concession which will be tied to the duration of the Exploitation
Permit. The Beneficiation Agreement, on mutually agreeable tenns, shall also provide the
State with an option to build or cause to build the Beneficiation Power Station and to
participate in the equity funding of the Beneficiation Power Station. Power sold to purchasers
other than the Mine Project Company will not be included in the return to the equity holders
of the owner and operator ofthe Beneficiation Power Station.
10.6

Calculation oflntcrnal Rate of Return

The Beneficiation Agreement shall address the details regarding the determination of whether
the BF Construction Conditions have been met including specifying the fonnulae and
methodology for calculating the Internal Rate of Return. The Parties acknowledge that in
determining whether the BF Construction Conditions have been satisfied, the calculation of
the Internal Rate of Return shall:
(a)

be based on an asswnption that the Beneficiation Facility bas achieved
the Targeted Annual Production Capacity for each year of Beneficiation
Operations, notwithstanding the fact that the Beneficiation Facility may
only be constructed to achieve the Initial Beneficiation Production
Capacity or the Interim Beneficiation Production Capacity, or may
otherwise achieve less that the Targeting Annual Production Capacity as
page 156

a result of the flexibility being afforded to the Mine Project Company in
achieving the Targeted Annual Production Capacity; and

(b)

10.7

include the estimated investment and exploitation costs known as at Lhc
BF Construction Deadline (including reasonable contingency, escalation
and inflation allowances and the estimated charge for power supply
referred to in Article I0.5 and the forecast iron ore prices for the relevant
iron ore products based on a murually agreeable forecast such as the CRU
forecast for relevant iron ore price for the years of the Beneficiation
Operations, including the long term average where applicable, as of that
date being such that they would enable the marketing of the Beneficiated
Ore at an internationally competitive price. The Mine Project Company
is to achieve an Internal Rate of Rerum for the Beneficiation Operations
of not less than a rate equal to !he Reference Rate plus five hundred (500)
basis points.
Construction and Commissio ning of t be Beneficiation Facility

(a)

Subject to the provisions of this Article I0 and Article 55, Cam !roo
guarantees and stands surety for !he Mine Project Company to complete
the construction of the Beneficiation Facility and cause to be completed
the construction of the Beneficiation Power Station by the date ("BF
Construction Deadline") that is the latter of one hundred and twenty
( 120) months following the Date of First Commercial Shipping as the
same may be adjusted pursuant to this Convention and the Beneficiation
Agreement. The Parties anticipate that the Beneficiation Agreement will
address changes to the construction timeline based on the Positive
Beneficiation Determination being made after the time period necessary
to develop the Beneficiation Power Station and Beneficiation Facility by
the anticipated deadlines.

(b)

Notwithstanding the BF Construction Deadline, the Mine Project
Company must notify the State of the acrual date of commencement of
construction of the Beneficiation Facility and Beneficiation Power
Station within seven (7) Days of that date.

(c)

Once construction of !he Beneficiation Facility and Beneficiation Power
Station has commenced it must not be terminated nor must it be
suspended for a period of sixty ( 60} Days or more for any reason other
than the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, Legitinmte Cause,
Economic llardship or as part of the construction plan, where such
suspension does not impact the completion of construction by the BF
Construction Deadline.

(d)

Where a Force Majeure Event,r Legitimate Cause or Economic Hardship
as referred to in Article J0.7(c) occurs, the Mine Project Company must
promptly notify the State and must make all reasonable efforts
(obligation de moyens) to overcome the event. Once overcome, the Mine
Project Company must immediately notify the State and the period
during which that event occurs shall be added onto the BF
Commissioning Deadline.

(e)

The normal or early expiration of the BF Construction Deadline will be
made official by the issuance of a Finding of Compliance. In the event
that !he State makes any observations, such observations will specify the

v

pogo I 57

reservations that must be addressed prior to the BF Commissioning. The
Mine Project Company will have a period of one hundred and e ighty
(I 80) Days (or such longer period where the Mine Project Company
demonstrates in good faith that the observations cannot be accommodated
within the one hundred and eighty (180) Day period) to complete the
works aimed at addressing the reservations of the State and the SF
Conunissioning Deadline will be extended correspondingly, without
imposing any penalties on the Mine Project Company. In the event that
one or the other of the Parties refuses to sign the Finding of Compliance
free of any reservations, the most aggrieved Party shall initiate an Expert
Procedure.

(f)

Subject to the tenns of this Article 10 and Article 55, the Mine Project
Company undertakes to carry out the commissioning of the Beneficiation
Facility on the basis of at least the Initial Beneficiation Production
Capacity (and the Interim Beoeficiation Production Capacity or Targeted
Annual Production Capacity, to the extent the Beneficiation Faci lity is
ftrSt built to such capacity, as the case may be) (the "BF
Commissioning") within a time frame not to exceed three hundred a nd
sixty five (365) Days after the BF Construction Deadline is reached (the
"BF Commissioning Deadline").

(g)

Notwithstanding the applicable BF Commissioning Deadline, the Mi ne
Project Company must notify the State of the actual date of
commissioning of the Beneficiation Facility within seven (7) Days of that
date.

10.8

Fin ancing of Ben eficiation

Each of the Project Companies and the State, as a future shareholder, shall use its
reasonable endeavours to facilitate the conclusion of the financing for the
Beneficiation Facility based on project financing and minimize the amount of
equity financing required. The State must approve any such financing documents
to which it is a party. The Mine P roject Company shall maintain reserves funded
by undistributed profits as contemplated by Article 10.9.1 necessary to fund the
equity component, if anticipated by the Parties, of the financing of the Beneficiation
Facility and not require any contribution of equity from their Shareholders without
the prior written consent of the State which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. The other Project Companies shall similarly maintain reserves solely for
the purpose of funding modifications if required, to accommodate the transport or
handling of any such Beneficiated Ore with respect to their specific Project
Operations but nothing in this Article shall require a Project Company which is
established to build and operate the Beneficiation Power Station to create such a
reserve.

deployment for the purpose of fmancing the Beneficiation Facility,
provided, that such funds shall only be available to the Mine Project
Company to finance the Beneficiation Facility and to the extent not
all funds are necessary for such financing, such excess amounts shall
be distributed to the Shareholders of the Mine Project Company on a
pro rata basis, being the shareholders immediately prior to the
detennination U1at the Mine Project Company will not cause the
construction of the Beneficiation Facility to be built. lf the State,
through the Mine Project Company. has not arranged for the
utilization of such funds, for the purposes referred to in this Article,
by the tenth (I o••) anniversary, then such funds shaU be distributed to
the Shareholders of the Mine Project Company on a pro rata basis
based on the ownership interests of such Shareholders on the date
that it is detennined that the Mine Project Company will not be
complying with its obligation to construct the Beneficiation Facility.

I0.13
(a)

Production Capacity of the Beneficiation Facility
Subject to this Article 10, and as it may be modified in the Beneficiation
Agreement, the Parties agree and acknowledge, and Cam Iron undertakes
to ensure that:

(i)

the Beneficiation Facility shall initially be constructed and
commissioned to achieve at least the Initial Beneficiation Production
Capacity or the lnterim Beneficial Production Capacity in certain
circumstauces (including where the amount of High Grade Ore
remaining on the Exploitation Area is insufficient to enable the Mine
Project Company to achieve the Minimwn Annual Ore Production);

(ii)

as from the date ofBF Commissioning, and other than as is provided
page ) 61

for in this Convention, the Beneficiation Facility will, after ramp up,
produce no Jess than the Minimum Annual Beneticiated Ore
Production; and
(iii)

(b)

The Parties acknowledge that notwithstanding the Mine Project Company
achieving the BF Commissioning Deadline, and after any Beneficiation
Capacity Expansion Works, there will be a ramp-up period which will be
set out in the Beneficiatioo Feasibility Study during which actual
production will not be at the required levels referred to in Articles
l0.13(a)(i) and (ii) and during this time, the Mine Project Company will
not be in breach of this Convention or another Project Agreement.

(e)

Subject to Articles 10.14 and 55. following the completion of BF
Commissioning, the Mine Project Company must carry out all
Beneficiation Capacity Expansion Works necessary to maintain actual
annual production capacity at a level equal to the Targeted Annual
Production Capacity. The capacity of the Beneficiation Facility will need
to be expanded where either:
(i)

the High Grade Ore that is being blended no longer contains within
the blend, the Minimum Annual Ore Production from the
Exploitation Permit; and/or

(ii)

the total High Grade Ore being mined from the Exploitation Permit
and the Nabeba Permit together with the Minimum Annual
Beneficiated Ore Productioo is less than the Targeted Annual
Production Capacity.

(d)

\

v

as the capacity to produce High Grade Ore from the Project reduces
over time the production capacity of the Beneficiatioo Facility will be
increased in order to ensure the Beneficiation Facility, once built to a
capacity of thirty-five (35) million Tonnes per annum and after rampup, produces Beneficiated Ore in an amount not less than the
Targeted Annual Production Capacity.

On each occasion that the Mine Project Company must undertake
Beneficiation Capacity Expansion Works in order to maintain the
Targeted Annual Production Capacity, the Mine Project Company must:
(i)

ootify the State of the proposed schedule for the commencement of
construction and the completion of the relevant Beneficiation
Capacity Expansion Works (the "Proposed Expansion Schedule")
at least one hundred and eighty (I 80) Days prior to the
commencement of such construction works;

(ii)

obtain the State's approval, which will not be Wlfeasonably withheld,
for any changes to the Proposed Expansion Schedule;

(iii)

notify the State of the actual date of commencement of construction
of the relevant Beneficiation Capacity Expansion Works within seven
(7) Days of that date; and

(iv)

notify the State of the actual date of the completion of the
Beneficiation Facility Commissioning of the relevant Beneficiation
Capacity Expansion Works within seven (7) Days of that date.
pagol62

The acknowledgement referred to in Article 10. 13(d)(iii) applies to each time
Beneficiation Capacity Expansion Works are undertaken.
10.14

Beneficiation Expansion Conditions

The Project Companies are responsible for obtaining all Governmental Approvals
necessary for Beneficiation Capacity Expansion Works, and the State will not
unreasonably deny a request for such Govenunental Approvals.
I 0.15

Legal Regime applicable to the Assets comprising the Beneficiation
Facility

Except as set forth in the Project Agreemems, the State may elect to purchase all or
some of the Assets comprising the Beneficiation Facility made available, acquired,
constructed. installed and/or processed by the Mine Project Company (or on its behalf
or for its benefit) upon the expiry, withdrawal or termination of the Exploitation
Pennit in exchange for cash consideration equal to their fair market value. The
Assets purchased by the State shall, upon payment, transfer to the State without any
obligation of the Mine Project Company to pay any Taxes triggered by the transfer of
such Assets to the State.
I 0.16

Procurement

The Mine Project Company may procure, for its benefit, the conduct of all the design,
construction and maintemUlce operations of the Beneficiation Faci lity by any
Subsidiary, Contractor or Subcontractor.
10.17

Beneficiation of Other Low Grade Ore

The Project Companies will not beneficiate Other Ore m the Exploitation Area
without the censent oflhe State.
10.18

This Article I 0.18 contains Cam Iron's cemmencement to undertake
Beneficiation and the Parties agree that in the Beneficiation Agreement.
they will include provisions which allow Cam Iron or the Mine Project
Company to commence Beneficiation both:

(a)

(b)

Early Beneficiation

(i)

earlier than contemplated in this Convention; and

(ii)

using a Beneficiation Facility that is sized differently to the size of
what has been contemplated to date.
Notwithstanding Article 10.18(a), nothing in that Article is intendod to
limit or release Cam Iron and the Mine Project Company of any liability
or commitment to build a Beneficiation Facility capable of achieving the
Targeted Annual Production Capacity and its other obligations under
Article 10.

29.5.1 Management of the direct environmental and social impact

(a)

As the Project is located in the heart of the second largest ecological
reserve in the world and in the border area with the Republic of Congo.
the Republic of Gabon and the Central African Republic, the State has
determined it is necessary to implement a specific planning and
development program for the South and East Re&>ions of Cameroon (the
"South and East Regions Plan ") with a view to managing the social and
environmental impact resulting from the Project.

(b)

Although it is primarily the State's responsibility, the implementation of
the South and East Regions Plan calls for an involvement of Cam Iron, as
a corporate citizen, to prevent the risk of the adverse social and
environmental impact that will be generated by the Project.

(c)

Cam Iron's joint social liability with the State shall not be deemed to
relieve it of its obligations under the Environmental and Social
Assessment Management Plan to address the immediate impact of the
Project.

(d)

Accordingly, in addition to its other obligations under this Convention,
Cam Iron undertakes to make a cash contribution of twenty million
(20,000,000) US Dollars per year for five (5) years commencing on the
Date of Entry into Force to fmance the South and East Regions Plan.

(e)

The State has announced an overall fmancing commitment to implement

pagel128

lhe Soulh and East Regions Plan of eight hundred million (800,000,000)
US Dollars and, in funherance thereof, the State commits to contribute
funds for the Soulh and East Regions Plan in an amount at least equal to
the contribution of Cam Lron set forth in the preceding paragraph and
during the same five (5) year period. For avoidance of doubt, the
foregoing announcement shall in no manner give rise to any claim or
cause of action by Cam Iron or a Project Company against the State with
respect to such funding commitment.
(f)

Contributions of Cam Iron and the State in respect of the Soulh and East
Regions Plan shall be made to a specific fund administered in a manner
determined by the State that shall be set up to finance the South and East
Regions Plan (the "Special Development Fund''). The State hereby
agrees to hereinafter organize the Special Development Fund. With
respect to the long term funding of the development of the area impacted
by the Project, the State intends to allocate thirty percent (30%) of its
portion of the base charge tariff paid by Expansion Capacity users and
30% of the lease payments it receives in connection with the Mineral
Terminal Site and Railway Siie to fund the Special Development Fund.
For avoidance of doubt, the foregoi11g intention shall in no manner give
rise to any claim or cause of action by Cam Iron or a Project Company
against the State with respect to such funding commitment.

(g)

In addition, the Project Companies shall also contribute or shall cause
Marketing Company to contribute to the Special Development Fw1d
(which in addition to other uses may be used for university and technical
educational purposes) an amount equal to 0.75% of the gross sales price
of Mbalam Ore sold (whether it is sold as part of Blended Ore or
otherwise).

(h)

This fund shall be managed by a "Fund Committee" to be implemented
by the State which is to develop a plan for managing and overseeing the
use of the funds in the Special Development Fund for the activities set
forth in the South and East Regions Plan. The Fund Committee shall
consist of a number of representatives equal to twelve ( 12), of which four
(4) will be appointed by Cam Iron (but only during the Term of the
Project), four (4) by U1e Stale, and four (4) will be appointed from among
local representatives and development experts. The Parties may vary this
arrangement by mutual agreement.

(i)

fn addition to the Special Development Fund, Cam Iron w1dertakes to
fund a sustainable development and community support fund pursuant to
which Cam Iron or the Project Companies will contribute, (A) from the
Date of Entry into Force until the Date of First Commercial Shipping, the
aggregate sum of seven hundred thousand (700,000) US Dollars per year
(adjusted by the Inflation Adjustment) and (B) from and after the Date of
First Commercial Shipping, for the Term of the Project, contribute three
quarters of one percent (0. 75%) of the Project Companies' net profits
after Tax to enable Cam Iron and the Project Companies to carry out
environmental and community support programs within the framework of
the sustainable development undertakings entered into under the
Environmental and Social Assessment and Management Plan.

(j)

The Parties agree that all amounts expended from any fund established in
accordance with this Article should be audited.
page 1129

rm

(k)

The Parties will agree on a protocol to manage the Special Development
Fund and Fund Committee to ensure there is clarity and transparency
with respect to the fonnation, operation and accountability of both the
Special Development Fund and the Fw1d Committee.

29.5.2 Protection of Biodiversity and Sustainable Development ofUFA I 0-034.
(a)

The State shall:

(b)

(i)

not unreasonably withhold its consent to a request to issue to Cam
Iron the necessary authori7.ations tor such conservation activity after
the Sit,'llature Date; and

(ii)

use its reasonable efforts to do all that might be reasonably necessary
from time to time to enable the Project Companies to utilize the
carbon credits associated with the FMU.

(c)

Cam Iron will, in accordance with the Conservation Convention, submit
to the State a plan for conservation and sustainable management of the
FMU I 0-034. Cam Iron shall also (i) pay an annual fee of two thousand
(2,000) CFA Franc per hectare from the Date of Entry into Force until the
date of Project Commissioning and three thousand (3,000) CFA Franc
per hectare from and after the date of Project Commissioning, in each
case, into a fund established pursuant to the Conservation Convention,
and (ii) to fund the expenses related to such conservation.

{d)

Further, Cam Iron will fund its conservation activities within the FMU.

(e)

All funds generated by, after offsetting the reasonable costs of,
ecotourism activities in the FMU shall be transferred to the Special
Development Fund.
